Û³ This material...as issue Isù02...is an attempt to open your eyes on     ³Û
Û³ suppressed issues within our medical community. We tend to worship our  ³Û
Û³ doctors as gods who will save us from diseases. If these false gods let ³Û
Û³ us down, isn't it then time we ourselves take back the responsibility   ³Û
Û³ for our lives and well-being? As the public begins to learn of promising³Û
Û³ healing technology, they should demand to know why it is being withheld.³Û
Û³ Dr Sam Chachoua has developed a safe, effective treatment for healing   ³Û
Û³ cancer, AIDS and other related terminal illnesses years ago, but medical³Û
Û³ authorities ignore his work and try to prevent his treatments & Reseach ³Û
Û³ from becoming widely known. If you believe things of this nature doesn't³Û
Û³ happen in our society, you are simply misinformed. It is not, nor ever  ³Û
Û³ will be TEOAS's intentions for the public to believe in any published   ³Û
Û³ information blindly. Only to open there eyes to some documented fact and³Û
Û³ possibly gain enough public interest so more questions are asked and    ³Û
Û³ there answers demanded. You've seen this phrase so often "Knowledge is  ³Û
Û³ Power". With knowledge comes a certain responsibility. Knowledge isn't  ³Û
Û³ Power in itself...Applied knowledge is Power. Lets make it a point and  ³Û
Û³ goal of our underground culture to distribute suppressed information to ³Û
Û³ the public, then let them judge for themselves what the truth is. At    ³Û
Û³ least develop enough of an interest to start asking the right questions ³Û
Û³ to the correct people. Learn and be aware of what goes on in the world  ³Û
Û³ around you.                                                             ³Û

Û³ Cancer, AIDS, heart disease: three faces of death that devastate so many³Û
Û³ lives. Many believe that modern medicine will someday develop effective ³Û
Û³ therapies. Those afflicted, their friends, family, lovers, pray that the³Û
Û³ breakthroughs will come one day soon.                                   ³Û
Û³ Imagine that the world was offered new treatments and even real cures.  ³Û
Û³ Newspaper, television, radio and magazines would carry images of medical³Û
Û³ triumph supported not only by hard data but by living, walking, healthy ³Û
Û³ miracles. Imagine the impact this gift would have on millions of lives: ³Û
Û³ the fulfillment of dreams, the awakening of hope. Try to imagine that   ³Û
Û³ the announcement was made and the world slept through it. Try to picture³Û
Û³ a public reception with indifference and a medical society charged not  ³Û
Û³ to embrace but to destroy all embers of this success.                   ³Û
Û³ If the scenario is hard to picture, then don't try to imagine it but try³Û
Û³ to remember. It happened. I know. I developed the technology. I made the³Û
Û³ announcement.                                                           ³Û
Û³ I had always known that the medical system would take time to change, to³Û
Û³ develop, but I could not have believed that the public announcement     ³Û
Û³ would fall on the deaf ears of victims, nor that any of my peers would  ³Û
Û³ challenge me not on the science of my achievements but with baseless    ³Û
Û³ rumours, lies and personal attacks. I could never have anticipated that ³Û
Û³ in answering the dreams of so many, my life would turn into a nightmare.³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                        A THREAT TO THE STATUS QUO                       ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Summer of 1995 was the proudest in my life. Fifteen years of research   ³Û
Û³ and medical trials had been building up to this one moment: the         ³Û
Û³ triumphant return to my adopted homeland Australia, and the fulfillment ³Û
Û³ of a promise I had made to myself as I watched my father die of cancer  ³Û
Û³ so many years before.                                                   ³Û
Û³ Investigating three previously overlooked phenomena-organ resistance,   ³Û
Û³ organism resistance and spontaneous remission-I had developed effective ³Û
Û³ vaccines for the prevention and treatment of many killer diseases. The  ³Û
Û³ genesis of what I call..."Induced Remission Therapy"...had begun in     ³Û
Û³ Australia more than a decade earlier, but I had spent five years touring³Û
Û³ the world, lecturing and training doctors in hospitals and institutes. I³Û
Û³ was returning with independent proof: dramatic and overwhelming evidence³Û
Û³ that a new age of health was being ushered in. I was returning home to  ³Û
Û³ present my discoveries and to fund all research and development in this ³Û 
Û³ field.                                                                  ³Û
Û³ Armed with X-rays, blood tests, preliminary data from the Colorado      ³Û
Û³ University Medical School, UCLA, Cedars Sinai Medical Center and        ³Û
Û³ undoubtedly the strongest proof: patients in remission from cancer, AIDS³Û
Û³ and heart disease-rescued after all other options had been exhausted.   ³Û 
Û³ This should have been the realisation of my life's goals. Via the media,³Û
Û³ millions would meet the success stories and hear of my grant offer,     ³Û
Û³ $100,000 to initiate investigations in Australia of this new therapy.   ³Û
Û³ Then, suddenly, silence. All research institutes were eligible for the  ³Û
Û³ $100,000 grant, but none came.                                          ³Û
Û³ I found myself suddenly in the vacuum of a media blackout. Interviews   ³Û
Û³ were cancelled, news stories were not run. The public returned to its   ³Û
Û³ comfortable staple of cancer "breakthroughs" that may come to be in the ³Û
Û³ next 10 years, the weekly announcements from the familiar research      ³Û
Û³ institutes. Soon, to the public, I became a forgotten memory. To other  ³Û
Û³ interests, however, I was a threat that needed to be destroyed.         ³Û
Û³ A direct frontal assault on Australian soil was not the way, though. I  ³Û
Û³ am a medical doctor in Australia; that gives me certain powers and      ³Û
Û³ rights. I had offered money to have my therapies proved or disproved,   ³Û
Û³ and I had reached out to the public. Attacking me overtly would have    ³Û
Û³ raised too many questions. Backed by data from some of the world's most ³Û
Û³ prestigious research institutes, I was offering my technology with no   ³Û
Û³ strings attached.                                                       ³Û
Û³ Australian Medical Board representatives attempted to chastise me for   ³Û
Û³ what they believed were obvious lies and deception. They demanded to    ³Û
Û³ know who had evaluated my data and where. They accused me of falsely    ³Û
Û³ raising hope in poor, dying individuals. It seemed okay to announce that³Û
Û³ you can cure an occasional rat and raise millions in public donations if³Û
Û³ you are an institute; however, to say that you can help people and not  ³Û
Û³ ask for, but offer money to prove your point was not quite the done     ³Û
Û³ thing. Interestingly, the Medical Board enquiry into my "unprofessional"³Û
Û³ behaviour was the first time I had divulged details of the contacts and ³Û
Û³ institutes investigating my technology. Incredibly, within days, these  ³Û
Û³ centres would not only cancel their collaboration with me but also,     ³Û
Û³ paradoxically, begin to deny that one had ever existed.                 ³Û
Û³ In the USA and Mexico clinics opened up, offering my therapy but        ³Û
Û³ delivering heaven-knows-what to unsuspecting patients. I initiated legal³Û
Û³ action to shut them down, but then became a victim of intense personal  ³Û
Û³ and professional attacks as well as physical attempts on my life. I was ³Û
Û³ disgusted to learn that members of UCLA and Cedars Sinai took part in my³Û
Û³ denigration, but I was in for an even greater shock. When the names of  ³Û
Û³ individuals from the Australian Medical Board were used against me, I   ³Û
Û³ asked them to intervene; they would not. It seemed that my own Medical  ³Û
Û³ Board was supporting the attacks, even if only by inaction.             ³Û
Û³ What is even more incredible is that amongst all the lies were claims   ³Û
Û³ that my MB, BS (the Australian medical degree) was not that of a doctor ³Û
Û³ but rather of a nurse or undergraduate. In court, American expert       ³Û
Û³ witnesses testified to that and the Australian Medical Board seemed to  ³Û
Û³ go along for the ride. Despite incredible resistance and bias, I won the³Û
Û³ court battle-but the war to save lives still rages.                     ³Û
Û³ Unlike stories of conspiracies and cover-ups from long ago, this is     ³Û
Û³ happening now. I am still alive; the dream need not be lost, then       ³Û
Û³ mourned. The proof is there if you would only look.                     ³Û
Û³ I would never have imagined that the hardest part of healing cancer and ³Û
Û³ AIDS would be to get people to listen.                                  ³Û
Û³ This is my story and our dream. Please read; read and remember.         ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                             ACCELERATED DREAMS                          ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Every child has dreams and aspirations, major contributions to make,    ³Û
Û³ marks to be left, fame to be found-and what feels like an eternity in   ³Û
Û³ which to accomplish these objectives. Curing cancer, growing up to be a ³Û
Û³ hero, saving mankind-these must be some of the commonest fantasies of   ³Û
Û³ the young. Impossible tasks seem achievable because there is so much    ³Û
Û³ time-time to study, time to grow, time to prepare. Time allows for      ³Û
Û³ attainable fantasies, for pleasant dreams. When time is shortened by age³Û
Û³ or situation, when there is a need for rapid realisation of the dream,  ³Û
Û³ reality destroys fantasies and dreams are either abandoned or are often ³Û
Û³ transformed into tangible despair that mourns with its loss by cutting  ³Û
Û³ harsher than reality ever could.                                        ³Û
Û³ My father was first diagnosed with cancer in 1975. He was aware of the  ³Û
Û³ multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) several months prior to  ³Û
Û³ submitting to investigations and therapy. Multiple myeloma at the time  ³Û
Û³ was treated only when symptomatic, as therapy was felt to decrease      ³Û
Û³ lifespan, so he felt no rush to confirm his diagnosis.                  ³Û
Û³ He also felt no rush in informing me of his condition. My brother and   ³Û
Û³ sister had already entered medical school; I had entered puberty. My    ³Û
Û³ father worried that the news would devastate me and affect my studies.  ³Û
Û³ Even when faced with death, his concerns were for my life and future.   ³Û
Û³ So much changed in the next few years. My father, the workaholic, became³Û
Û³ much more the family man; always my hero, now my best friend.           ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                     STEPPING STONES, ALTERED PERCEPTION                 ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ Cancer is a disease that has repeatedly thwarted a cure. To defeat it,  ³Û
Û³ surely one did not simply need to understand current teachings, one     ³Û
Û³ needed to excel. Curing cancer, was not within current knowledge,       ³Û
Û³ therefore one needed not only to master existing technology but to      ³Û
Û³ surpass it.                                                             ³Û
Û³ When seen as stepping stones to achieving my dream, teachings were      ³Û
Û³ devoured. I top-marked in several exams and received the T. F. Ryan     ³Û
Û³ Roentgen Prize in physics. I tried to apply every new nugget of         ³Û
Û³ information to my father's situation. Biochemistry taught of new agents ³Û
Û³ that could increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and  ³Û
Û³ of cellular toxic agents that were presented in other contexts. Review  ³Û
Û³ of old and new medical research often showed that these agents had been ³Û
Û³ used, and failed to demonstrate efficacy. Chemical therapy of cancer was³Û
Û³ receiving such intense worldwide scrutiny that it was virtually         ³Û
Û³ impossible to generate an original thought or concept from within the   ³Û
Û³ field.                                                                  ³Û
Û³ Perhaps the answer then lay in the application of unrelated technology  ³Û
Û³ to the cancer problem. In physics we were taught that ultrasonic waves  ³Û
Û³ would have different heating coefficients depending on the density of   ³Û
Û³ the target; that is, the harder something was, the hotter it would      ³Û
Û³ become when exposed to ultrasonic frequencies. Cancer was usually denser³Û
Û³ than normal tissue, and my father's cancer, being surrounded by bone,   ³Û
Û³ could be heated up much more so than surrounding soft tissue. Perhaps   ³Û
Û³ such preferential heat damage could kill the cancer.                    ³Û
Û³ I approached several cancer researchers. They seemed as excited as I was³Û
Û³ but cautioned me to check past publications on the subject. Thirty years³Û
Û³ previously, someone had applied that effect to cancer with marginal and ³Û
Û³ occasionally harmful responses.                                         ³Û
Û³ Preferential attacks on cancer were not the answer, perhaps protection  ³Û
Û³ of normal structures against toxic agents would allow for more savage   ³Û
Û³ attacks against cancer. I discovered entire fields of science on the    ³Û
Û³ topic of radioprotective and chemoprotective agents. It was almost      ³Û
Û³ impossible to generate an original thought within the confines of       ³Û
Û³ chemotherapy and radiotherapy, yet despite continued failure these      ³Û
Û³ modalities seemed so powerful, alluring. Cancer was killing my father;  ³Û
Û³ I wanted to hit back, hard!                                             ³Û
Û³ Searching for metabolic weaknesses; poisoning some pathway essential to ³Û
Û³ cancer but not to normal cells; combining modalitie of chemotherapy with³Û
Û³ each other, with radiation, with hormones-everything had previously been³Û
Û³ done and had failed.                                                    ³Û
Û³ Cancer was seen as a disease of excess (too much smoking, radiation,    ³Û
Û³ pollution etc.); the generation of an evil, foreign life-form which     ³Û
Û³ battles and invariably destroys its host. Excess must be cut down, taken³Û
Û³ away, burned or poisoned. This logic, combined with the frustration and ³Û
Û³ hatred generated by this invulnerable nemesis, had locked us into the   ³Û
Û³ mindset that dominates current therapies-therapies that have failed us  ³Û
Û³ for so long, yet which we refuse to abandon.                            ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                          STANDARD CONCEPTS OF CANCER                    ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ I would like to outline the concepts that have dominated cancer research³Û
Û³ and therapies over the past few decades. Understanding failure is a     ³Û
Û³ useful tool in attaining success.                                       ³Û
Û³ By definition, cancer is a rogue cell which multiplies without respect  ³Û
Û³ for normal systems of cellular control and develops into a mass that    ³Û
Û³ invades and destroys normal tissue and structures. It is a powerful,    ³Û
Û³ mindless beast that spreads, grows more rapidly than normal tissue and  ³Û
Û³ ultimately leads to the death of the host.                              ³Û
Û³ Cancer growth rate may be slowed or accelerated by a mass variety of    ³Û
Û³ infections. Even in its natural history, cancer growth is not constant, ³Û 
Û³ for during the life of the patient the disease often grows in spurts. It³Û
Û³ is not uncommon for some cancer metastase to shrink, while most increase³Û
Û³ in size.                                                                ³Û
Û³ Cancer, the "mindless beast", starts in a localised area, invades       ³Û
Û³ circulatory and lymphatic systems, then spreads throughout the body.    ³Û
Û³ Certain cancers exhibit specific patterns of spread, long held by       ³Û
Û³ conventional teachings to be dictated by the pattern of circulatory     ³Û
Û³ distribution of micro-tumour emboli. This belief furthers the concept   ³Û
Û³ that cancer is a rampaging monster, cast by chance to spread its deadly ³Û
Û³ seeds. Passively carried by blood and lymph to their new targets, cancer³Û
Û³ cells are undifferentiated, nonspecific parcels of destruction that care³Û
Û³ not where they lodge and are not part of the decision-making process in ³Û
Û³ their travels to new organs.                                            ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                       SEARCHING FOR MISSING DEFENCES                    ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ A few observations regarding cancer, its population and age distribution³Û
Û³ are cited repeatedly in immunotherapy literature. Essentially, increased³Û
Û³ cancer incidence occurs with immunodeficiency and age, particularly past³Û
Û³ puberty, also appears to be a promoting factor.                         ³Û
Û³ If one considers only these observations, one can conclude that after   ³Û
Û³ puberty theres a loss of some vital immune-protective agent. If only we ³Û
Û³ could identify it and replenish it, perhaps we could then triumph over  ³Û
Û³ this living nightmare.                                                  ³Û
Û³ The most likely candidate for our source of white blood cells in shining³Û
Û³ armour seemed to be the thymus gland, a master immune- cell generator   ³Û
Û³ which atrophies by early teenage years. Its degeneration seemed to      ³Û
Û³ correlate with increased appearance of cancer.                          ³Û
Û³ Therapies have proliferated over the years where part or all of the     ³Û
Û³ thymus, its products and hormones were used to treat cancer patients.   ³Û
Û³ Results were marginal to non-existent, yet, of all the borderline       ³Û
Û³ alternative therapies, thymus supplementation persists most stubbornly. ³Û
Û³ Propelled by a romantic notion, hope does not fade-even when it is a    ³Û
Û³ false hope. This restricted logic may have been sound. Perhaps we had   ³Û
Û³ fixated on the wrong atrophied organ.                                   ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                              ORGAN RESISTANCE                           ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ A common observation, even in the most advanced of malignancies, is that³Û
Û³ some organs and tissues appear resistant to cancer spread and invasion. ³Û
Û³ The small intestine not only resist spread but also very rarely develops³Û
Û³ primary cancer. Perhaps there is specific immunologic capacity in the   ³Û
Û³ small intestine that prevents cancer from developing and protects it    ³Û
Û³ from tumour spread.                                                     ³Û
Û³ A quick search of anatomy and immunology books revealed that the small  ³Û
Û³ intestine is blessed with its own immune protection in the form of      ³Û
Û³ lymphoid aggregates called "Peyer's patches". Much of the function of   ³Û
Û³ this line of defence is restricted to the small intestine and does not  ³Û
Û³ circulate. This could account for the cancer resistance being local.    ³Û
Û³ Studies of lower animals, particularly birds, indicated that their main ³Û
Û³ immune-processing organ was not the thymus but was located in their     ³Û
Û³ embryonic and foetal intestine. Could this part of human immunology have³Û
Û³ been delegated an unfairly low status? In the animals, their capacity to³Û
Û³ transfer immune resistance to the entire body is optimal early in life. ³Û
Û³ What if human correlation exists whereby there is transfer of resistant ³Û
Û³ factors between Peyer's patches (and immune responses localised to the  ³Û
Û³ small intestine in later life) and the rest of the body early in life?  ³Û
Û³ In view of the logic supporting thymic supplementation and the hope that³Û
Û³ restoration of an atrophied organ would destroy disease, there was      ³Û
Û³ another interesting observation with relation to Peyer's patches.       ³Û
Û³ Intestinal lymphoid aggregates atrophied with age. We had been so       ³Û
Û³ obsessed with the thymus that perhaps we overlooked the real saviour.   ³Û 
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                             THOUGHT TO ACTION                           ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ I had yet to start medical school but spent a good deal of time at the  ³Û
Û³ Peter McCallum Cancer Institute in Melbourne where my father was        ³Û
Û³ receiving treatment. He had introduced me to several oncologists and I  ³Û
Û³ approached them with my ideas. The general response was condescending   ³Û
Û³ but usually polite. Dr Ian Cooper, chief haematologist, was not only    ³Û
Û³ supportive but also advised me to formulate my ideas as an experimental ³Û
Û³ protocol and present it to Dr Jose of the Immunology Department.        ³Û
Û³ The reply to my preliminary correspondence was surprisingly encouraging:³Û
Û³ I was invited to address the weekly group meeting of the immunology     ³Û
Û³ research team. I prepared theory, protocol and an experimental design.  ³Û
Û³ The presentation was informal and pleasant. Researchers from around the ³Û
Û³ world had submitted protocols for review by this unit. Immunostimulants,³Û
Û³ interferon, interleukin, lymphocyte harvest pre-chemotherapy: the       ³Û
Û³ suggestions were complicated but the themes familiar. I had heard or    ³Û
Û³ read about all these concepts before; worse yet, the experiments had    ³Û
Û³ been done and repeated years previously. I felt encouraged; my protocol ³Û
Û³ was the only original idea being presented on that day. Surely a new    ³Û
Û³ concept would be more appealing to a research unit on the cutting edge  ³Û
Û³ of technology than simple repetition of prior failures?                 ³Û
Û³ To demonstrate that Peyer's patches could be stimulated to produce anti-³Û
Û³ cancer activity, I proposed that lymphocytes isolated from these        ³Û
Û³ aggregates be tested against those taken from the spleen and other      ³Û
Û³ sources for efficacy against cancer. For obvious reasons I chose        ³Û
Û³ multiple myeloma as the cancer system to attack. An important design    ³Û
Û³ feature was the testing of ordinary extracts to check for inherent      ³Û
Û³ activity and the evaluation of lymphocytes exposed to the cancer during ³Û
Û³ the animal's life to search for induced activity.                       ³Û
Û³ I was aware that the members of the unit had not been previously exposed³Û
Û³ to this approach; it was new to them. I was also aware that they were   ³Û
Û³ not in the least interested.                                            ³Û
Û³ The first question I was asked was by Dr Jose, requesting the sources   ³Û
Û³ and literature supporting this concept as well as data on previous      ³Û
Û³ trials and their conclusions on this issue.                             ³Û
Û³ "This experiment hasn't been done before!" I claimed proudly.           ³Û
Û³ "But we need to see prior work in this field," he countered. "That is a ³Û
Û³  key factor in our accepting experimental protocols!"                   ³Û
Û³ In that instant, I understood an intrinsic flaw in the cancer research  ³Û
Û³ industry. In order to realise easy acceptance of ideas and receive      ³Û
Û³ grants, it was important to show that you were travelling down the same ³Û
Û³ well-worn path of prior investigations.                                 ³Û
Û³ "I don't understand," I replied. "Are you telling me that you won't do  ³Û
Û³ this because it hasn't been done before?"                               ³Û
Û³ "It is hard for me to allocate funds to work lacking prior experimental ³Û
Û³ and data references." (In essence, he meant "yes".)                     ³Û
Û³ "We have no cure for cancer; we aren't even close. How will we find it  ³Û
Û³ if we don't explore new avenues?" I did not mean to sound cocky, but all³Û
Û³ of my hope and courage were suddenly dissipating. I was being rejected. ³Û
Û³ "We are on a strict budget and have defined guidelines."                ³Û
Û³ I would not be dismissed; my chance to save my father demanded their    ³Û
Û³ acceptance.                                                             ³Û
Û³ "Okay, I'll pay for it!" (The first of many times that this phrase would³Û
Û³ pass my lips, and about the only time that I would not regret it.)      ³Û
Û³ Dr Jose smiled and relented. "We'll see," he said. "Go do an intensive  ³Û
Û³ literature search; we'll start arranging things next week. Your ideas   ³Û
Û³ are interesting and worth exploring."                                   ³Û
Û³ My father, Isaac, was by now confined to a wheelchair and my mother,    ³Û
Û³ Catherine, catered to his every need and whim. He had been a whirlwind, ³Û
Û³ an active workaholic who delighted in helping the ill. Now confined to  ³Û
Û³ a chair and to bed, he exhibited a spirit and attitude that I have since³Û
Û³ come to realise is far from common. Isaac wasted no time cursing his    ³Û
Û³ debility but would focus on how long he was able to stay in his garden, ³Û
Û³ tending to his plants, or on how active and pain-free he could be on a  ³Û
Û³ particular day.                                                         ³Û
Û³ That day, my father and mother awaited my return from the conference    ³Û
Û³ with anticipation. That night, my home was filled with intense happiness³Û
Û³ hope and prayer.                                                        ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                               SIMPLE MIRACLES                           ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The experiment I had proposed was amateurish in its simplicity. The     ³Û
Û³ small intestine dealt with foreign challenges from ingested food on a   ³Û
Û³ continuous basis. Mechanisms for immunologically dealing with harmful   ³Û
Û³ agents had to be dramatic, rapid and effective. Every time an organism  ³Û
Û³ entered our intestine, we did not have the luxury of mounting a slow    ³Û
Û³ response with temperature, lethargy and all the normal physiologic and  ³Û
Û³ metabolic features of an immune response. It had to be eliminated with  ³Û
Û³ prejudice and finality.                                                 ³Û
Û³ Neighbourhood lymphocytes in the blood and other organs would never meet³Û
Û³ such overwhelming numbers of challenges, as several barriers needed to  ³Û
Û³ be passed first.... their response therefore could afford to be more    ³Û
Û³ delayed. Immune cells from respiratory passages would also be expected  ³Û
Û³ to act rapidly, but they did not appear resistant to the spread and     ³Û
Û³ appearance of cancer. Peyer's patches would protect the small intestine ³Û
Û³ against direct invasion from the large bowel cancers as well as blood-  ³Û
Û³ borne metastases. I reasoned that their cancer-killing ability should   ³Û
Û³ be visible within minutes.                                              ³Û 
Û³ Others in the laboratory were sceptical, and with reason. Data repeated ³Û
Û³ from decades of studies indicated that it would take the incubation of  ³Û
Û³ 50,000 to 100,000 white blood cells for three days with cancer cells    ³Û
Û³ and immunostimulants for some of these cells to kill one cancer cell.   ³Û
Û³ The effect was often so subtle that radio-uptake and leakage studies    ³Û
Û³ had to be undertaken to detect differences. This involved incubating    ³Û
Û³ cancer cells with radioactive isotopes of an agent such as caesium, to  ³Û
Û³ allow the cancer cells to absorb it. When damaged, cancer cells would   ³Û
Û³ then leak the radioactive caesium and that leakage can be measured to   ³Û
Û³ indicate cell damage. I reasoned that the effect would be easily seen   ³Û
Û³ on light microscopy with oesin uptake. This technique is one where a    ³Û
Û³ red dye is added to the cells. Living cells have an active pump system  ³Û
Û³ and patent membranes that stop dye entry, whereas damaged and dying     ³Û
Û³ cells would be coloured by the oesin.                                   ³Û
Û³ Control studies using cells from Peyer's patches that had not been      ³Û
Û³ exposed to cancer, showed cancer viability close to 95 per cent. Spleen ³Û
Û³ cells from unexposed animals did the same. Spleen cells from animals    ³Û
Û³ that had been carrying the cancer gave me a surprising finding of 100   ³Û
Û³ per cent viability of cancer and an actual increase in cancer count     ³Û
Û³ after short-term incubation. It appeared that spleen extract from a     ³Û
Û³ diseased animal was actually promoting tumour growth. I did not pay much³Û
Û³ attention to that finding at the time; I was searching for a cure, not  ³Û
Û³ riddles.                                                                ³Û
Û³ Cells from Peyer's patches of mice that had been carrying the cancer    ³Û
Û³ surpassed my expectations. As opposed to the 50,000 to 100,000 cells    ³Û
Û³ destroying one cancer cell as previously mentioned over a three-day     ³Û
Û³ period, it took one lymphocyte from sensitised aggregates to kill 400   ³Û
Û³ cancer cells in a one-hour-or-less time period. The cancer cells would  ³Û
Û³ uptake the red oesin dye and soon collapse.                             ³Û
Û³ The experiment would be repeated over and over before I would let myself³Û
Û³ believe it, before I would show others. Exposed to a very small amount  ³Û
Û³ of Peyer's patch extracts, the cancer cells would turn red with         ³Û
Û³ embarrassment, then shrivel and die. Mass slaughter of an invulnerable  ³Û
Û³ enemy-it was intoxicating and delicious.                                ³Û
Û³ I beckoned for Dr Jose to review the carnage. With just a hint of       ³Û
Û³ excitement he exclaimed, "They're all dead!" He then added in standard  ³Û
Û³ clinical "Vulcan" coldness: "Interesting."                              ³Û
Û³ The following weeks were filled with more magic. Tests confirmed no     ³Û
Û³ toxicity to healthy cells from my lymphocyte extracts. They were able to³Û
Û³ protect animals against cancer inoculations, and single low-dose        ³Û
Û³ treatment was able to keep the animals living longer once they had the  ³Û
Û³ disease. Other cancer systems were tested, including the hepatoma rat   ³Û
Û³ model, with identical successes.                                        ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                             FADING DREAMS                               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ I asked when this discovery could be put to use in terminally-ill       ³Û
Û³ humans. "Not for a long, long time," I was told condescendingly.        ³Û
Û³ None of my colleagues or superiors in the laboratory seemed to share my ³Û
Û³ excitement; worse yet, they seemed to resent my success-and me, too, for³Û
Û³ that matter. Perhaps their egos were bruised. I was often reminded that ³Û
Û³ I had no formal training or education in the field, whereas they had    ³Û
Û³ Hospital) and the Ludwig Institute became more and more isolated.       ³Û
Û³ Other affiliates and collaborators who had donated animals and lab space³Û
Û³ to me included the Department of Biochemistry at Melbourne University.  ³Û
Û³ Dr Schreiber, the department head, called me in to advise me personally ³Û
Û³ that in the few days I had been there I had created friction as I was   ³Û
Û³ not qualified, paid or a member of their 'group' and that structurally  ³Û
Û³ they could not support another worker. I had not fought with anybody,   ³Û
Û³ or argued or insulted anyone. I was unpaid and, above all, my work was  ³Û
Û³ yielding incredible results. How could they terminate investigation on  ³Û
Û³ such a promising avenue? These extracts were killing cancer more        ³Û
Û³ effectively and more safely than anything else in history! "It doesn't  ³Û
Û³ matter," Dr Schreiber replied.                                          ³Û
Û³ Dr Jose reminded me that publication was the only way for a scientist   ³Û
Û³ to achieve recognition, and offered me a poster presentation at the     ³Û
Û³ Clinical Oncology Society of Australia (COSA) annual meeting in 1981.   ³Û
Û³ Hopes rekindled; I prepared for the big time. Perhaps amongst doctors,  ³Û
Û³ the idea of an effective therapy would be better received than in the   ³Û
Û³ sterile field of research.                                              ³Û
Û³ A few months later I was standing proudly by my poster; the youngest-   ³Û
Û³ ever presenter of an original project at the prestigious COSA meeting.  ³Û
Û³ Few people stopped by my exhibit and most did so only to advise me to   ³Û
Û³ leave research and concentrate on my medical studies. I was simply too  ³Û
Û³ young and naïve, they said. "What about the work?" I asked. "Interesting³Û
Û³ ," they replied, and moved on.                                          ³Û
Û³ Most people spent their time around a diagnostic antibody exhibit. The  ³Û
Û³ attractive researcher's mini-skirt and plunging neckline were also on   ³Û
Û³ exhibit. Hell, even I found myself distracted by her monoclonals!       ³Û
Û³ I had come with aspirations of recognition, of encountering someone who ³Û
Û³ would carry the investigation where I could not: in the human field. If ³Û
Û³ I had harboured any illusions of discovery, fame or acceptance, they    ³Û
Û³ were quickly shattered. Scientists and doctors alike had greeted me and ³Û
Û³ my discoveries with the same warmth one reserves for an acute attack of ³Û
Û³ haemorrhoids or outbreak of herpes.                                     ³Û
Û³ While I found the displays worthwhile, the conferences themselves were  ³Û
Û³ electrifying. I learned of new techniques being used and the latest     ³Û
Û³ trials of hormonal agents, immunostimulants and chemotherapy.           ³Û
Û³ Immunotherapy remained an exciting field, whereas the latest            ³Û
Û³ chemotherapy evaluations were delivered in gritty, realistic and        ³Û
Û³ defeatist manner. Hormones were finding increasing application in       ³Û
Û³ general disease management. Bone damage and pain in cancer such as      ³Û
Û³ multiple myeloma were shown to be preventable and treatable with        ³Û
Û³ anabolic hormones. Just that tidbit of information was worthwhile. It   ³Û
Û³ represented a concrete, usable way to help my father.                   ³Û
Û³ During the presentations I was to strike a friendship with an oncologist³Û
Û³ who would later do his best to destroy me. It would be a recurring theme³Û
Û³ of my life. My greatest enemies would always start as respected friends.³Û
Û³ When I suggested to my father's oncologist that anabolic hormones be    ³Û
Û³ added to strengthen his bones and diminish his pain, he became annoyed. ³Û
Û³ I had stepped on his toes by daring to suggest a therapy. Had I hurt his³Û
Û³ ego? Was there a better way to ask him? Who cares? I just wanted the    ³Û
Û³ best for my father. He refused to recommend it and my father refused to ³Û
Û³ try anything his specialist did not recommend.                          ³Û
Û³ In one presentation I managed to offend my father's doctor and be       ³Û
Û³ ignored by virtually all others. I had presented a technology for curing³Û
Û³ cancer, and no one cared.                                               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                       EGOS AND LIES IN THE HEALING ARTS                 ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ One of modern medicine's greatest achievements is the claim that no one ³Û
Û³ needs to suffer, for there is supposedly no pain that cannot be elimin- ³Û
Û³ ated by modern pharmaceuticals. That is perhaps true even in severe     ³Û
Û³ terminal pain, if one does not mind existing instead of living; existing³Û
Û³ with clouded perceptions, blunted emotions, a drug-induced stupor; a    ³Û
Û³ waking coma where you struggle to comprehend the world racing around    ³Û
Û³ you, where you try to communicate but mouth gibberish, where you dig    ³Û
Û³ deep, searching for the spark, the joy, the will to continue but find   ³Û
Û³ not even a memory of it.                                                ³Û
Û³ This desperation, this depression, this torment, this torture is often  ³Û
Û³ the price paid for physical comfort. "We can prevent suffering in       ³Û
Û³ terminal disease" is a statement often made by a medical fool more      ³Û
Û³ concerned with perpetuating and reaffirming his illusions of godhood    ³Û
Û³ without any regard for reality.                                         ³Û
Û³ Cancer is nothing if not relentless. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy had  ³Û
Û³ failed to arrest the progress of my father's disease. As the multiple   ³Û
Û³ myeloma spread its physical domination, shattered my father's skeleton  ³Û
Û³ and destroyed his immune function, fractures, recurrent infections and  ³Û
Û³ pain, constant pain, became features of his life. As he lay bedridden   ³Û
Û³ with bone compression, multiple rib breaks and a disintegrating pelvis, ³Û
Û³ my father refused painkillers except at night so that he could sleep.   ³Û
Û³ He would not permit any loss of mental clarity during his waking hours: ³Û
Û³ time was short and he wanted to live it, experience it fully. With his  ³Û
Û³ body deteriorating, his mind remained the only undesecrated sanctuary,  ³Û
Û³ haven, drive to continue. He would not allow this most cherished        ³Û
Û³ possession to be tainted; he would not allow his loved ones to see him  ³Û
Û³ as anything less than the best he could be.                             ³Û
Û³ I was beginning to have major problems at medical school. I could not   ³Û
Û³ see the relevance of many topics, nor fathom the time-wasting techniques³Û
Û³ in teaching other subjects. We learned, for example, how to launch a    ³Û
Û³ projectile into orbit around Jupiter (useful knowledge if your practice ³Û
Û³ caters for outer-space aliens and you wish to post them a prescription; ³Û
Û³ of course that would necessitate a pharmacy on Uranus, which could prove³Û
Û³ uncomfortable). Plutonium purification in the manufacture of nuclear    ³Û
Û³ warheads was another priceless inclusion in our study of the healing    ³Û
Û³ arts. Important topics were noted by their absence. Preventive medicine ³Û
Û³ was never discussed. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when I undertook³Û
Û³ my formal medical studies-diet and nutrition were considered alternative³Û
Û³ heresy.                                                                 ³Û
Û³ The study of anatomy was done in a particularly inefficient manner. We  ³Û
Û³ were given cadavers to dissect for two years. A group of eight students ³Û
Û³ would spend hours, scalpels in hand, digging at a corpse, hoping to find³Û
Û³ and trace nerves and arteries to their origins and distributions. Dead  ³Û
Û³ bodies do not handle the same as living tissue, and rarely look the same³Û
Û³ as in book illustrations. I studied my anatomy from a book. Much more   ³Û
Û³ could have been learned had each group been assigned one person who was ³Û
Û³ well-trained and who could have guided and educated us. My memories of  ³Û
Û³ these sessions are ones of the stench of formalin, of a student eating  ³Û
Û³ someone's biceps on a dare, and of others skipping rope using a corpse's³Û
Û³ small intestine or playing football with a hardened lung. This abhorrent³Û
Û³ lack of respect for men and women who had donated their bodies to       ³Û
Û³ science and medicine sickened me.                                       ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                 MEDICAL RESEARCH: STAGNANT, DIRECTIONLESS               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ In this era of genetic engineering and daily promises of medical marvels³Û
Û³ it is hard to imagine a period where innovative thought seemed to be at ³Û
Û³ a standstill; yet back then, as now, in the playing fields of clinical  ³Û
Û³ trials, one finds some variations of intricate protocols and slight     ³Û
Û³ modifications of some rules and tools to search for slightly improved   ³Û
Û³ responses from the same tired players: surgery, radiation and           ³Û
Û³ chemotherapy. This points to the stagnant nature of real options        ³Û
Û³ available to the public.                                                ³Û
Û³ As a medical student, I was now becoming exposed to rigid, inhumane     ³Û
Û³ insanity often associated with clinical trials and questionable measures³Û
Û³ of success. Only in cancer, for example, would a chemotherapeutic agent ³Û
Û³ being evaluated be considered a success if it shrank a cancer mass, even³Û
Û³ if it shortened patient survival.                                       ³Û
Û³ Decades ago hospitals had carried out unethical and repulsive procedures³Û
Û³ in the name of science. Pregnant women were injected with high doses of ³Û
Û³ radioactive isotopes to gauge the effect on embryos; prisoners'         ³Û
Û³ testicles were irradiated to study changes; relatives were inoculated   ³Û
Û³ with patients' cancers to study their response (at least one case of    ³Û
Û³ cancer transfer and death of a patient's mother occurred).              ³Û
Û³ Modern-day inhumanity was present, but not quite as overt. It lay in    ³Û
Û³ protocol objectives and structures.                                     ³Û
Û³ I remember the case of a patient, a 22-year-old mother, who entered a   ³Û
Û³ monitored trial situation where she was slotted into the hormone-blocker³Û
Û³ evaluation group. This breast cancer study was designed to evaluate     ³Û
Û³ survival with various treatment options: surgery alone (localised),     ³Û
Û³ surgery alone (extensive), with radiation, with chemotherapy, with      ³Û
Û³ hormonal blocker therapy, with combinations of the preceding.           ³Û
Û³ This data had already been gathered to reasonable precision from studies³Û
Û³ too numerous to mention worldwide, and with certain guidelines for      ³Û
Û³ combinations had been enforced for many years. This particular design   ³Û
Û³ protocol did not allow for such flexibility. How could we achieve       ³Û
Û³ accurate readings if we contaminated one group with the therapy of      ³Û
Û³ another group?                                                          ³Û
Û³ The cruelty of the last statement could be seen in the plight of the    ³Û
Û³ patient referred to above. Having been assigned to the hormone group,   ³Û
Û³ other therapy was withheld-even when it became obvious that it was not  ³Û
Û³ working, and spreading cancer had broken several bones in her spine.    ³Û
Û³ (This was not an unusual occurrence in breast cancer. The standard      ³Û
Û³ therapy of the time, which remains to this day, is the use of radiation ³Û
Û³ to allow for fracture-healing and to resolve the associated pain. This  ³Û
Û³ was denied her; actually, never offered, for the 'sake' of the trial.)  ³Û
Û³ The insanity of this situation must be restated: this trial was         ³Û
Û³ confirming many others which had already outlined the relative merits   ³Û
Û³ of therapy. Why this theme of repetitive rediscovery of the known,      ³Û
Û³ regardless of human consequence? Because it gives the illusion of work, ³Û
Û³ progress and motion in a stagnant cesspit of medical impotence.         ³Û
Û³ In Australia, the natural health revolution had only just begun and was ³Û
Û³ struggling for acceptance. The adamant claims of this new field of      ³Û
Û³ medicine were both inspiring and confusing. The response from all the   ³Û
Û³ conventional medicine was cutting. Alternative medicine was deemed      ³Û
Û³ fraudulent and rejected outright, its practitioners shunned and         ³Û
Û³ persecuted. Disgrace and deregistration awaited doctors who preached or ³Û
Û³ practised its beliefs.                                                  ³Û
Û³ Supporters of this emerging field dealt in an inexact science, yet the  ³Û
Û³ detractors refused to carry out investigations to disprove the claims   ³Û
Û³ of alternative medicine. What resulted was a slinging match with a      ³Û
Û³ confused public as the victim. Patients were often punished if they saw ³Û
Û³ a naturopath or asked a doctor advice on supplements; they would be     ³Û
Û³ treated curtly, and it was not unusual for the doctor to refuse their   ³Û
Û³ ongoing care. New options had been thrust onto patients, yet proof of   ³Û
Û³ efficacy was as lacking as proof of inefficacy.                         ³Û
Û³ My mother and I had been searching constantly for anything in research, ³Û
Û³ folklore or overseas programs. The sudden influx of claims from natural ³Û
Û³ medicine brought a range of new modalities to try: mind power, herbs,   ³Û
Û³ vitamins, vegetarianism, macrobiotics. My father tried them all, to no  ³Û 
Û³ avail.                                                                  ³Û
Û³ Fasting, juices, meditation, simple do-it-yourself techniques with a    ³Û
Û³ universal appeal could restore a person's capacity to help themselves   ³Û
Û³ against a condition so foreign, so overwhelming that grown adults would ³Û
Û³ revert to child-like dependency on their doctors. Even if only of       ³Û
Û³ marginal efficacy in the physical long-run, the psychological advantage ³Û
Û³ of regaining some measure of control of one's life was a feature        ³Û
Û³ conventional medicine could not compete with. There was also a link that³Û
Û³ had only been hinted at previously. Alternative medicine heavily        ³Û
Û³ promoted the concept that proper activation of immune function could    ³Û
Û³ eliminate cancer-again, an empowering concept.                          ³Û
Û³ Perhaps in an effort to compete with the new challenger, or perhaps     ³Û
Û³ finally disgusted with the toxic failures called "standard therapy",    ³Û
Û³ the powers-that-be launched a major thrust into immunotherapy. I was    ³Û
Û³ part of the "IF" generation. Conventional medicine brought out a new    ³Û
Û³ warrior, an immunostimulant called "interferon"-the "IF" drug. I cannot ³Û
Û³ claim to know or understand what changes the emphasis of investigative  ³Û
Û³ pathways in modern medicine, only to say that the industry is           ³Û
Û³ particularly well tuned to public views and needs. In the 1970s it was  ³Û
Û³ immune function, so interferon and interleukin occupied the forefront   ³Û
Û³ of research for a decade or so. In the 1980s the public cried out for   ³Û
Û³ natural medicine, so Taxol, a natural extract, was released.            ³Û
Û³ If the above passage alluded to a sinister, manipulative arm to the     ³Û
Û³ industry, it is because I believe it to be inherent in this field.      ³Û
Û³ Interferon, hailed as the new champion in the 1970s, had actually been  ³Û
Û³ discovered at least 50 years previously and then shelved. Why turn to   ³Û
Û³ it now unless the above were true? Public manipulation and public       ³Û
Û³ gullibility are extreme in many areas; cancer, however, leads the       ³Û
Û³ field.                                                                  ³Û
Û³                               STOLEN HOPE                               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ The interferon onslaught was savage. Newspapers, magazines, television  ³Û
Û³ and radio programs were at saturation levels with details of miraculous ³Û
Û³ cures. Like a well-oiled machine, the Cancer Institute announced it     ³Û
Û³ would commence interferon trials; then... soon after... hospital        ³Û
Û³ fundraising events were commenced. This '''dance''' of announcing       ³Û
Û³ breakthroughs, then a program for implementation followed by appeals    ³Û
Û³ for public donation, was monotonous and obvious, year after year.       ³Û
Û³ Many controversial figures have been accused of preying on desperate    ³Û
Û³ victims and profiting from false hope. With decades of failure behind   ³Û
Û³ them but excellent marketing and publicity, with daily announcements of ³Û
Û³ breakthroughs and assurances of imminent success, with billions raised  ³Û
Û³ within this format, could the cancer industry not also be accused of the³Û
Û³ same? Yesterday's heroes fade into oblivion and new hopeful contenders  ³Û
Û³ are found to blaze in glory for a time, then fail. They may fail in     ³Û
Û³ living up to therapeutic expectation but always succeed in maintaining  ³Û
Û³ the illusion of dynamic progress and in raising phenomenal income.      ³Û
Û³ Interferon was showing initial remarkable activity in several cancer    ³Û
Û³ types; most importantly, and repeatedly, cases of advanced multiple     ³Û
Û³ myeloma were shown recovering with this new therapy. My father's        ³Û
Û³ hospital had announced that it would investigate its efficacy in the    ³Û
Û³ treatment of multiple myeloma. A dream come true, a hope reignited!     ³Û
Û³ Institute and was on first-name basis with most of the specialists      ³Û
Û³ there. He was also one of few long-term survivors of multiple myeloma   ³Û
Û³ at that hospital, so surely he would be one of those enrolled in the    ³Û
Û³ trial now that all other therapies were failing him.                    ³Û
Û³ Reality hardly ever fulfils all your dreams and prayers. It is also not ³Û
Û³ usually as needlessly cruel as it was to my father. Following months of ³Û
Û³ anticipation and planning into what had seemed a bleak future, we       ³Û
Û³ awaited notification of the interferon trial. My father was not         ³Û
Û³ accepted.                                                               ³Û
Û³ In medical trials, patient selection is very often optimised for        ³Û
Û³ demonstrating good results. The healthier the patient, the more likely  ³Û
Û³ they are to survive the trial (no point investing in someone who may    ³Û
Û³ die prior to accumulation of data), and the more likely they are to make³Û
Û³ the product look good. My father was a risk. Death loomed closer; cancer³Û
Û³ laughed and marched on, its progress accelerated by a weary body and    ³Û
Û³ a spirit shattered not by disease but by hope that was taken away.      ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                             Part II-Lecture                             ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ My name is Sam Chachoua and I'm an MD from Melbourne, Australia. What   ³Û
Û³ I'm going to talk to you about now is something quite new and           ³Û
Û³ revolutionary. It's called Induced Remission Therapy and it's a         ³Û
Û³ treatment that is based on three natural phenomena: organ resistance,   ³Û
Û³ organism resistance, and spontaneous remission.                         ³Û
Û³ I first got into cancer research at an early age when my father was     ³Û
Û³ diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and I basically tried to see whether   ³Û
Û³ I could find something that could help him where conventional therapies ³Û
Û³ were failing. One thing that I noted in all the studies I had was that  ³Û
Û³ there are parts of the human body-for example, the small intestine-which³Û
Û³ are consistently resistant to cancer. Regardless of how far and wide    ³Û
Û³ cancer usually spreads, it usually leaves the small intestine alone.    ³Û
Û³ There's also something known as "organism resistance", which means that ³Û
Û³ most other animals that we try to give human cancer to are able to      ³Û
Û³ reject it. So I set about designing an experimental protocol where I was³Û
Û³ going to find out what it was about the small intestine that made it    ³Û
Û³ resistant to cancer, and I was going to find out what it was about      ³Û
Û³ horses, cats and dogs and other animals that made them resistant to     ³Û
Û³ human cancer.                                                           ³Û
Û³ To cut a long story short, I managed to isolate the immunological       ³Û
Û³ factors which I used in experimental protocols at the Peter McCallum    ³Û
Û³ Cancer Institute. At age 18 I'd written my first paper, and the         ³Û
Û³ following year I presented it before the Clinical Oncology Society of   ³Û
Û³ Australia. Let me tell you, I was pretty proud of myself. I thought:    ³Û
Û³ "Kid, you've got it made; you've helped your dad now, and this therapy  ³Û
Û³ is going to be adopted soon." And I could just see it. I was going to   ³Û
Û³ walk into the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia. Everybody's going ³Û
Û³ to cheer and get on the phone and say: "Hey, we've got a young kid here;³Û
Û³ give me the Nobel Committee." Naïve! I was actually greeted with all the³Û
Û³ warmth one usually reserves for a venereal disease or an acute attack of³Û
Û³ haemorrhoids!                                                           ³Û
Û³ Let me just jump to how this form of therapy can apply to AIDS. We've   ³Û
Û³ known for a very long time that it's impossible to give animals AIDS by ³Û
Û³ injecting them with HIV. Now there are two possibilities: either animals³Û
Û³ are inherently resistant, i.e., they don't have receptor sites for HIV; ³Û
Û³ or maybe, just maybe, they have an immune system which is capable of    ³Û
Û³ fighting and destroying the virus. Well, hey, let's check it out!       ³Û
Û³ So the initial data all showed promise that you could raise an immune   ³Û
Û³ response out of a horse, for example, that would selectively destroy    ³Û
Û³ HIV. What intrigued and amazed me was seeing the thought processes or,  ³Û
Û³ rather, not being able to see the thought processes in the AIDS         ³Û
Û³ researchers who for years now have tried to find some way of developing ³Û
Û³ an immune system resistant to AIDS. They sit there and say: "Well, we   ³Û
Û³ need to make an animal model. Once we have an animal model, once we've  ³Û
Û³ made an animal sick with AIDS we can find a way to cure it." So they get³Û
Û³ their little test animals; they get their rats, their dogs, their horses³Û
Û³ and cats; they inject them with HIV-and they can't give them AIDS! They ³Û
Û³ get really upset about that: "How am I supposed to find a cure for AIDS ³Û
Û³ if I can't give this animal AIDS? I'm injecting it with HIV to try to   ³Û
Û³ find an immune response that will kill HIV, and it won't take it. How   ³Û
Û³ am I supposed to do my job?" Are you following the thought pattern      ³Û
Û³ here? It's looking right at them.                                       ³Û
Û³ It would seem a bit of an anticlimax if I were to tell you that one of  ³Û
Û³ the easiest ways to deal with the greatest plague today is to use an    ³Û
Û³ animal system that's resistant to the plague, and treat and cure the    ³Û
Û³ people suffering from the disease. A hundred years ago, before we had   ³Û
Û³ antibiotics, the only therapy we had for pneumonia, smallpox and polio  ³Û
Û³ was horse serum. They'd get a horse, shoot it with a disease, draw the  ³Û
Û³ horse serum out, shoot that into the person and cure them. If that      ³Û
Û³ therapy was good enough to deal with the plagues a hundred years ago,   ³Û
Û³ why isn't it being applied now?                                         ³Û
Û³ But what happens if you do apply it now? Here's the case of a young man ³Û
Û³ with AIDS. He's 32 years old. He's got a pneumocystis pneumonia, he's   ³Û
Û³ short of breath, he's got a T-cell count of 80 and a T4/T8 imbalance.   ³Û
Û³ So, essentially, his blood, his virus, is extracted out; an animal, such³Û
Û³ as a horse, is vaccinated with his blood; the antiserum from the animal ³Û
Û³ is then purified against this patient's blood so it doesn't cause       ³Û
Û³ allergic reactions; and the patient is treated with the horse's serum.  ³Û
Û³ And we see that within 24 hours, the pneumocystis pneumonia clears up.  ³Û
Û³ That's pretty remarkable considering that the best that antibiotics can ³Û
Û³ do, if they can clear it, is take days to weeks. This patient's symptoms³Û
Û³ resolved; his T-cell count went up to 780 within 10 days from a low of  ³Û
Û³ 80, and his T4/T8 ratio became normal.                                  ³Û
Û³ Now what I've just told you is pretty dramatic, but doesn't it make some³Û
Û³ sense to you? Isn't it common sense? We have a disease that can ravage  ³Û
Û³ our immune systems but can't ravage a horse's, can't ravage another     ³Û
Û³ disease?                                                                ³Û
Û³ So, off I went to the big hospitals in the US, and I said, "Hey, guys,  ³Û
Û³ look at this!" I showed them the case study and the patient I brought   ³Û
Û³ with me. I showed them 'befores' and 'afters' which were done on US     ³Û
Û³ soil, and they said: "Inject a person with horse serum? Are you insane? ³Û
Û³ We'd never do that."                                                    ³Û
Û³ A few months later, some of the people whom I was speaking to from a    ³Û
Û³ related centre-friends of theirs, actually-came out with the            ³Û
Û³ announcement that they're going to give a baboon's bone marrow to an    ³Û
Û³ AIDS patient because baboons are resistant to HIV!                      ³Û
Û³ At that stage, feeling dejected and rather silly, I set about trying to ³Û
Û³ investigate as much in the way of alternative therapy and conventional  ³Û
Û³ therapy as I could-and believe me, I investigated just about everything,³Û
Û³ down to laughter therapy!                                               ³Û
Û³ Now one thing that really struck me very quickly on in the piece when I ³Û
Û³ was reviewing all the alternative, natural and conventional therapies   ³Û
Û³ is that there are two misnomers that exist in this world. One of them   ³Û
Û³ is "natural therapy".                                                   ³Û
Û³ Please, don't take me the wrong way. There's a lot of good in           ³Û
Û³ alternative therapy, there's a lot of good in vitamins and diet, but    ³Û
Û³ what on Earth is natural about shoving 50,000 units of vitamin C        ³Û
Û³ intravenously? What's natural about injecting ozone into somebody's     ³Û
Û³ backside? What's natural about cappuccino enemas?                       ³Û
Û³ The other great misnomer in the medical field of conventional therapy   ³Û
Û³ are the terms "radiotherapy" and "chemotherapy". How the world "chemo"  ³Û
Û³ ever got side by side with the word "therapy" is beyond me. Never before³Û
Û³ has a therapy repeatedly failed for 80 years, caused the most hideous   ³Û
Û³ side effects known to man, and continued to prosper and flourish. It    ³Û
Û³ amazes me that chemotherapy has spread its wings without people knowing.³Û
Û³ For example, how many people know that the commonest therapy for        ³Û
Û³ aggressive psoriasis these days is chemotherapy? Teenagers and people of³Û
Û³ child-bearing age will go to the doctor, and their doctor will say:     ³Û
Û³ "I'll give you a folic acid antagonist called Methotrexate." You see,   ³Û
Û³ "folic acid antagonist" sounds better than "chemotherapy", doesn't it,  ³Û
Û³ but it's chemo. These kids are swallowing poison, and they and their    ³Û
Û³ kids will suffer the consequences.                                      ³Û
Û³ Did you hear about the latest breakthrough, a new form of contraception ³Û
Û³ that's now on the market? It's a one-shot abortion injection. Well, the ³Û
Û³ abortion injection is a folic acid antagonist. It's chemotherapy.       ³Û
Û³ Let's be blunt about something. Alternative therapy is great, and we can³Û
Û³ probably extend and improve the quality of life of people who are ill,  ³Û
Û³ and, heaven knows, we can prevent a lot of diseases from happening; but ³Û
Û³ when you cut down to the chase, conventional therapy and alternative    ³Û
Û³ therapy are joined by one thing.                                        ³Û
Û³ Over the past hundred years in the war against cancer, we've failed     ³Û
Û³ abysmally. Let's be frank here: if a hundred people were to do the most ³Û
Û³ arduous alternative therapy available, we would not cure a hundred      ³Û
Û³ cancer patients; we would not cure a hundred AIDS patients.             ³Û
Û³ There are only three reasons why we're failing in our war. One large    ³Û
Û³ possibility is that the weaponry isn't powerful enough. Now, in         ³Û
Û³ chemotherapy and radiotherapy we have weaponry that can cremate a       ³Û
Û³ person! So, it can't be that one; rule that one out. The second         ³Û
Û³ possibility is that the target is invisible. Now we know that to be     ³Û
Û³ true; we know that cancer cells are immunologically invisible. The third³Û
Û³ possibility is that there's another target.                             ³Û
Û³ The one thing I found depressing about alternative and conventional     ³Û
Û³ therapy is that they both totally ignored the phenomenon of "spontaneous³Û
Û³ remission" which is perhaps the most natural phenomenon which repeatedly³Û
Û³ tells us how to cure terminal disease. "Spontaneous remission" is a term³Û
Û³ given to miraculous healings, where people on their death bed 'rise from³Û
Û³ the dead' within two to three days without a trace of their disease.    ³Û
Û³ It's a phenomenon that's been reported in the literature but hardly ever³Û
Û³ investigated.                                                           ³Û
Û³ The data on spontaneous remission strongly suggest that just before a   ³Û
Û³ person with cancer, heart disease, arthritis or any of the other        ³Û
Û³ terminal diseases has a spontaneous remission or a cure of their        ³Û
Û³ disease, they suffer what seems to be a viral or bacterial or some form ³Û
Û³ of severe infection.                                                    ³Û
Û³ This was noticed by a Dr Didot, in France, who noted that the existence ³Û
Û³ of syphilis precluded the appearance of cancer. If prostitutes had      ³Û
Û³ syphilis, they were very unlikely to develop cancer. This doctor        ³Û
Û³ actually treated 20 cancer patients with syphilis and, of those 20, 14  ³Û
Û³ went into total remission. As the syphilis grew, it munched up the      ³Û
Û³ cancer; the cancer went away. Another three patients did pretty well,   ³Û
Û³ and a couple of them died of the syphilis. But this was a few hundred   ³Û
Û³ years ago, and given the choice between "the Big C" and "the Big S"-well³Û
Û³ , today we can cure syphilis with a couple of shots of penicillin, or so³Û
Û³ I've been told!                                                         ³Û
Û³ Late last century, Dr William Coley had a patient who had bone cancer   ³Û
Û³ and developed a severe syphilis or skin infection. As the skin infection³Û
Û³ grew, it munched on the bone cancer and the bone cancer disappeared. Dr ³Û
Û³ Coley went on to develop what he called "Coley's toxins" and used them  ³Û
Û³ for many years as a therapy that got quite good results.                ³Û
Û³ The trouble here is that Dr Coley succumbed to what I call "macho       ³Û
Û³ medicine". The infection he isolated from the patient, and which cured  ³Û
Û³ the patient, had remarkable successes in subsequent patients treated    ³Û
Û³ with the same infection, but he wasn't happy with that. Coley wanted    ³Û
Û³ something that would do better, so he found a more toxic infection.     ³Û
Û³ Instead of using the specific Streptococcus strain which he'd isolated  ³Û
Û³ from the patient, he found a Streptococcus that kills people, reasoning ³Û
Û³ that it's more toxic, therefore it will kill more cancer, and therefore ³Û
Û³ the chances of cure are better.                                         ³Û
Û³ It's been long known that in areas where malaria exists, there's no     ³Û
Û³ cancer; and when you get rid of malaria, drain the swamps, kill the     ³Û
Û³ mosquitoes, the cancer rate rises. People who have cancer and who catch ³Û
Û³ malaria have a chance of going into remission. Just recently, Dr Henry  ³Û
Û³ Heimlich [who developed the Heimlich manoeuvre for preventing choking]  ³Û
Û³ injected a few AIDS patients with malaria and managed to get them into  ³Û
Û³ some form of remission where they improved and stayed stable at the     ³Û
Û³ improved level.                                                         ³Û
Û³ All these observations led me to come up with something I call "nemesis ³Û
Û³ theory", which states that for every disease there's an antidisease     ³Û
Û³ organism which will specifically attack and destroy it.                 ³Û
Û³ This then led to the development of "nemesis therapy", where I make     ³Û
Û³ extracts of these "nemesis organisms" with which to treat specific      ³Û
Û³ diseases.                                                               ³Û
Û³ And how do you find nemesis organisms? Well, you look around. Where     ³Û
Û³ there's a disease and there's less of another disease, the chances are  ³Û
Û³ that they're antagonistic to each other. Or, you work on basic levels,  ³Û
Û³ as I like to do, and do test after test after test to check.            ³Û
Û³ What I did in the laboratory was get thousands of bottles and place     ³Û
Û³ leukaemia lymph node tumour biopsies in them. Each bottle had a         ³Û
Û³ particular organism growing inside it. The one with affinity for the    ³Û
Û³ cancer actually grabbed hold of the cancer and ate it. This protein     ³Û
Û³ 'web'-actually, a fungus-shot up and encapsulated the tumour. Within a  ³Û
Û³ few days, there was a little bit of the cancer left. A couple of weeks  ³Û
Û³ later, no cancer-just the fungus!                                       ³Û
Û³ So what this does is it gives us this new therapeutic modality. This    ³Û
Û³ nemesis organism can now give us highly specific chemicals that it used ³Û
Û³ to kill the cancer, but which can be made so they do not attack any     ³Û
Û³ other sort of tissue. Two, it can give us tagging complexes which stick ³Û
Û³ to the outside of the cancer and make the cancer highly visible to the  ³Û
Û³ immune system. And three, it can give us a complete range of digestive  ³Û
Û³ enzymes which are specific for digesting the cancer and the cancer      ³Û
Û³ alone. So this little baby not just kills the disease, it also cleans up³Û
Û³ after itself!                                                           ³Û
Û³ With use of the tagging system, if the immune system looks at this      ³Û
Û³ fibrillary network of protein stuck onto the outside of the cancer, it  ³Û
Û³ doesn't see cancer; it sees a bug and it wants to go after the bug. Now,³Û
Û³ you don't inject the bug; you purify the protein extract that sticks to ³Û
Û³ the cancer and you inject that. That then sticks to the cancer in the   ³Û
Û³ body. The body can then see it and recognise it because it's tagged with³Û
Û³ bacterial, fungal or viral protein.                                     ³Û
Û³ You and I have no trouble getting rid of a cough or a cold in a week or ³Û
Û³ two. We can get rid of cancer: make the cancer look like a cough or a   ³Û
Û³ cold by sticking cough or cold particles on it, and the body will attack³Û
Û³ it, destroy it and remove it.                                           ³Û
Û³ However, there were instances where patients had a regression several   ³Û
Û³ months or years after treatment of their tumours with a tagging complex.³Û
Û³ This suggested that tagging the cancer was not the be-all and end-all,  ³Û
Û³ that tagging the cancer cell still didn't cure cancer the disease. There³Û
Û³ was another factor at work.                                             ³Û
Û³ An interesting observation was made about 20 years ago when leukaemia   ³Û
Û³ patients were treated by wiping out their bone marrow and then giving   ³Û
Û³ them somebody else's bone marrow. It was found that the leukaemia would ³Û
Û³ invariably recur. And you know how they say how cancer comes back? Well,³Û
Û³ the doctor says: "Sorry, Mr Jones; it seems that when I was operating   ³Û
Û³ on you and I was giving you the chemo and the radio, one cell spilt, and³Û
Û³ this one cell hid and then went all over the place and grew again-just  ³Û
Û³ this one cell, the spilt cell." One cell or a few cells get loose and   ³Û
Û³ the disease comes back. This may account for some of the cancer         ³Û
Û³ recurrences, but to try to explain all cancer recurrences that way, the ³Û
Û³ medical term for that is "crap"!                                        ³Û
Û³ What we know from those leukaemia trials is that they wiped out the     ³Û
Û³ patient's bone marrow. There was nothing left! They gave him someone    ³Û
Û³ else's bone marrow. Six months later, the leukaemia came back. Now, if  ³Û
Û³ it was a leftover cell, then when you check that leukaemia cell you     ³Û
Û³ should find that it's the same as the leukaemia you treated before the  ³Û
Û³ patient went into remission, true? It should be the same cell come back.³Û
Û³ However, when they ran DNA checks, they found that not only wasn't it   ³Û
Û³ the same cell, but it belonged to the donor. It was the donor's bone    ³Û
Û³ marrow that had turned into leukaemia cells!                            ³Û
Û³ This finding has been published in the conventional medical literature, ³Û
Û³ and it means that cancer the disease is not cancer the cell. There is   ³Û
Û³ something in the body of a patient which regenerates and augments cancer³Û
Û³ , the cancer cell. And if you don't address that, then you won't get rid³Û
Û³ of the disease.                                                         ³Û
Û³ So there I was, with all these little bottles, cooking up these nemesis ³Û
Û³ organisms and tagging them, but something kept showing up over and over ³Û
Û³ and over again which was driving me nuts. I would incubate the cancer   ³Û
Û³ with another organism-say, an E. coli-and I'd find other organisms      ³Û
Û³ growing when the cancer cells died, that I hadn't put in there. They    ³Û
Û³ would usually be staphylococcal or streptococcal in appearance. Acid-   ³Û
Û³ fast bacilli sometimes would show up, depending on what culture medium  ³Û
Û³ was used and for how long I cultured them.                              ³Û
Û³ Now this is really interesting. What you notice is what some people     ³Û
Û³ would call "pleomorphism" in progress. A couple of elements would       ³Û
Û³ develop these elongated rodlike structures, and you could actually see  ³Û
Û³ a coccal form changing into a rodlike form. Pleomorphism in action.     ³Û
Û³ I went to my colleagues and said: "Look, why do I keep getting these    ³Û
Û³ bugs? It's a sterile cancer I'm putting into the bottle, for goodness   ³Û
Û³ sake. I'm incubating with something completely different, and these bugs³Û
Û³ keep showing up." And they said: "Well, Sam, you know what you're like. ³Û
Û³ You probably sneezed and contaminated the whole lot!" Then I said: "It's³Û
Û³ happened over and over and over again. So it's contamination?" "Yes,    ³Û
Û³ yes, absolutely."                                                       ³Û
Û³ A hundred years ago, everybody blamed this contamination as the cause of³Û
Û³ cancer. I have the literature. There were thousands of articles written ³Û
Û³ on bacteria-bacterial and fungal organisms-being the cause of cancer.   ³Û 
Û³ But, as technology gets more and more advanced, we have to reject what's³Û
Û³ obvious; and when we reject what's obvious, the truth becomes very hard ³Û
Û³ to find.                                                                ³Û
Û³ So how could I prove to these people that these organisms are actually  ³Û
Û³ intricately involved in the cancer process or in the AIDS process?      ³Û
Û³ The first thing to do is to grow a bunch of them out of some cancer     ³Û
Û³ cells, inject them into a few animals and see how many animals get      ³Û
Û³ cancer-and a lot of them do. Because the bug does not kill the animal,  ³Û
Û³ the animal develops cancer. In a strange way, it actually appears that  ³Û
Û³ developing the cancer makes the animal live longer.                     ³Û
Û³ Now, let me warp your minds a little bit here. Believe me, what I'm     ³Û
Û³ about to say to you is just a theory, and it has no bearing at all on   ³Û
Û³ the efficacy of the therapy, but what if these bugs can't entice an     ³Û
Û³ immune response? They are contained in the middle of the cancer; the    ³Û
Û³ body is not doing anything to fight them, and yet they're not spreading.³Û
Û³ What's containing them? What if cancer isn't really the enemy? What if  ³Û
Û³ it's the body's last-chance attempt at getting these bugs and           ³Û
Û³ localising them in an area so they don't spread and kill us in a hurry? ³Û
Û³ What if cancer is actually doing us a favour? Is that why every time we ³Û
Û³ fry a cancer lesion with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the whole thing ³Û
Û³ then comes back and explodes all over the place because we're actually  ³Û
Û³ releasing the cause from its entrapment? Just a theory!                 ³Û
Û³ This therapy at the very least can control the disease, and at best can ³Û
Û³ cause dramatic, rapid improvement. There are many cases of cancer tumour³Û
Û³ reducing to half its size within a week or two.                         ³Û
Û³ For example, fig. 1a shows the mammogram of a breast cancer in a 65-year³Û
Û³ -old woman. After 10 days of treatment, the breast is normal (fig. 1b). ³Û
Û³ Fig. 2a shows a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a 32-year-old woman.  ³Û
Û³ After two weeks of treatment, her lymphoma was considerably reduced in  ³Û
Û³ size (fig. 2b). ["Note" No fig's available].                            ³Û
Û³ It's unheard of to be able to do that and not have significant die-off  ³Û
Û³ or toxic effects-and yet they don't exist with this treatment. When you ³Û
Û³ follow nature and follow the guidelines of what happens in spontaneous  ³Û
Û³ remission, Induced Remission Therapy can achieve cures with minimal side³Û
Û³ effects.                                                                ³Û
Û³ I didn't choose the public forum to come here and speak to you today.   ³Û
Û³ Please understand me: I would much rather be addressing medical         ³Û
Û³ practitioners, peers, and getting this out not as an alternative        ³Û
Û³ therapy but as a conventional therapy. I've spent 12 years trying to    ³Û
Û³ get my research published in the conventional literature, and 12 years  ³Û
Û³ going from hospital to hospital and being treated like something they'd ³Û
Û³ stepped in.                                                             ³Û
Û³ In light of what I read in the paper today-somebody wrote an article    ³Û
Û³ condemning this conference-it appears that the message being sent by    ³Û
Û³ that person is that if the conventional medical establishment in all    ³Û
Û³ its holiness doesn't agree with a concept or a therapy, then the public ³Û
Û³ is just too stupid to be able to understand it fully and evaluate it for³Û
Û³ themselves. The attitude is that the public is just so dumb that they   ³Û
Û³ shouldn't be given the opportunity. Well, my apologies to the author,   ³Û
Û³ but the greatest fool I know is a blind fool who'll say opinions about  ³Û
Û³ things he hasn't even bothered experiencing or investigating himself.   ³Û
Û³ In this "Kevorkian age", as I call it, where people champion the concept³Û
Û³ of death with dignity when faced with suffering, pain and disease, I'm  ³Û
Û³ offering a technology that can end suffering, pain and disease; and I   ³Û
Û³ pray that the emphasis will shift now from trying to support death with ³Û
Û³ dignity to championing life with dignity.                               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³                              Part III-Update                            ³Û
Û³                 (Charts not available referenced in text)               ³Û
Û³                                                                         ³Û
Û³ After years of lectures, presentations to peers and public appearances  ³Û
Û³ as well as numerous radio, television, newspaper and magazine           ³Û
Û³ appearances, I find that conventional medicine still has little         ³Û
Û³ awareness of the efficacy of my therapies-as evidenced, for example, in ³Û
Û³ the advances achieved using IRT in AIDS remission (see table 1).        ³Û
Û³ Any doctor can make amazing claims, but independent, unbiased testing is³Û
Û³ a credible way to determine the efficacy of a treatment. It would not   ³Û
Û³ only document the effectiveness of my vaccines but would also stir      ³Û
Û³ interest in any promising new therapy.                                  ³Û
Û³ So I brought case studies of AIDS patients I'd treated to Cedar Sinai   ³Û
Û³ Medical Center for evaluation. Dr Shlomo Melmed was impressed with the  ³Û
Û³ results, and at his suggestion I sent samples of my vaccine to the AIDS ³Û
Û³ and Immune Disorders Center's Division of Infectious Diseases for an    ³Û
Û³ vitro analysis. The clinical analysis performed by Dr. Eric Daar        ³Û
Û³ indicated that out of the 22 samples tested, 20 of them showed 99%      ³Û
Û³ efficacy in neutralising HIV-1.                                         ³Û
Û³ This analysis was followed up with an independent evaluation by         ³Û
Û³ University of Southern California clinical laboratories. This involved  ³Û
Û³ the electron microscopy of blood samples taken by a control group       ³Û
Û³ infected with HIV. This group yielded over 100 photos that demonstrate  ³Û
Û³ the attack, death, disintegration and purge of the HIV virus. The PhD   ³Û
Û³ who conducted this test remarked that "the number of intact viral       ³Û
Û³ particles has declined for each patient following vaccine administration³Û
Û³ at a level approximating 50%".                                          ³Û
Û³ Examples of this progression from attack to purge are shown in figures  ³Û
Û³ 3a to 3d. The first electron microscope photograph (fig. 3a) shows the  ³Û
Û³ fragmenting cell full of HIV particles. The next photo (fig. 3b) shows  ³Û
Û³ the cell three days later, with improved stability and decreased viral  ³Û
Û³ particle count. The third photo (fig. 3c) was taken six days after      ³Û
Û³ vaccine treatment and shows fewer viral particles per cell. The final   ³Û
Û³ photo (fig. 3d), taken nine days after therapy, shows no intracellular  ³Û
Û³ viral particles and the now-visible cell nucleus.                       ³Û
Û³ This evidence from the cellular level demonstrates that AIDS and cancer ³Û
Û³ can be attacked genetically without causing significant damage to the   ³Û
Û³ healthy, fast-multiplying cells needed to maintain a healthy life.      ³Û
Û³ You'd think that the media, the medical community and others would be   ³Û
Û³ alerted to the fantastic results of this treatment.                     ³Û
Û³ It's hard to imagine that institutes entrusted with the public faith and³Û
Û³ public funds to discover and research new therapies would delay the     ³Û
Û³ application of life-saving technology and treatments. It was my hope    ³Û
Û³ that knowledge of IRT would be disseminated and the FDA would allow the ³Û
Û³ practice of this therapy upon the countless AIDS and cancer victims who ³Û
Û³ had little hope otherwise. But these doctors and medical institutes     ³Û
Û³ denied having any affiliation with me. They denied the impressive test  ³Û
Û³ data and even denied knowing me-until forced to declare otherwise before³Û
Û³ a judge in a civil legal action in San Diego, CA (case no. 700406). It  ³Û
Û³ was their incomprehensible behaviour that led me to bring a lawsuit, if ³Û
Û³ for no other reason than to make these test results a record of the     ³Û
Û³ court, but I had to pursue these medical organisations so as to have    ³Û
Û³ access to further laboratory evidence.                                  ³Û
Û³ I've always resented my work being associated under the catch-all phrase³Û
Û³ "alternative medicine". My treatment involves an extremely focused      ³Û
Û³ hybrid of what is considered "conventional medicine". However, in my    ³Û
Û³ pursuit of any form of therapy that could augment or even supersede my  ³Û
Û³ own findings, I've always been interested in alternatives as opposed to ³Û
Û³ conventional, toxic and often barbaric treatments.                      ³Û
Û³ Although there is hope of finding other practitioners who have medical  ³Û 
Û³ information to offer, I have yet to find any breakthroughs that would   ³Û
Û³ complement my own.                                                      ³Û
Û³ I've been appalled to find alternative health organisations that sell   ³Û
Û³ juice drinks, vitamin C shots and laetrile powders to desperate patients³Û
Û³ -products costing hundreds and often thousands of dollars yet only      ³Û
Û³ costing a few cents to make.                                            ³Û
Û³ It was in this spirit that I made this offer: US$100,000 to any         ³Û
Û³ "alternative" therapy that can prove 10 cases of full cancer remission. ³Û
Û³ Additionally, I made this offer to the sceptical world of conventional  ³Û
Û³ medicine: US$100,000 to any reputable medical organisation that will    ³Û
Û³ test and publish the results of my AIDS and cancer vaccines.            ³Û
Û³ No one has yet come forward to make a claim on these offers.            ³Û
Û³ With the realisation that Induced Remission Therapy can offer favourable³Û
Û³ results now, and with the assistance of additional resources, medical   ³Û
Û³ industry professionals who are truly dedicated to curing disease, and   ³Û
Û³ have the ability to catalogue, store and culture autogenous vaccines on ³Û
Û³ a large scale, could and would alter medical treatment as recognised    ³Û
Û³ today. Historically, institutions are resistant to change. Change comes ³Û 
Û³ slowly. So for any promising therapy to be accepted into the mainstream ³Û
Û³ of medical practice, this would require a paradigm shift in medical     ³Û
Û³ science as we know it today.                                            ³Û
Û³ IRT deals with maladies at the genetic level. Indeed, it is the only    ³Û
Û³ therapy now in application that concentrates on disease at this level.  ³Û
Û³ The matrix of many diseases is at the genetic level, so many types of   ³Û
Û³ illness can be treated with IRT.                                        ³Û
Û³ Genetic correction is the only hope for achieving a cure in such disease³Û
Û³ conditions as AIDS and cancer, and starkly contrasts the available toxic³Û
Û³ and inferior modalities that attack disease mechanisms and symptoms     ³Û
Û³ while leaving a damaged blueprint.                                      ³Û
Û³ The best demonstration of this remarkable ability can be seen in the    ³Û
Û³ cases where HIV virus is genetically removed from the cell nucleus. Not ³Û
Û³ only is the body purged of the disease, but it is able to repair damage ³Û
Û³ suffered during the course of the illness. This opens up a new field of ³Û
Û³ cellular regeneration never before possible.                            ³Û
Û³ The capacity to reverse age-and disease-related DNA damage opens a new  ³Û
Û³ world of therapeutic opportunity and almost limitless application.      ³Û
Û³                                                                    ...  ³Û
