Û³ Advances in Tesla Technology: This article is by no means an in-depth   ³Û

Û³ review or tech spec sheet on HAARP, and will only give highlights of    ³Û

Û³ this intrusive project. However reference sources are included for      ³Û

Û³ there are many other articles on the internet that are well worth the   ³Û

Û³ time to read. However this information is important enough for many more³Û

Û³ articles and reprints on the subject to be brought to public attention. ³Û

Û³ There are also many active anti-HAARP groups that are very involved     ³Û

Û³ politically, and with the general public on spreading the true nature   ³Û

Û³ and the very real danger of this project without all the government     ³Û

Û³ masking and misconceptions. A growing assortment of Professional men    ³Û

Û³ and women around the world are using the Internet to draw attention to  ³Û

Û³ this questionable military project in Alaska, and have been for years.  ³Û

Û³ And by using the Internet, e-mailing, and faxing, they are ripping large³Û

Û³ holes in the US Department of Defense misconceptions and lies to the    ³Û

Û³ public about HAARP. And as I say in each issue, it is not our intention ³Û

Û³ for the public to believe any published information blindly. However,   ³Û

Û³ HAARP can disrupt the upper atmosphere with a very focused and steerable³Û

Û³ electromagnetic beam. It is an advanced model of an 'ionospheric heater'³Û

Û³ (The ionosphere is the electrically-charged sphere surrounding Earth's  ³Û

Û³ upper atmosphere. It ranges between about 40 to 600 miles above Earth's ³Û

Û³ surface.)                                                               ³Û 

Û³ Put simply, the apparatus for HAARP is a reversal of a radio telescope. ³Û

Û³ Antennas send out signals instead of receiving. HAARP is the test run   ³Û

Û³ for a super-powerful radio wave beaming technology that lifts areas of  ³Û

Û³ the ionosphere by focusing a intense beam and heating those areas.      ³Û

Û³ Electromagnetic waves then bounce back down onto Earth and penetrate    ³Û

Û³ everything-living and dead. HAARP publicity gives the impression that   ³Û

Û³ the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program is mainly an academic³Û

Û³ project with the goal being of changing the ionosphere to improve       ³Û

Û³ communications for our own good. However, other US military documents   ³Û

Û³ put it more clearly: HAARP aims to learn how to "exploit the ionosphere ³Û

Û³ for Department of Defense purposes".                                    ³Û 

Û³ Press releases and other information, etc. from the military on HAARP   ³Û

Û³ continually downplay what it could do. Publicity documents insist that  ³Û

Û³ the HAARP project is no different than other ionospheric heaters        ³Û

Û³ operating safely throughout the world in places such as Arecibo, Puerto ³Û

Û³ Rico; Tromsø, Norway; and the former Soviet Union. However, a 1990      ³Û

Û³ government document indicates that the radio frequency (RF) power zap   ³Û

Û³ will drive the ionosphere to unnatural activities:                      ³Û

Û³ "...at the highest HF powers available in the West, the instabilities   ³Û

Û³ commonly studied are approaching their maximum RF energy dissipative    ³Û

Û³ capability, beyond which the plasma processes will 'run away' until the ³Û

Û³ next limiting factor is reached."                                       ³Û 

Û³ If the military, in cooperation with the University of Alaska Fairbanks,³Û

Û³ can show that this new ground-based "Star Wars" technology is sound,    ³Û

Û³ they both win. The military has a relatively inexpensive defense shield ³Û

Û³ and the university can then brag about the most dramatic geophysical    ³Û

Û³ manipulation since the atmospheric explosions of nuclear bombs. After   ³Û

Û³ successful testing, they would have the military megaprojects of the    ³Û

Û³ future and huge markets for Alaska's North Slope natural gas.           ³Û

Û³ Looking at the many other patents which built on the work of a Texas    ³Û

Û³ physicist named Bernard Eastlund, it becomes clearer how the military   ³Û

Û³ intends to use the HAARP transmitter. It also makes governmental denials³Û

Û³ less believable. Now the military knows how it intends to use this      ³Û

Û³ technology, and has made it clear in their documents. The military has  ³Û

Û³ deliberately misled the public through sophisticated word games, deceit ³Û

Û³ and outright disinformation.                                            ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³                  The military says the HAARP system could:              ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ a. Give the military a tool to replace the electromagnetic pulse effect ³Û

Û³ of atmospheric thermonuclear devices (still considered a viable option  ³Û

Û³ by the military through at least 1986).                                 ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ b. Totally replace the huge Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) submarine     ³Û

Û³ communication system operating in Michigan and Wisconsin with a new and ³Û

Û³ more compact technology.                                                ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ c. Be used to replace the over-the-horizon radar system that was once   ³Û

Û³ planned for the current location of HAARP, with a more flexible and     ³Û

Û³ accurate system.                                                        ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ d. Provide a way to wipe out communications over an extremely large     ³Û

Û³ area, while keeping the military's own communications systems working.  ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ e. Provide a wide-area Earth-penetrating tomography which, if combined  ³Û

Û³ with the computing abilities of EMASS and Cray computers, would make it ³Û

Û³ possible to verify many parts of nuclear nonproliferation and null peace³Û

Û³ agreements.                                                             ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ f. Be a tool for geophysical probing to find oil, gas and mineral       ³Û

Û³ deposits over a large area.                                             ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ g. Be used to detect incoming low-level planes and cruise missiles,     ³Û

Û³ making other technologies obsolete.                                     ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ Now the above abilities seem like a good idea to all who believe in     ³Û

Û³ sound national defense and to those concerned about cost-cutting.       ³Û

Û³ However, the possible uses which the HAARP records do not explain, and  ³Û

Û³ which can only be found in US Air Force, Army, Navy and other federal   ³Û

Û³ agency records, are alarming. Moreover, effects from the reckless use of³Û

Û³ these power levels in our natural shield-the ionosphere-could very well ³Û

Û³ be cataclysmic, according to many scientists.                           ³Û

Û³ Two Alaskans put it bluntly. A founder of the NO HAARP movement, Clare  ³Û

Û³ Zickuhr, says: "The military is going to give the ionosphere a big kick ³Û

Û³ and see what happens."                                                  ³Û 

Û³ The military failed to tell the public that they do not know what       ³Û

Û³ exactly will happen, but a Penn State science article brags about that  ³Û

Û³ uncertainty. Macho science? The HAARP project uses the largest energy   ³Û

Û³ levels yet played with, "the big boys with their new toys". It is an    ³Û

Û³ experiment on the sky, and experiments are done to find out something   ³Û

Û³ not already known. Independent scientists state that a HAARP-type       ³Û

Û³ 'skybuster' with its unforeseen effects could be an act of global       ³Û

Û³ vandalism.                                                              ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ The patents described below were the package of ideas which were        ³Û

Û³ originally controlled by ARCO Power Technologies Incorporated (APTI),   ³Û

Û³ a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Company, one of the biggest oil      ³Û

Û³ companies in the world. APTI was the contractor that built the HAARP    ³Û

Û³ facility. ARCO sold this subsidiary, the patents and the second phase   ³Û

Û³ construction contract to E-Systems in June 1994.                        ³Û

Û³ E-Systems is one of the biggest intelligence contractors in the world,  ³Û

Û³ doing work for the CIA, defense intelligence organizations and others.  ³Û

Û³ US$1.8 billion of their annual sales are to these organizations, with   ³Û

Û³ $800 million for black projects-projects so secret that even the United ³Û

Û³ States Congress isn't told how the money is being spent.                ³Û

Û³ E-Systems was bought out by Raytheon which is one of the largest defense³Û 

Û³ contractors in the world. In 1994 Raytheon was listed as number 42 on   ³Û

Û³ the "Fortune 500" list of companies. Raytheon has thousands of patents, ³Û

Û³ some of which will be valuable in the HAARP project. Twelve patents are ³Û

Û³ the backbone of the HAARP project, and are now buried among the         ³Û

Û³ thousands of others held in the name of Raytheon.                       ³Û

Û³ Bernard J. Eastlund's US Patent #4,686,605, "Method and Apparatus for   ³Û

Û³ Altering a Region in the Earth's Atmosphere, Ionosphere and/or          ³Û

Û³ Magnetosphere", was sealed for a year under a government secrecy order. ³Û

Û³ The Eastlund ionospheric heater was different: the radio frequency (RF) ³Û

Û³ radiation was concentrated and focused to a point in the ionosphere.    ³Û

Û³ This difference throws an unprecedented amount of energy into the       ³Û

Û³ ionosphere. The Eastlund device would allow a concentration of one watt ³Û

Û³ per cubic centimetre, compared to others only able to deliver about one ³Û

Û³ millionth of one watt.                                                  ³Û 

Û³ This huge difference could lift and change the ionosphere in the ways   ³Û

Û³ necessary to create futuristic effects described in the patent.         ³Û

Û³ According to the patent, the work of Nikola Tesla in the early 1900s    ³Û

Û³ formed the basis of the research.                                       ³Û 

Û³ What would this technology be worth to ARCO, the owner of the patents?  ³Û

Û³ They could make enormous profits by beaming electrical power, without   ³Û

Û³ wires, from a powerhouse in the gas fields to the consumer.             ³Û

Û³ For a time, HAARP researchers could not prove that this was one of the  ³Û

Û³ intended uses for HAARP. In April 1995, however, other relative patents ³Û

Û³ where found, connected with a 'key personnel' list for APTI. Some of    ³Û

Û³ these new APTI patents were indeed a wireless system for sending        ³Û

Û³ electrical power.                                                       ³Û 

Û³ Eastlund's patent said the technology can confuse or completely disrupt ³Û

Û³ airplanes' and missiles' sophisticated guidance systems. Further, this  ³Û

Û³ ability to spray large areas of Earth with electromagnetic waves of     ³Û

Û³ varying frequencies, and to control changes in those waves, makes it    ³Û

Û³ possible to knock out communications on land or sea as well as in the   ³Û

Û³ air. The patent said:                                                   ³Û 

Û³ "Thus, this invention provides the ability to put unprecedented amounts ³Û

Û³ of power in the Earth's atmosphere at strategic locations and to        ³Û

Û³ maintain the power injection level, particularly if random pulsing is   ³Û

Û³ employed, in a manner far more precise and better controlled than       ³Û

Û³ heretofore accomplished by the prior art, particularly by detonation of ³Û

Û³ nuclear devices of various yields at various altitudes...               ³Û

Û³ "...it is possible not only to interfere with third party communications³Û

Û³ but to take advantage of one or more such beams to carry out a          ³Û

Û³ communications network even though the rest of the world's              ³Û

Û³ communications are disrupted. Put another way, what is used to disrupt  ³Û

Û³ another's communications can be employed by one knowledgeable of this   ³Û

Û³ invention as a communication network at the same time.                  ³Û

Û³ "...large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to an unexpectedly  ³Û

Û³ high altitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and unplanned drag  ³Û

Û³ forces with resultant destruction...                                    ³Û 

Û³ "Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper       ³Û

Û³ atmosphere wind patterns by constructing one or more plumes of          ³Û

Û³ atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device. ...  ³Û

Û³ molecular modifications of the atmosphere can take place so that        ³Û

Û³ positive environmental effects can be achieved. Besides actually        ³Û

Û³ changing the molecular composition of an atmospheric region, a          ³Û

Û³ particular molecule or molecules can be chosen for increased presence.  ³Û

Û³ For example, ozone, nitrogen, etc. concentrations in the atmosphere     ³Û

Û³ could be artificially increased..."                                     ³Û 

Û³ Eleven other APTI patents turned up. They told how to make "Nuclear-    ³Û

Û³ sized Explosions without Radiation", power-beaming systems, over-the-   ³Û

Û³ horizon radar, detection systems for missiles carrying nuclear warheads,³Û

Û³ electromagnetic pulses previously produced by thermonuclear weapons and ³Û

Û³ other "Star Wars" tricks. This cluster of patents underlay the HAARP    ³Û

Û³ weapon system.                                                          ³Û 

Û³ Related research by Begich and Manning "Authers & researchers of "Angels³Û

Û³ don't play with HAARP" uncovered bizarre schemes. For example, US Air   ³Û

Û³ Force documents revealed that a system had been developed for           ³Û

Û³ manipulating and disrupting human mental processes through pulsed radio-³Û

Û³ frequency radiation (the stuff of HAARP) over large geographical areas. ³Û

Û³ The most telling material about this technology came from writings of   ³Û

Û³ Zbigniew Brzezinski (former National Security Adviser to US President   ³Û

Û³ Carter) and J. F. MacDonald (science adviser to US President Johnson and³Û

Û³ a Professor of Geophysics at UCLA), as they wrote about use of power-   ³Û

Û³ beaming transmitters for geophysical and environmental warfare. The     ³Û

Û³ documents showed how these effects might be caused, and the negative    ³Û

Û³ effects on human health and thinking.                                   ³Û 

Û³ The mental-disruption possibilities for HAARP are the most disturbing.  ³Û

Û³ More than 40 pages of the book, with dozens of footnotes, chronicle the ³Û

Û³ work of Harvard professors, military planners and scientists as they    ³Û

Û³ plan and test this use of the electromagnetic technology. For example,  ³Û

Û³ one of the papers describing this use was from the International Red    ³Û

Û³ Cross in Geneva. It even gave the frequency ranges where these effects  ³Û

Û³ could occur-the same ranges which HAARP is capable of broadcasting.     ³Û

Û³ The following statement was made more than 25 years ago in a book which ³Û

Û³ Brzezinski wrote while a professor at Columbia University:              ³Û

Û³ "Political strategists are tempted to exploit research on the brain and ³Û

Û³ human behavior. Geophysicist Gordon J. F. MacDonald-specialist in       ³Û

Û³ problems of warfare-says accurately-timed, artificially-excited         ³Û

Û³ electronic strokes 'could lead to a pattern of oscillations that produce³Û

Û³ relatively high power levels over certain regions of the Earth... In    ³Û

Û³ this way, one could develop a system that would seriously impair the    ³Û

Û³ brain performance of very large populations in selected regions over an ³Û

Û³ extended period...' No matter how deeply disturbing the thought of      ³Û

Û³ using the environment to manipulate behavior for national advantages,   ³Û

Û³ to some the technology permitting such use will very probably develop   ³Û

Û³ within the next few decades."                                           ³Û 

Û³ In 1966, MacDonald was a member of the President's Science Advisory     ³Û

Û³ Committee and later a member of the President's Council on Environmental³Û

Û³ Quality. He published papers on the use of environmental control        ³Û

Û³ technologies for military purposes. The most profound comment he made   ³Û

Û³ as a geophysicist was:                                                  ³Û 

Û³ "The key to geophysical warfare is the identification of environmental  ³Û

Û³ instabilities to which the addition of a small amount of energy would   ³Û

Û³ release vastly greater amounts of energy."                              ³Û

Û³ While yesterday's geophysicists predicted today's advances, are HAARP   ³Û

Û³ program managers delivering on the vision? The geophysicists recognized ³Û

Û³ that adding energy to the environmental soup could have large effects.  ³Û

Û³ However, humankind has already added substantial amounts of             ³Û

Û³ electromagnetic energy into our environment without understanding what  ³Û

Û³ might constitute critical mass. The reports by Begich and Manning raises³Û

Û³ questions. Have these additions been without effect, or is there a      ³Û

Û³ cumulative amount beyond which irreparable damage can be done? Is HAARP ³Û

Û³ another step in a journey from which we cannot turn back? Are we about  ³Û

Û³ to embark on another energy experiment which unleashes another set of   ³Û

Û³ demons from Pandora's box?                                              ³Û 

Û³ As early as 1970, Zbigniew Brzezinski predicted a "more controlled and  ³Û

Û³ directed society" would gradually appear, linked to technology. This    ³Û

Û³ society would be dominated by an elite group which impresses voters by  ³Û

Û³ allegedly superior scientific know-how. Angels Don't Play This HAARP    ³Û

Û³ further quotes Brzezinski:                                              ³Û 

Û³ "Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite ³Û

Û³ would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest    ³Û

Û³ modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society   ³Û

Û³ under close surveillance and control. Technical and scientific momentum ³Û

Û³ would then feed on the situation it exploits," Brzezinski predicted.    ³Û

Û³ His forecasts proved accurate. Today, a number of new tools for the     ³Û

Û³ "elite" are emerging, and the temptation to use them increases steadily.³Û

Û³ The policies to permit the tools to be used are already in place. How   ³Û

Û³ could the United States be changed, bit by bit, into the predicted      ³Û

Û³ highly-controlled technosociety? Among the 'stepping stones' Brzezinski ³Û

Û³ expected were persisting social crises and use of the mass media to     ³Û

Û³ gain the public's confidence.                                           ³Û 

Û³ In another document prepared by the government, the US Air Force claims:³Û

Û³ "The potential applications of artificial electromagnetic fields are    ³Û

Û³ wide-ranging and can be used in many military or quasi-military         ³Û

Û³ situations... Some of these potential uses include dealing with         ³Û

Û³ terrorist groups, crowd control, controlling breaches of security at    ³Û

Û³ military installations, and antipersonnel techniques in tactical        ³Û

Û³ warfare. In all of these cases the EM (electromagnetic) systems would   ³Û

Û³ be used to produce mild to severe physiological disruption or perceptual³Û

Û³ distortion or disorientation. In addition, the ability of individuals   ³Û

Û³ to function could be degraded to such a point that they would be combat-³Û

Û³ ineffective. Another advantage of electromagnetic systems is that they  ³Û

Û³ can provide coverage over large areas with a single system. They are    ³Û

Û³ silent, and countermeasures to them may be difficult to develop... One  ³Û

Û³ last area where electromagnetic radiation may prove of some value is in ³Û 

Û³ enhancing abilities of individuals for anomalous phenomena."            ³Û

Û³ Do these comments point to uses already somewhat developed? The author  ³Û

Û³ of the government report refers to an earlier Air Force document about  ³Û

Û³ the uses of radio-frequency radiation in combat situations. (Here,      ³Û

Û³ Begich and Manning note that HAARP is the most versatile and the largest³Û

Û³ radio-frequency radiation transmitter in the world.)                    ³Û

Û³ The United States congressional record deals with the use of HAARP for  ³Û 

Û³ penetrating the Earth with signals bounced off the ionosphere. These    ³Û

Û³ signals are used to look inside the planet to a depth of many kilometres³Û

Û³ in order to locate underground munitions, minerals and tunnels. For 1996³Û

Û³ the US Senate has set aside US$15 million to develop this ability alone:³Û

Û³ Earth-penetrating tomography. The problem is that the frequency needed  ³Û

Û³ for Earth-penetrating radiations is within the frequency range most     ³Û

Û³ cited for disruption of human mental functions. It may also have        ³Û

Û³ profound effects on migration patterns of fish and wild animals which   ³Û

Û³ rely on an undisturbed energy field to find their routes.               ³Û

Û³ As if electromagnetic pulses in the sky and mental disruption were not  ³Û 

Û³ enough, Eastlund bragged that the super-powerful ionospheric heater     ³Û

Û³ could control weather. Begich and Manning brought to light government   ³Û

Û³ documents indicating that the military has weather-control technology.  ³Û

Û³ When HAARP is eventually built to its full power level, it could create ³Û

Û³ weather effects over entire hemispheres. If one government experiments  ³Û

Û³ with the world's weather patterns, what is done in one place will impact³Û

Û³ everyone else on the planet.                                            ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher, Ph.D., has a long and impressive career in high-³Û

Û³ energy physics, and has been published in prestigious science journals  ³Û

Û³ and books. Rauscher commented on HAARP: "You're pumping tremendous      ³Û

Û³ energy into an extremely delicate molecular configuration that comprises³Û

Û³ these multi-layers we call the ionosphere." The ionosphere is prone to  ³Û

Û³ catalytic reactions, she explained: if a small part is changed, a major ³Û

Û³ change in the ionosphere can happen.                                    ³Û 

Û³ In describing the ionosphere as a delicately balanced system, Dr.       ³Û

Û³ Rauscher shared her mental picture of it: a soap bubble-like sphere     ³Û

Û³ surrounding Earth's atmosphere, with movements swirling over the        ³Û

Û³ surface of the bubble. If a big enough hole is punched through it, she  ³Û

Û³ predicts it could pop.                                                  ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ Physicist Daniel Winter, Ph.D., of Waynesville, North Carolina, says    ³Û

Û³ HAARP high-frequency emissions can couple with long wave (low frequency ³Û

Û³ or ELF) pulses the Earth grid uses to distribute information as         ³Û

Û³ vibrations to synchronise dances of life in the biosphere. Dan terms    ³Û

Û³ this geomagnetic action "Earth's information bloodstream", and says it  ³Û

Û³ is likely that coupling of HAARP HF (high frequency) with natural ELF   ³Û

Û³ (extremely low frequency) can cause unplanned, unsuspected side-effects.³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ David Yarrow of Albany, New York, is a researcher with a background in  ³Û

Û³ electronics. He described possible interactions of HAARP radiations with³Û

Û³ the ionosphere and Earth's magnetic grid:                               ³Û

Û³ "HAARP will not burn 'holes' in the ionosphere. That is a dangerous     ³Û

Û³ understatement of what HAARP's giant gigawatt beam will do. Earth is    ³Û

Û³ spinning relative to thin electric shells of the multilayer membrane of ³Û

Û³ 'iono-spheres' that absorb and shield Earth's surface from intense solar³Û

Û³ radiation, including charged particle storms in solar winds erupting    ³Û

Û³ from the Sun. Earth's axial spin means that HAARP-in a burst lasting    ³Û

Û³ more than a few minutes-will slice through the ionosphere like a        ³Û

Û³ microwave knife. This produces not a hole, but a long tear-in incision. ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ "Second concept: As Earth rotates, HAARP will slice across geomagnetic  ³Û

Û³ flux...a donut-shaped spool of magnetic strings-like longitude meridians³Û

Û³ (on maps). HAARP may not 'cut' these strings in Gaia's magnetic mantle, ³Û

Û³ but will pulse each thread with harsh, out-of-harmony high frequencies. ³Û

Û³ These noisy impulses will vibrate geomagnetic flux lines, sending       ³Û

Û³ vibrations all through the geomagnetic web.                             ³Û

Û³ "The image comes to mind of a spider on its web. An insect lands, and   ³Û

Û³ the web's vibrations alert the spider to possible prey. HAARP will be   ³Û

Û³ a manmade microwave finger poking at the web, sending out confusing     ³Û

Û³ signals, if not tearing holes in the threads.                           ³Û

Û³ "Effects of this interference with symphonies of Gaia's geomagnetic     ³Û

Û³ harp are unknown, and I suspect barely thought of. Even if thought of,  ³Û

Û³ the intent [of HAARP] is to learn to exploit any effects, not to play   ³Û

Û³ in tune to global symphonies."                                          ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ Among other researchers quoted is Paul Schaefer of Kansas City. His     ³Û

Û³ degree is in electrical engineering and he spent four years building    ³Û

Û³ nuclear weapons. "But most of the theories that we have been taught by  ³Û

Û³ scientists to believe in seem to be falling apart," he says. He talks   ³Û

Û³ about imbalances already caused by the industrial and atomic age,       ³Û

Û³ especially by radiation of large numbers of tiny, high-velocity         ³Û

Û³ particles "like very small spinning tops" into our environment. The     ³Û

Û³ unnatural level of motion of highly energetic particles in the          ³Û 

Û³ atmosphere and in radiation belts surrounding Earth is the villain in   ³Û

Û³ the weather disruptions, according to this model which describes an     ³Û

Û³ Earth discharging its buildup of heat, relieving stress and regaining   ³Û

Û³ a balanced condition through earthquakes and volcanic action.           ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ "One might compare the abnormal energetic state of the Earth and its    ³Û

Û³ atmosphere to a car battery which has become overcharged with the normal³Û

Û³ flow of energy jammed up, resulting in hot spots, electrical arcing,    ³Û

Û³ physical cracks and general turbulence as the pent-up energy tries to   ³Û

Û³ find some place to go."                                                 ³Û 

Û³ In a second analogy, Schaefer says:                                     ³Û 

Û³ "Unless we desire the death of our planet, we must end the production   ³Û

Û³ of unstable particles which are generating the Earth's fever. A first   ³Û

Û³ priority to prevent this disaster would be to shut down all nuclear     ³Û

Û³ power plants and end the testing of atomic weapons, electronic warfare  ³Û

Û³ and 'Star Wars'."                                                       ³Û 

Û³ Meanwhile, the military builds its biggest ionospheric heater yet, to   ³Û

Û³ deliberately create more instabilities in a huge plasma layer-the       ³Û

Û³ ionosphere-and to rev up the energy level of charged particles.         ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ The military has published papers about electron precipitation from the ³Û

Û³ magnetosphere (the outer belts of charged particles which stream toward ³Û

Û³ Earth's magnetic poles) caused by manmade very-low-frequency            ³Û

Û³ electromagnetic waves:                                                  ³Û 

Û³ "These precipitated particles can produce secondary ionization, emit    ³Û

Û³ X-rays, and cause significant perturbation in the lower ionosphere."    ³Û

Û³ Two Stanford University radio scientists offer evidence of what         ³Û

Û³ technology can do to affect the sky by making waves on Earth. They      ³Û

Û³ showed that very low frequency radio waves can vibrate the magnetosphere³Û

Û³ and cause high-energy particles to cascade into the Earth's atmosphere. ³Û

Û³ By turning the signal on or off, they could stop the flow of energetic  ³Û

Û³ particles.                                                              ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ Avalanches of energy dislodged by such radio waves could hit us hard.   ³Û

Û³ Their work suggests that technicians could control global weather by    ³Û

Û³ sending relatively small 'signals' into the Van Allen belts (radiation  ³Û

Û³ belts around Earth). Thus Tesla's resonance effects can control         ³Û

Û³ enormous energies by tiny triggering signals.                           ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ The military has had about 20 years to work on weather warfare methods, ³Û

Û³ which it euphemistically calls weather modification. For example,       ³Û

Û³ rainmaking technology was taken for a few test rides in Vietnam. The    ³Û

Û³ US Department of Defense sampled lightning and hurricane manipulation   ³Û

Û³ studies in Project Skyfire and Project Stormfury. And they looked at    ³Û

Û³ some complicated technologies that would give big effects. Angels Don't ³Û

Û³ Play This HAARP cites an expert who says the military studied both      ³Û

Û³ lasers and chemicals which they figured could damage the ozone layer    ³Û

Û³ over an enemy. Looking at ways to cause earthquakes, as well as to      ³Û

Û³ detect them, was part of the project named Prime Argus, decades ago.    ³Û

Û³ The money for that came from the Defense Advanced Research Projects     ³Û

Û³ Agency (DARPA, now under the acronym ARPA).                             ³Û

Û³ In 1994 the US Air Force revealed its Spacecast 2020 master plan which  ³Û

Û³ includes weather control. Scientists have experimented with weather     ³Û

Û³ control since the 1940s, but Spacecast 2020 noted that "using           ³Û

Û³ environmental modification techniques to destroy, damage or injure      ³Û

Û³ another state [is] prohibited". Having said that, the Air Force claimed ³Û

Û³ that advances in technology "compels a re-examination of this sensitive ³Û

Û³ and potentially risky topic".                                           ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ As far back as 1958, the chief White House adviser on weather           ³Û

Û³ modification, Captain Howard T. Orville, said the US defense department ³Û

Û³ was studying "ways to manipulate the charges of the Earth and sky and   ³Û

Û³ so affect the weather by using an electronic beam to ionize or de-ionize³Û

Û³ the atmosphere over a given area.                                       ³Û 

Û³ In 1966, Professor Gordon J. F. MacDonald was Associate Director of the ³Û

Û³ Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of      ³Û

Û³ California, Los Angeles, was a member of the President's Science        ³Û

Û³ Advisory Committee, and later a member of the President's Council on    ³Û

Û³ Environmental Quality. He published papers on the use of environmental  ³Û

Û³ control technologies for military purposes. MacDonald made a revealing  ³Û

Û³ comment:                                                                ³Û 

Û³ "The key to geophysical warfare is the identification of environmental  ³Û

Û³ instabilities to which the addition of a small amount of energy would   ³Û

Û³ release vastly greater amounts of energy."                              ³Û

Û³ World-recognized scientist MacDonald had a number of ideas for using    ³Û

Û³ the environment as a weapon system and he contributed to what was, at   ³Û

Û³ the time, the dream of a futurist. When he wrote his chapter, "How to   ³Û

Û³ Wreck the Environment", for the book Unless Peace Comes, he was not     ³Û

Û³ kidding around. In it he describes the use of weather manipulation,     ³Û

Û³ climate modification, polar ice-cap melting or destabilization, ozone   ³Û

Û³ depletion techniques, earthquake engineering, ocean wave control and    ³Û

Û³ brainwave manipulation using the planet's energy fields. He also said   ³Û

Û³ that these types of weapons would be developed and, when used, would be ³Û

Û³ virtually undetectable by their victims. Is HAARP that weapon? The      ³Û

Û³ military's intention to do environmental engineering is well-documented.³Û

Û³ Congress's subcommittee hearings on Oceans and International Environment³Û

Û³ looked into military weather and climate modification conducted in the  ³Û

Û³ early 1970s. "What emerged was an awesome picture of far-ranging        ³Û

Û³ research and experimentation by the Department of Defense into ways     ³Û

Û³ environmental tampering could be used as a weapon," said another author.³Û

Û³ The revealed secrets surprised legislators. Would an inquiry into the   ³Û

Û³ state of the art of electromagnetic manipulation surprise lawmakers     ³Û

Û³ today? They may find out that technologies developed out of the HAARP   ³Û

Û³ experiments in Alaska could deliver on Gordon MacDonald's vision,       ³Û

Û³ because leading-edge scientists are describing global weather as not    ³Û

Û³ only air pressure and thermal systems but also as an electrical system. ³Û

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ HAARP zaps the ionosphere where it is relatively unstable. A point to   ³Û

Û³ remember is that the ionosphere is an active electrical shield          ³Û

Û³ protecting the planet from the constant bombardment of high-energy      ³Û

Û³ particles from space. This conducting plasma, along with Earth's        ³Û

Û³ magnetic field, traps the electrical plasma of space and holds it back  ³Û

Û³ from going directly to the Earth's surface, says Charles Yost of        ³Û

Û³ Dynamic Systems, Leicester, North Carolina:                             ³Û

Û³ "If the ionosphere is greatly disturbed, the atmosphere below is        ³Û

Û³ subsequently disturbed."                                                ³Û 

Û³ Another scientist interviewed said there is a super-powerful electrical ³Û

Û³ connection between the ionosphere and the part of the atmosphere where  ³Û

Û³ our weather comes onstage: the lower atmosphere.                        ³Û

Û³ One manmade electrical effect-power-line harmonic resonance-causes      ³Û

Û³ fallout of charged particles from the Van Allen (radiation) belts, and  ³Û

Û³ the falling ions cause ice crystals (which precipitate rain clouds).    ³Û

Û³ What about HAARP? Energy blasted upward from an ionospheric heater is   ³Û

Û³ not much compared to the total in the ionosphere, but HAARP documents   ³Û

Û³ admit that thousandfold greater amounts of energy can be released in    ³Û

Û³ the ionosphere than injected. As with MacDonald's "key to geophysical   ³Û

Û³ warfare", "nonlinear" effects (described in the literature about the    ³Û

Û³ ionospheric heater) mean small input and large output.                  ³Û

Û³ Astrophysicist Adam Trombly told Manning that an acupuncture model is   ³Û

Û³ one way to look at the possible effect of multi-gigawatt pulsing of the ³Û

Û³ ionosphere. If HAARP hits certain points, those parts of the ionosphere ³Û

Û³ could react in surprising ways.                                         ³Û 

Û³ Smaller ionospheric heaters such as the one at Arecibo are underneath   ³Û

Û³ relatively placid regions of the ionosphere compared to the dynamic     ³Û

Û³ movements nearer Earth's magnetic poles. That adds another uncertainty  ³Û

Û³ to HAARP: the unpredictable and lively upper atmosphere near the North  ³Û

Û³ Pole.                                                                   ³Û 

Û³ HAARP experimenters do not impress common-sense Alaskans such as Barbara³Û

Û³ Zickuhr, who says: "They're like boys playing with a sharp stick,       ³Û

Û³ finding a sleeping bear and poking it in the butt to see what's going   ³Û

Û³ to happen."                                                             ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û 

Û³ Earth as a spherical electrical system is a fairly well-accepted model. ³Û

Û³ However, those experimenters who want to make unnatural power           ³Û

Û³ connections between parts of this system might not be thinking of       ³Û

Û³ possible consequences. Electrical motors and generators can be caused   ³Û

Û³ to wobble when their circuits are affected. Could human activities      ³Û

Û³ cause a significant change in a planet's electrical circuit or          ³Û

Û³ electrical field? A paper in the respected journal Science deals with   ³Û

Û³ manmade ionization from radioactive material, but perhaps it could also ³Û

Û³ be studied with HAARP-type skybusters in mind:                          ³Û

Û³ "For example, while changes in the Earth's electric field resulting     ³Û

Û³ from a solar flare modulating conductivity may have only a barely       ³Û

Û³ detectable effect on meteorology, the situation may be different in     ³Û

Û³ regard to electric field changes caused by manmade ionization..."       ³Û

Û³ Meteorology, of course, is the study of the atmosphere and weather.     ³Û

Û³ Ionization is what happens when a higher level of power is zapped into  ³Û

Û³ atoms and knocks electrons off the atoms. The resulting charged         ³Û

Û³ particles are the stuff of HAARP. "One look at the weather should tell  ³Û

Û³ us that we are on the wrong path," says Paul Schaefer, commenting on    ³Û

Û³ HAARP-type technologies: Advances in Tesla Technology is about the      ³Û

Û³ military's plan to manipulate that which belongs to the world: the      ³Û

Û³ ionosphere. The arrogance of the United States Government in this is    ³Û

Û³ not without precedent. Atmospheric nuclear tests had similar goals.     ³Û

Û³ More recently, China and France put their people's money to destructive ³Û

Û³ use in underground nuclear tests. It was recently reported that the     ³Û

Û³ US Government spent US$3 trillion on its nuclear program since its      ³Û

Û³ beginnings in the 1940s. What new breakthroughs in life science could   ³Û

Û³ have been made with all the money spent on death?                       ³Û

Û³ Many believe that democracies need to be founded on openness rather     ³Û

Û³ than the secrecy which surrounds so much military science. Knowledge    ³Û

Û³ used in developing revolutionary weapons could be used for healing and  ³Û

Û³ helping mankind. Because they are used in new weapons, discoveries are  ³Û

Û³ classified and suppressed. When they do appear in the work of other     ³Û

Û³ independent scientists, the new ideas are often frustrated or           ³Û

Û³ ridiculed, while military research laboratories continue to build their ³Û

Û³ new machines for the killing fields.                                    ³Û 

Û³ However, it is hoped by many that the military-industrial-academic-     ³Û

Û³ bureaucratic Goliaths can be affected by the combined power of          ³Û

Û³ determined individuals and the alternative press. Becoming informed     ³Û

Û³ is the first step to empowerment.                                       ³Û 

Û³                                                                         ³Û
