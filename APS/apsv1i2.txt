 Section [1]: Editorial


        Well, here it is...Issue Two has finally arrived.. 
 I'm now on school holidays, with only about 5 weeks of school left 'till
 the end of my fucking high school career. This may be the last issue for
 a while, especially if we don't get some contributions from the readers.
 I know this publication is read by some people, and I'll be uploading it
 to the 'net soon as I get back to school (My net access is through my school)
 If you regularly read this, please contibute. I had a couple of submissions,
 but sorry SaNe, I already had that info and so did a lot of others. Mistix
 gave me something interesting, thats in the Aust phone system part...
        Hope you dudes n-joi this publication...Australia's own....B4 I forget
 I must mention something that totally pisses me off. The elitism of the 
 Australian hacker scene. There are a fucking few of us around, and you'd 
 think that the scene would welcome newcomers. NO!! You must find your own
 way around until you are considered EleEtE....What i'm on about is that I
 dialled a h/p BBS in Perth (No names hey JESTA!!!) and answered their 
 fucking questionaire, getting most of them pretty fucking correct. I emailed
 the sysop, HEY JESTA!!, and instead of trying to bull shit my way on like
 a lame motherfucker I just gave him da facts. What do I get back. NO way
 d00d, you're not getting on this board. Well fuck you very much. Australia
 needs to nurture it's h/p scene, not kill it off with eleetism. Anyone with
 any h/p board nos. contact me. I'll try em all and see how eleete they are
 when I crash their puny systems.....Next time ravers...

 Sektion [2]: Dynix Systems
                - By Sen Goku

        Dynix systems?? I hear you all say..What is a Dynix System??? Well,
 it sounds like some kind of Unix type system, but it's not. Have you ever
 been in a modernised public or school library, a music store or even a 
 department store?? If you take a close look at the computing infra-structure
 you're bound to see a Dynix based system lying around, waiting to be used.
        These are the dinky little black and green or brown and gold terminals
 that sit on desks with only a monitor and keyboard present. At the back of
 the monitor is a cable, that links into a serial link to the main server.
 You'll probably recognise one, because when you log into one it welcomes you
 with a huge ascii screen saying, Welcome to the Dynix system, or some crap
 like that.
        These little babies can be useful, because if you can hack out a 
 priveledged password and login, then you have full run of the main server,
 and remotely! Getting the password is relatively simple. Just ask your 
 friendly staff member to logon because the computer isn't working. Their
 user ID is shown on screen, but of course the password is hidden, so watch
 the keys. These people type so slow, that it is easy to read the password.
        Before you get the staff member to logon, I suggest you play around
 a bit. The terminals I have hacked have all been relatively simple to use and
 get into, but once in, another password is needed to make changes. This can
 be a real bastard to get. To get this, I again suggest you watch the staff
 member when they use the terminal legitimately. To make a change to the
 system, they must enter a password. This password varies, but the one's I've
 come across were three letter combinations (KEY, PIK) and a five letter one
 what I have'nt been able to read yet. They are all relatively simple so the
 staff members can all make the changes. Only one password is needed to make
 the changes. It is standardised throughout the system.
        Ways in which you can get the staff memeber to enter the password to
 make changes vary. You can extend a book you have borrowed, say you have
 changed adress or any other thing like the such. Just watch the keyboard
 a couple times and get the password. This is all helpful for changing data on
 the system, but how do you get into the system i hear you all scream. This
 is the bit where you get the employee to log on for you.
        When the system is first powered up for the day, each terminal must
 be logged onto. Once a terminal is logged on, there is now way to relogon
 to get to another part of the system unless you reset the server. Hence, it
 is important to catch the machine at logon, first thing in the morning. When
 the system is first turned on for the day, a welcome to dynix screen is
 presented along with a prompt to logon. You will see




                          Welcome to Dynix Systems




                           Etc..Huge ascii drawing



                    Logon:
                    User ID:
                    Password:


 The logon is what part of the system you want this terminal to be attached
 to. The valid ones that I have found have been CIRC, BASS and PUB. CIRC
 stands for circulation(God mode), BASS stands for BASS(Ticket ordering at a
 music shop, God mode) and PUB for public, where there is no rights to much.
        The user ID is an employee who uses the system. Normally this is a
 persons name such as KAREN or KSCHLEIN. The password is even simpler. Of all
 the IDs and passwords that I have discovered, about 70% of the passwords
 have been the employees telephone number. Lame...
        Once logged on into god mode and a valid user ID and password have
 been entered, a lot can be acheived. One way of spoofing the employee to
 logging onto a priveledged mode it to enter the logon yourself. Entering
 CIRC and then calling the employee over will get them typing their ID and
 password. Quite often they will recognise that they are in the wrong mode
 for a public terminal and look at you funny, but sometimes they just walk
 away and leave you to your fun.
        When in god mode, you have the rights to change anything. The problem
 that you need that damn password to change data. When you go to change data,
 you are prompted with a little message down the bottom of the screen.

 Enter Password:

        Now this is a real pain. I was using a system recently in god mode,
 and went to change some data (Erase overdue books) The problem was I didn't
 have the correct password to modify the stuff. This can be a real pain in
 the arse. I looked around everywhere, including near the server but couldn't
 find the password. One little thing kept me away from glory..Yeah, right..
        Alright, what can you do with these systems??? In god mode you have
 the same rights as any employee who is doing their stuf legit. You can
 erase and add to data, buy yourself a concert ticket etc. You can have a lot
 of fun. Problem is, you can hardly ever get into the god mode. So we're
 with boring old Public mode. Fun can still be had with these...
        Here is a list of things to do whilst in public mode...

 Try pressing CNTRL and other keys...CNTRL D locks the terminal, CNTRL + gives
 you a calculator (I Think)

 Holding SHIFT and SETUP lets you modify the terminal. This is way cool. You
 can change the terminals language from English to German, Swedish, French
 etc. Try reading those menus in Italian!!!! Other things, such as key
 mappings can be modified. This is a very powerful part of the system for
 a public terminal.

 By going into the help sceens, pressing A to got additional help levels and
 C to change help levels, followed by the Password to change data, you can
 totally change the help screens. You can modify the headers, change the text
 etc. The same works for the Bulletin Board part of the system. By pressing BB
 to got this and then A, folowed by C you can change the public bulletin. You
 can do a lot of modifying for a crappy little public terminal with no rights.

 There are others, but my memory is fading. Experiment is the name of the game


        Well, I hope you enjoyed my little rant on this system. Anyone with
 further info can contact me and swap ideas. I'd love to hear feedback on this
 topic...Later D00dz...

 Section [3] - The Australian Telephone System
                - An ongoing saga for eleetness by Sen Goku

 Well, this issue I have very little to really say on the actual phone system
 itself. One thing I have to inform everyone about (Thanx Mistix) is that by
 dialling 1800 12 #### you can get connected to company computers. The ####
 are just any old four numbers. Try using a war dialler, I've got a couple
 if anyone needs them, just email me. I'm not sure what this is yet, but I
 suspect that we're either getting Telstra computers or this is some kind of
 network, similar to Tymnet (Maybe Auspac???).
        I've tried a few, and here's a couple that did something.

   1800 12 1212 gave me some carrier, but it was garbled. I suspect this is
                a fax machine for some reason.
   
   1800 12 0555 gave me a weird dial tone. It was really sped up. Weird...

   1800 12 2222 gave me another psycho dial tone....

   1800 12 4444 gave me International Free Calling. NO!! Don't get too
                excited 'cause you need a password. Think it was 3 nos.
                long..

   1800 12 5555 gave me a really cool AT&T disconnect message.

   I suggest you try this out. Soon as I get a decent modem I'll scan this
   prefix properly. I'm doing it by hand at the moment and have found a 
   lot of VMB Systems. I'm working on hacking some now so you can all
   call me and leave me a message for free....

        To make this issue and part of this issue bigger, I've included a
 phile I've had lying around for a while. Sorry, but I don't remember who
 gave it to me, who wrote it etc. Enjoy anyhow...



        How To Rip Off Pay Phones
        -------------------------

    Introduction.
    -------------

          Phone ripping is a great way to earn money and it is very
          flexible you can choose your own hours, work part time,
          full time or casual. And it is one of the few thefts that
          you can actuly do in public and not have to worry about
          people looking or not.(coin ripping only!) So where did it
          originate? well i believe i was one of the first in Melbourne
          to think of such a great money making venture. But i latter
          discovered that americans had been doing this since the 60's.
    
    Vocabulary
    ----------

          Motherload   :-   More than $25 from one phone.

          Motherloader :-   A phone that always produces $25 plus.

          Slow Flow    :-   Placing too many tisues in a box can
                            cause money to come out a little at a time.

          Jam or Jama  :-   When it is so full that money RAINS down
                            causing the door to close and jam shut !



     Slot Ripping
     ------------

          In order to know how to rip you must first know the coin
          return and its hazards. Here is a basic diagram of a coin
          slot shown on a view of the right side of box.
               ____                    _______
               |   \                  /      5
               |    \    catch       /       6
               | \   \   coins     /         3
                  \   \  here     /          3
                   \             /           3
                    \            \_          3
                     \            / <spikes  3
                      \                      3
              door >   \                     3
                        \                    3
                         \                   3
                          \                  3
                           \                 3
                            \                3
                                             3
                |\                          /
                | \     coin fall here    /
                |__>_____________________/




     Sorry about the basic drawing but i am sure you will get the idea.



     What You Need
     -------------


          Now before going to a box lets get organised you will need
          the following:-

                           1 box of tisues
                           1 piece of THIN wire (1.5 mm thick or less)
                           30 one cent coins
                           1 tac (or nail)
                           10 bandades


                                                    



     How Much Can be Made
     --------------------


          Find all the telephone boxes you can walk to (ride, drive to etc)
          and make i mental list it takes 10 phone boxes emptied 5 times
          a week to earn aprox $300 a week (give or take a little depending
          on where you live. i used to do woek at hungy jacks in the city,
          and was earning about 185 bucks an week at jacks and about 500
          bucks a week doing 8 boxes,4 times a week (so the money is good!)


     Doing The Job
     -------------


          Aproch the box as if you are going to make a call. This is not
          just so you dont look suspicous but it is an idea to test the phone
          by making a free call to the operator (in most phones the money will
          come back out) thus you know the phone is working, to save you the
          trouble of PAPERING a phone that does not work. If the phone works
          yet does not exept money then you are in luck you have found a
          phone that can make up to $82 in one day (max holding!!!) this
          phone is named a SLOT MACHINE ! but be carefull because they can
          easily turn into a MOTHERLOAD JAMA. ok so if all is ok you can then
          start inserting tisues into the coin slot. Place a few at a time
          and then push them up the slot (BUT NOT TOO FAR!!) test that there
          are no leaks by inserting four one cent coins down the slot. This
          is also good cause you can see if anyone has taken money from your
          phone and reset the tisues your 4 cents will be missing.


                 OK now is the really hard part. When you think it is just
          about time to collect your hard earned cash  use a bandade or 2
          and tape the tiny nail to your finger (This is helpful but if you
          have long fingers you can do it without) push you finger up the
          slot making sure it is against the left was if the coin slot
          (so you miss the small but sometimes NASTY little spike) Now
           scoop the paper down and there is your cash!!!


     Notes
     -----


          Some phones use a door like this    =============
          so that fingers can not put pushed    \         |
          up into the slot (thats where the      \        |
          thin wire comes in) bend the wire       \  |    |
          and place the paper up with it and       \==    |
          remove it the same way.                 ----------


          If you find a phone that is hard or
          imposable to do than just super
          glue the top so they have to use
          the phone that you HAVE papered!


          Never use telephone book paper!


  Well, I was doing this a couple of weeks ago, with some success. It takes
  a lot of practice and patience to get it to work properly. Whwn inserting
  the tissue paper, the door can get jammed semi-open. This is a giveaway.
  Fraud can net you a lot of money if done properly. I made about $50 in a
  week, problem was it was all in 20c coins etc. Real bitch....

 Section [4] - The criminal use of Fake ID
                - By Sen Goku

 Generic ID       
 ----------       
        
        Fake ID, for the average teenager has become increasingly necessary
 as we continue to grow up. Now with forms of prohibition, such as needing to
 be 18 to buy cigarettes, alcohol and the such fake identification goes a long
 way to contributing to our early deaths. As a hacker/phreaker we all know the
 problems with certain police knowing our true identities, so fake ID again
 comes into play by allowing us a certain freedom to hide our true identities.
        The normal teenager usually can procure, or knows someone who can
 procure Fake Identification for themselves. The producing of fake id's can be
 a lucrative business, as I know. During the past year I have produced an 
 estimated 30 fake ID's for friends, at a cost of $10 a pop. Now, with the 
 initial starting up fee of my small enterprise being $20, I have made a 
 reasonable profit. Anyone with some knowledge of computers can produce a 
 Fake ID.
        The real success to creating a usable fake ID is not what the actual
 ID is (But that helps, read on), but how professional the finished product
 looks. To produce a fake ID, it is handy to procure an actual real ID from
 someone and examine it, photo-copy it etc. Take exact measurements of every
 part of the ID so that you can draw it on screen with a graphics proggy...
        Measure the ID and then draw it on screen, and save it. It is 
 important to make the ID as reallistic as possible, using fonts and line 
 thicknesses that match the real ID. When drawing the ID is is importanat to
 copy it exactly. This cannot be stressed enough. When I was producing mine,
 I even went to the detail of drawing a barcode by HAND! on paintbrush...When
 this was printed out (It ws the back of the ID) it really made the ID's look
 real.Once the ID is produced on screen, it is advisable to print them out...
        When printing the ID, you must ensure that it is properly done. None
 of this printing with a dot-matrix. Sorry dudes, but only use a laser of
 bubble jet. A handy tip here, when printing via paintbrush click on the
 button called "Use Printer Resolution". This will print the ID at the highest
 resolution capable via the printer. You may have to redraw the ID but the
 results obtained by doing this on a Laser or Bubble Jet are amazing. The ID
 when printed at this resolution looks totally perfect, none of that computer
 look about it.
        With the front and back of the ID printed at the best the printer can
 do, it is now up to adding the professional touches. A good fake ID will 
 include a photo. Most places only accept photo ID's now, so a photo ID is the
 go. Go to a photography studio and get a set of passport photos. These are
 professional photo's for passports (Duh??). The only problem I have with them
 is that they are a fraction thick. To reduce this you can carefully splice
 the backing paper of the photo in half. Without damaging the photo ofcourse.
        To stick the ID together, you will need a glue that will not crease
 the actual ID by shrinking when it dries. I use a glue stick called UHU. It
 is an excellent choice for the fake ID manufacturer. It will stick the ID
 together, ready for laminating perfectly. It can also add the photo and other
 profesional touches with ease.
        The ID is nearly ready, but finishing touches need to be added. The
 real ID that you are copying will often have a sticker or similar on it for
 proof. This can be a real pain, but works. To fake the sticker, get a sheet
 of brightly coloured paper the same as the real sticker. Then print onto this
 the exact text of the sticker, and glue the fake sticker on. This part, when
 done properly really can bring an ID to life.
        No ID is complete without being laminated. This can be the worst part
 of the manufacturer and can bring many amatuers un-done. Goto a business
 supply shop and buy a box of laminate slips that are approx the size wanted.
 They can be expensive, eg $12 for 100. When the ID is fully assembled, slip
 it inside the laminate slip. To laminate the ID, you will need patience and
 maybe even assistance. Without access to a professional laminating machine, 
 I had to improvise. By placing a pillow case over the laminate, placing it
 on an ironing board and ironing it on the hottest my iron would go, whilst
 keeping a lot of weight on it, I was able to melt the laminate on. Now, to
 make the laminate job better and not so shitty, after I had finished ironing
 I grabbed a rolling pin and whilst the laminate was still hot, I rolled the
 ID with all my might. The rolling process smooths out the laminate and can
 really look good, but I suggest you practice a few times.
        ID's can be easily made by following the above. The problem is that
 now, due to people being able to make ID's easily a lot of places are 
 changing to drivers licence's only. These can still be faked, but are a lot
 harder to do.

 Drivers Licences
 ----------------

        These are the biggest bitches to fake, but are the most accepted of
 all ID. There are two real methods to fake a licence, which I shall explain.
        The easiest, and perhaps most successful way of getting a fake drivers
 licence is via this method. It involves carefully peeling the cover laminate
 away from the licence. If accomplished sucessfully, you know have the licence
 sans laminate. Changing the date of birth is about all you can do with this
 method. By carefully scratching off the last digit of the D.O.B you can
 change this with a pen. If done properly there is little evidence that the 
 licence has been changed. A laminate slip must then by placed over the ID
 and re-laminated as shown above.
        The second way to change a licence allows you to totally change
 everything, including the name and address. This is accomplished only if you
 have access to a very high tech PC with scanner and colour Ink Jet printer.
 The licence is scanned at the best resolution possible, so that there is no
 defects. The data is then changes on screen, and the licence printed out at
 the best possible resolution of the printer. This is then fixed onto a thin
 plastic cut-out (From an ice cream container) and re-laminated. This method
 is very hard to acheive any decent results, but decent results can be 
 amazing. I have personally never seen this done, but kids in Adelaide are
 allegedly doing it for a huge profit ($100 per licence).

 Conclusion
 ----------

        Well, as you can see, fake ID's require a lot of attention to detail
 if they are to be used successfully. Of the two methods, the drivers licence
 is the most accepted but is also the hardest to do properly. A semi decent
 ID that passes for most purchases, eg alcohol and cigarettes can be made
 really easily. The fake ID's manufactured from scratch will not however
 pass in the majority of night clubs anymore. To enter most clubs in Adelaide
 you now need a drivers licence because people have been getting busted using
 their ID's. Be smart about it people and you will have a successful carreer.

 One final note - Please don't try to purchase something using a Fake ID that
                  says you're from a Uni if you are wearing a high scholl
                  uniform. This is how I got busted. A total lame 
                  motherfucker tried to buy cigarettes in a school uniform
                  with a Uni ID. Real smart.....

 Section [5] - Hacking a VMB
                - By Sen Goku

        Inspired by recent scanning of 1800 nos. I decided to start hacking 
 the systems that I found. It is really hard to find information on this
 subject, giving neophytes a tiny starting base. In my short experiences I
 have learnt a lot about the telephone system here in the land of Oz and
 abroad. I have found plenty of VMB's during the past through days, the
 majority being in Amerika. I guess that it hasen't taken off in Australia,
 much the same as PBX's. Guess that's because we don't have too many huge
 multi-national companies???
        This information is not mine, and is culled from a variety of sources
 with credit being given when I have the authors name etc. Some of the shit
 has been lying on my hard disk for nearly a year so I'm sorry if I don't
 credit you for your text.


 Substance's Complete Guide To Hacking Meridian Mail Systems (VMB) [PART 1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb 1st, 1995  --Made for Phrack

Introduction To Meridian Mail Box Systems

By Substance @ Another Way of Life [hpavc] 518_383_1369

NOTE1: In case you didn't know VMB stands for Voice Mail Box

NOTE2: This is the information that I have gathered from hacking
       Meridians, and is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate

NOTE3: Disclaimer : There is none, I did this article to encourage people to
       go and fuck around with Meridians, so sue me.

------------
Introduction
------------

Before we begin, Let's shed a little light on the subject of Meridian.  This
is one of my favorite VMB systems to hack, because:

Number 1    : There are many Meridian VMB Systems throughout the country, in
--------      800 exchanges and numbers local to you. You can bet that there
              are at least 10 - 15 different corporations using Meridian
              throughout your area code

Number 2    : (The Most Important by far.)  Almost ALL Meridian mails
--------      use the Mail Box number as the default password. (Unless changed
              manually)

Number 3    : About 95 percent have outdialing features.  Most don't have long
--------      distance access, but this can still be very useful for diverting
              calls, and getting free calls in that area code.


Ok, enough light shed on the matter. Let's get to identifying and hacking
those fuckers!

--------------------------
Identifying Meridian VMB's
--------------------------

Most Meridian VMBs just come right out and say exactly what they are.  I'd
say about 8 out of 10 will just come out, right after it answers and say:

"MERIDIAN MAIL"
<wait 1 second>
"MAILBOX?"

or just

"MAILBOX?" (it is ALWAYS a female computer [digitized] voice)

Half the time you will only hear "RIDIAN MAIL". (This must be caused by
a timing bug in Meridian.)  Once you hear that, write the # down, since
it may be useful in the future for such things as 3rd party billing
(more on that later), as a code line or just as a personal VMB.  If you know
for a fact (or a guess in that matter) that this is a Meridian mailbox but
when you call it, it just says 'Leave a message' or has someone actually
talking instructing you to leave a message, then you have reached what might
be a direct VMB line. These are usually numbers people pay more money for, that
will give them a direct 800 number instead of going through the "mailbox #"
part.

These are the best, but probably the hardest to hack, because even though
(according to a recent poll) about 70% of people are stupid enough to leave
their mailbox number as their password, if you are serious and want to
pay that much for a direct line, you are probably going to change the
password. Even though I have seen many that do have the default, the
odds are against it.

Ok back to the point.  If you find a direct VMB, call all the numbers around
it, because chances good are that you will find the system that just asks
for a box number, very close.  I would recommend about +50 numbers and -50
numbers and you'll find the root system.  You will also find many other
direct boxes in your quest.

NOTE: The ROOT SYSTEM is the number you call and simply hear 'MAILBOX' or
      'MERiDiAN MAiL'

Another thing to remember is that you have to find out how many digits your
mailbox #'s are going to be.  The number of digits I've seen in my career
differs from about 2 digits (rare) to 6 (also fairly rare).  The most likely
# of digits it will probably have is 4, or 5...  Call your VMB and when it asks
for mailbox #, hit '111#' (Note: You ALWAYS have to end a command on a Meridian
mail system with an '#') if it says (with a quick response) 'INVALID box #'
then try a 4 digit code.  Sometimes (yeah, I know it sucks) you will
have to fuck around for a while before you can tell how many digits, or even
worse you may never know, and have to keep alternating #'s of digits, until
you hit a valid box.

Hacking The Fuckers:

First off, think of what you are going to record as an outgoing message before
you go and hack it.  Decide if this should be a code line, or a personal VMB,
or... Both?  Here are the first default boxes you should try before dialing
random ones:

111 222 333 444 555 666 777 888 999 000 100 200 300 400 500
600 700 800 900 123 234 345 456 567 678 789 890 901 121 212
etc. etc. etc.

If boxes are 4 digits, add a trailing number.  If you don't know the length,
mess around a while, you'll get one.

If you call someone's direct VMB and you hear a message like "You have
reached So&So's VMB please leave a message, and I will return your call as
soon as possible" there are a few ways to transfer to a different mailbox.
Try simply hitting #, that might just hang up on you, unfortunately.
Call back try hitting *.  When you hear 'MAiLBOX' you just struck home.
Try entering 123#.

Now, a few things can happen. Either:

        1  It will transfer you to 123's mailbox
        2  It will say invalid mailbox, or simply 'MAILBOX' again
        3  It will say Password

When you hear 123's mailbox you can try and hack it by hitting *, and hope
it will ask 'PASSWORD?'  If it doesn't then you can't do much with this
system except leave messages for that person (What Fun).  If it does ask
"PASSWORD?" then try the box # as the default password.  (On your quest for a
valid VMB you will find that MANY MANY people are total fucking morons
and keep their password at the default) others will make it something easy to
remember like 123# or 111# etc. etc. etc.  If the password is not the Default
then just write this number down in a notebook and move on.

If all else fails and you can't figure out how to get to the MAILBOX prompt you
should call all the #s around the one you found to try and find the root
system.


If you get in, (with the default or otherwise) it will probably say:

'MAILBOX EMPTY' or 'YOU HAVE n MESSAGES'

If you press 7* it will reply with:

Message option 0        (unknown at this time)
Reply 1                 (used to reply to a previous message)
Play envelope 2         (unknown at this time)
Forward 3               (Forward your mail to another box)
Reply all 4             (Reply with a multi-mail)
compose 5               (send multi-mail)
delete 6                (used to delete mail [duh])
send 9                  (sends single mail [must have mailbox number ready)


if you press 8* it will reply with:

Mailbox options 0       (Changes operator code (not useful)
login 1                 (Gives you the option to transfer mailbox's)
greeting 2              (Can change greeting (internal & external)
logoff 3                (Kicks you off the system)
password change 4       (Changes VMB password [verifies 2x]
distribution list 5     (Not useful)
goto 6                  (Takes you back to 'MAILBOX EMPTY'
Personal verification 9 (Lets you record a name for personal verify)
to exit press #         (logoff)

This is not all very useful, the most you can do with these commands is listen
to people's mail (which can be fun), and/or take it over for your own code line
or personal VMB.  The whole point of hacking Meridians is the outdial function.
Once you have successfully gotten into the VMB dial '0*' (Zero-Star).
It should say:

'YOU HAVE REACHED A SYSTEM THAT WILL CONNECT YOU TO THE NUMBER THAT YOU ENTER.
PLEASE ENTER THE NUMBER OR THE NUMBER OR THE NAME OF THE PERSON YOU WISH TO
REACH. PRESS 11 FOR A NAME, SPELL THE LAST NAME THEN THE FIRST NAME blah,
blah, blah.'

This is the jackpot.  With this you can call ANYWHERE (hopefully) for free, any
time (unless the VMB has hours [...some do...]) To dial out, try this first:

just dial a local number (ex 432-1342#)

>From there it may beep and say 'THAT # CANNOT BE REACHED' or it may connect
you.  If it connects you, great!  You just found an untraceable way of hacking!
Call back and try 1-npa/xxx-yyyy (if that works, then abuse the hell out of it
as soon as possible, because it wont last for long :) )  If those two methods
don't work try these.

                            9+1+npa/xxx-yyyy  (works most of the time)
                            8+1+npa/xxx-yyyy  (not probable)
                            0+1+npa/xxx-yyyy  (Possible)
                            9+xxx-yyyy
                            8+xxx-yyyy
                            0+xxx-yyyy

If none of those work, then you're shit out of luck. Use it for a code line.
If it did work, think of the possibilities, 900 numbers (for gaining access
to boards), Tons of free LD, untraceable calls............

On to the last subject of part 1.

------------------------------
Another Way To Make Free Calls
------------------------------

Sorry, this only works on Direct VMB's, sometimes only the ones in your local
exchange, its a long shot, but hell, its free.  (But don't do this from your
home phone, stupid.)

Change the outgoing message on the direct VMB to 'Operator, this number accepts
all collect and 3rd party billings'  Call up the operator and ask for AT&T,
once they come on tell her you would like to make a 3rd party billing.  Tell
her the number you're billing to is the VMB #, then tell her the number you
wish to call. She'll say, "wait," AND a few moments later she'll come back
and say they accepted.  Presto!  You're in!

If you get busted, say you read a text file on how to do it, you didn't think
it would work... (act innocent, alwayz worked for me :)


You can leave me comments, suggestions or threats at my VMB
(not a Meridian currently)  *(800)775-0728* (direct)...

Addendum
--------

        I have been experimenting with a meridian just today. I discovered
that when asked for your mail box no. pressing 199 will send you to the
menu that gives you the prompt

Meridian Mail
Mailbox?

        With the system that I was cracking I have had trouble in cracking
the mailbox codes. The boxes are three number combinations but I'm unsure
of the passwords. The defaults don't seem to work.....

  Section [6] - Wicked Net Sites
                - Compiled by Sen Goku on my journies

        As members of the Australian h/p community we have little access to
 information that exists elsewhere due to the fucking isolation of this
 country. With the Internet becoming hugely popular, we can now get access
 to sites with interesting information relatively easily. Here are a few that
 I have found interesting in my trips.


 ftp.hyperreal.com in the drugs sub-directory. Complete synthesis details of
                                               chemical substances.

 ftp.2600.com - I got a cool ethernet sniffer from here to fuck around with
                my schools Novell network.

 http://www.l0pht.com - A really c00l hacker site. I went to download some
                        info on Auspac and got some warning saying that I
                        couldn't due to it being restricted by CERT or some
                        other crap like that.

 ftp.eff.org - This is pretty lame. It only carries the older stuff....

 ftp.freeside.com - I got Phrack #47 from here. Not bad...


        These should get you all started. I've got some more, but I'm still
 trying to find my notes. Sorry dudez...

 Section [7] - The results of some 1800 12 #### scanning.

        This is my results from some scanning of this set of numbers. My 
 method was to dial 1800 12 3030,3130,3230 etc. in  progression up to 9898.
 This gave me a set of numbers, with the majority connecting to something.
 The results are summarized below.

 Carrier Detected
 ----------------

 1800 12 6464 - This gave me a carrier and no real response when dialled with
                a modem.

 1800 12 3737 - When dialled via a modem I got

        Carrier: 300

        Protocol: None

    Followed by shit....

 1800 12 9898 - This one was fucking weird. I got a strange dial tone, and
                when this dial tone was going, I found that by pressing 
                8 # and 8 * in order I could get a carrier spat back at me.

 Voice Mail Boxes
 ----------------

 1800 12 9292 - This was a persons private answering machine. Dunno why it
                was in this prefix, but I could play around with it a bit
                by experimenting with #1,#2,#3 etc.

 1800 12 5252 - Not sure about this one.

 1800 12 5656 - A US VMB I think.

 1800 12 4141 - Cable Tron. A US company.

 Weird Tones and Stuff
 ---------------------

 1800 12 6565 - A nip voice going totally insane!!

 1800 12 7676 - Voice Com????

 1800 12 8585 - Nips again

 1800 12 8686 - Italian I think....

 1800 12 9696 - Weird tones

 1800 12 3636 - Not sure...

        I'm deliberately keeping some of this stuff to myself so that no-one
 fucks up some of the c00l stuff I've found. A heap of numbers gave me a
 message to dial again in a few minutes because the call could not be 
 connected. These must all be overseas companies or something like that.
        I suggest anyone who is interested in the above numbers do some 
 scanning yourselves. I'm definately interested in what anyone else finds.

 Section [8] - Underground News #2

 Russian Hackers raid CitiBank
 -----------------------------
        Last year Russian Hackers stole more than $10 million from Citibanks
 electronic money transfer system. A Citibank spokesperson said that all but
 $400 000 has been recovered, but that Citibank now requires customers to use
 and electronic password generator for every transfer. The hackers 34 year old
 ringleader was arrested in London three months ago and is now awaiting 
 extradition to the U.S

 Telstra admits call monitoring
 ------------------------------
        David Ranft, Manager of International Network Quality for Telstra has
 admitted that Telstra was monitoring calls to determine which calls were
 data, voice or fax. It was all in the name of optimizing the fibre optic
 networks, Mr Ranft said.

 Australia to ban encryption software
 ------------------------------------
        At a conference in July, Steve Orlowski, Assistant Director of the 
 Attorney General Department stated that the majority of people did not
 need strong cryptography. He said that law enforcement agencies could develop
 the capabilities to attack low level encryption and that criminals purchasing
 higher level encryption would attract attention to themselves.
