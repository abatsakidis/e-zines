 Section [1]: Editorial


        Well, here it is...My dream has come true...The Australians now have 
 their very own mag to compete with the US invasion....
        This is the first issue of what I hope will be a big thing here both
 in Australia and worldwide!! We need support and submissions from you, the
 Australian and New Zealand Phreakers and Hackers...Please, if you are one
 of the very few of us, get in touch. We need to all band together to totally
 understand the glorious nature of our phone and computer systems.
        I've taken the liberty of doing the huge majority of the work for
 this issue. I can't keep this up for ever (School calls..) so I'm 
 distributing this everywhere in the hope that everyone who reads this will
 be able to help out with contributing articles for future issues...
        We can't survive forever without help from the Phreak/Hack community
 and if we go, so does the voice of the Down Under scene..The scene in this
 country has the potential to be absolutely huge. I read somewhere that it
 is predicted that the worlds best hackers will soon emerge from Australia, 
 Britain and Israel. Lets prove them right!!

 Section [2]: Hacking KFC - Killer Chickens Run Rampage!!
                - By Sen Goku

 PART 1 - Hacking a Collectro

        KFC, love it or hate it...Here in our hometown it's the only major
 fast food place...(Well, for 6 months or so). Hence, the majority of the
 towns youth population work there, so people are able to get certain bits
 of information when they become good enough at social engeneering the
 managers (Te He!).
        The Original Recipie chicken , along with fillets and Hot And Spicy
 are all cooked in big hot pressure cookers called Collectro-matics. Yay!!
 Well, these machines are all controlled by little computers that tell the
 machine when to release some steam, how long to cook and when the chicken
 is ready (Usually when you're chatting up a chick! Doh!). Believe it or
 not but these little babies cost approx. $5 000 for one tiny little
 computer. Don't get those suckers wet....
        Because the menus are constantly changing, how the chicken is cooked
 also changes regularly, so the machines need to be re-programmed. Now, 
 there's definately no GUI here. These things are a real cunt to reprogram
 hence the majority of reprogramming is done by managers who talk on the
 phone to a guy in head office who tells them what to do. They then shout
 across the store to the unluckly person who gets to press the buttons.
        Access to the computers is hidden, often with passwords!! Don't
 forget that this is still on the cookers!! Yes, they have hidden features
 and buttons, and even PASSWORDS! Now, I'm not sure how the password features
 go 'cause I never had much of a go at reprogramming the machines. I beleive
 that they are just numbers, entered via a combination of buttons.
        One method of reprogramming these machines is listed now. I don't 
 have a manual, so I'll just have to rely on my memory and notes I took when
 I got home. Sue me if I'm wrong, but if anyone has access to a 6 head 
 collectro and can verify this then please drop me a line.

              -------------------------------------------------

        Thats a basic diagram of the control panel of the collectro. I
 haven't been able to verify the accuracy because I aren't working for
 four days so I'm working from memory.
        Now, to use the machine you press the number of head button you
 require (eg. 2 head press button labeled 2, 6 head press 6 etc.) and then
 heat the machine up by pressing Exit/Cool. That's how to get the temperature
 up to drop temperature. The Cook Time panel is a 6 digit LCD screen that
 displays the oil temperature, cook time remaining and various other goodies.
        To take a read in the morning before the store open you hold down
 Scan and the hidden button next to Temp. This allows you to cycle through
 how much chicken has been cooked on this machine since new oil was added
 (Oil is changed approx. every 500 head) by pressing Scan. The LCD screen
 will display a number and that is the amount of chicken this machine has
 cooked (eg 345 is 345 head of chicken where 1 head = 9 pieces).
        When new oil is added the counter must be reset so that the readings
 will be correct. The counter is reset by holding Scan and the hidden button
 next to Temp as before. You then cycle to the number of head cooked with Scan
 and then pressing Exit/Cool will reset the counter to zero.
        Now to the fun bit, reprogramming the machine. WARNING - THIS IS VERY
 DANGEROUS. IMPROPER USE COULD RESULT IN EXPLOSION AND DEATH. But, apart from
 that I suggest you just hack the machine and see what happens.
        Holding Scan and Temp produces a four digit number. I don't have a 
 clue what the relevance of this number or what pressing any other buttons
 whilst this number is displayed will do. Experiment....I was too busy to
 try to hack the machine, plus, stuffing it up doesn't look good to a manager.
        There is another hidden button next to Scan. I believe that holding
 this down along with the other hidden button allows for the machine to be
 reprogrammed. I can't confirm this because I've gone and lost the notes I
 took after I witnessed this great hack...FUCK!! This allows you to totally
 change everything relating to the machine. You can change cooking 
 temperature, time taken, pressure used etc. Use this feature to create your
 favourite chicken, burn the stuff to a crisp etc.
        Sorry, but Hacking the Collectro was supposed to be longer. I just
 tried to look for my notes on how to do it and they're gone...Vapourised
 I'd say... FUCK FUCK FUCK......Ah well, I'll have another look and If they
 turn up I'll put more in ISSUE 2!!!

  PART 2 - Door Entry Codez

        If you go to your local KFC and wander around the store you're bound
 to find the door where all the staff enter. This door will lead into the
 store, allowing access to all those hidden areas behind the counter. If you
 are able to get in and wander you will find all sorts of goodies such as
 collectro-matics to hack, computers (IBM compats.) to link to head office,
 free food and drinks, people who are about to arrest you for trespass and hot
 chicks(Females, not food.)
        Now, you are all wondering, how can I get access to such wonders???
 Well, you could get a job at your local store (Yeah right!) or you could try
 to enter just like the staff do. If you check out the staff entry you will
 most probably see a combination puch button lock that allows access. If you
 were going real low-tech then you could just follow a staff member through,
 but we don't want to go low-tech. We want to crack the combination.
        Whenever you go to crack a combination lock you should first think
 about what level of security is required for the plack where the lock is. Now
 the local KFC is low security which means easy combinations. The local phone
 exchange is high security so this means hard combinations (I once saw an
 employee enter the combination to our local exchange. Pity it was 2 years 
 ago!). Because of the dopes that are employed in a fast food restaraunt the
 combination will be relatively simple to find out.


                                  ----------
                                 -          -
                                 -  A     1 -
                                 -  B     2 -
                                 -  C     3 -
                                 -  D     4 -
                                 -  E     5 -
                                 -  F     + -
                                  ----------
        
        Thats a basic diagram of the combination lock. The recommended KFC
 combination pattern is Letter + 5 Numbers. From this we can see that if the
 pattern is hard to remember then the dopey employees will forget it. Hence
 the patterns are nearly always one of the letters + 12345 or variations on
 that theme. N-JOI


 PART 3 - Daily Reports

        All of the stores are linked to the main Headquarters to allow for
 daily sales to be polled by the HQ. This link is via IBM PC's with modems
 who, upon the managers instruction receive the data from the POS terminals
 and then upload them to the HQ computer system. Other features such as
 E-Mail between stores are avaliable also. I can't verify too much of this
 because of the fact that we are'nt allowed near the PC anymore since someone
 spilt coffee into the Fax. Such is life....
        Before I give you all a suspected dialup (Not verified yet) I'll tell
 you all how to get one. Once you have gained entry into the store head into
 the office. In this office will be the phones, PC, Safe, Fax etc... You will
 also notice a list stuck to the wall somewhere. This lists all of the contact
 numbers of Staff and other relevant people. On this list will be a phone
 number and conveniantly next to that will be a password. This is what I 
 believe to be the HQ.
        Alright, you all say, but we haven't got access to this list. Well try
 the following at your own risk and please don't get caught

 Ph - 008 812 857
 Login - ?????
 Password - Tenderroast

Addendum - I just dialled this number and got an Op. I suggest you handle this
with care.....

 Section [3]: The Australian Phone System
                - By Sen Goku

        The Australian Telephone network is very hostile towards phreakers and
 phreaking in general. Until recently we only had the one carrier Telecom, now
 called Telstra to play around with. With deregulation (10 years behind the
 rest of the world) we now have Optus for long distance and Vodafone for
 mobile comms. Soon more companies are expected to play the Australian market
 with the deregualtion of local calls. This can only give hope to the future
 Australian computer underground.
        Unlike American(and the rest of the world) Australian telephones are
 DC, unlike AC phones. In AC phones tones (such as the infamous 2600Hz) are
 used to signal call completion, but here in Australia we just drop the ground
 (negative side of the line) to hang up. This means that we can't just shoot
 frequencies down the line to unlock the trunk. I haven't experimented too
 much with the hanging up of Aust phones, but if we could fool the pay phone
 into beleiving that the ground had been dropped then I beleive that we could
 make free calls.....
        Hang on, all three of the Australain phreakers yell out! But you can
 use tones. Well I'm not to sure on this bit of info. It came from a rather
 dubious source. According to my information people were using those little
 black answering machine tone diallers to enter a code that unlocked 
 international lines and removed all ISD charges. This is all of the info I
 have so can someone please help out here???
        I recently got my hands on the AXE data manual which I beleive is the
 manual for my local telephone exchange. Now as my phreaking knowledge is
 limited I can't understand too much. From the manual however I was able to
 work out some of the following

 Prefixing a NO with 19001 will allow you to test the line

 and here goes

 Code 997 is to be introduced into the network as an access code for testing
 R.V.A's(???). To carry out these tests dial 997 + the R.V.A number.
 eg. 997001 to test R.V.A.1

        000-997,F=99,M=3
        099-001,RC=1,CC=1,L=3,D=11-0
        RC=1,BR=90,PA=1,RVA=1
                  ,PA=2,RVA=17
             BR=10,PB=1,RVA=17
                  ,PB=2,Rva=1


 I can send anyone who wants one a copy of the AXE data manual. It's a windows
 help file. Just send me some email and I'll send it back to you.
        As I'm sure you all noticed our phreaking knowledge is very limited.
 We used to steal card numbers and use those until they got busted by the
 narcs. We racked up a couple thousand dollar bill to the Army...
        Anyone with a knowledge of the Australian phone system, please get in
 touch with me because we need someone to write for us with a great deal of
 knowledge. We can use this knowledge to inform the other Australians out
 there who are interested but can't find out how to begin.
 
 D00dz - A late addition. This is pretty lame stuff but....

        Dial 199 for ringback
        Dial 19123 for ANI (Automatic Number Identification)

 Section [4]: Panic Time - What to do when the cops come knocking..
                -By Sen Goku
                
THE GUIDE TO THE YOUNG CRIMINAL ACCUSED OF USING COMPUTERS

 PART 1 - Getting Busted

     With the hyperactivity of law enforcement officials and the current
attitudes of the public in general, it is probably time to consider what to
do in case of a bust.  I would guess that just about everybody reading
this issue has violated some sort of law somewhere in
someone's mind involving computers.  This is not to say that all the
readers of this publication are really criminals -- just that the laws are
so broadly interpreted so as so make anyone with a modem a criminal.  For
example, if you have ever downloaded shareware and not used it, but didn't
delete it, and had it for over 15 days, you could be violating copyright
laws if the author put some sort of announcement to the effect that such
were the terms of agreement.  This means that you could very well be raided
someday.
     
     There may be warning signs.  You could get a call or a preliminary
visit from a member of the Police, a call from security from Telstra
 a visit from a local policeman, news that someone you know has been busted.

     I would hardly advise anybody to destroy evidence since that is a
crime itself, but it would seem to me that at this point a lot of material
you have had around the house has been bringing you bad luck.  A lot of
paper and printouts are a definite fire hazard and should not be left lying
around.  Also, old data never does you any good -- it would be wise to
format most of your ala disks several times.  Better yet, treat yourself to
some new ones and maybe your luck will change.  All those old, dusty disks
simply clutter things up.  It's time to reorganize.

     The search warrant usually takes a while to get, but most judges take
the path of least resistance and will issue one on fairly flimsy grounds.
Now you must realize that most police officers are not used to dealing with
computer people and that they do not like the ones they do have to deal
with at work.  The are used more to searches in the case of narcotics,
illegal weapons, etc.  You can not expect them, then, to be overly polite
when they do knock on your door.  Do not let this frighten you into telling
them all sorts of things.  During the search, however, it helps to have
someone there crying.  Also, act limply, as if you have lost the will to
live.  This will usually placate the more professional ones who should
realize thereby that you are not going to shoot at them.  This behavior is
simply designed to keep you from being beaten or otherwise abused.  It does
not help your case legally although, if they do beat or otherwise try to
intimidate you, and you can document it, a prosecutor will feel less
exuberant about taking the case to court.

     They will probably place you under arrest at this point, reading you
your rights.  Once they do, you are under no obligation to say anything,
but I would advise you to say "I want an lawyer." 
     You can respond to their "good guy" questions about the
weather and such, but then when the questions come back to the topic of
computers you had best repeat the above sentence(s).  In fact, the more
times you say it the better if it ever gets to court, but do not say it
gratuitously so as to arouse the macho defensiveness that some officers may
have.  Realize that the arresting officer is not a legal scholar and that
he is no more culpable in this arrest than is the postman for bringing you
a bill.  The real fighting lies ahead.  One final point:  it is wise to
become acquainted with an attorney before any of this happens.  One thing
is quite certain: nothing you say to the arresting officers is likely to
help your case.

     While they are carrying out your computer, your floppies, your
printouts, your telephones, your answering machine, your radio, your tapes,
note what they take. You want your stuff back don't you?

     From here on, the case should be in the hands of a competent lawyer.
It is not necessary that he be an expert in computers since the prosecutor
isn't either and the police even less so.  The odds are that you will be
able to supply more than enough computer expertise.   What is important is
his willingness to fight the case.  Most will take that path of least
resistance, perhaps working toward a plea bargain.  The trouble with that
is you are not in the best position at this point for a plea bargain.  One
of you main strategies should be to make the case so much of a pain in the
ass for the prosecutor that he tires of it.  If the charge is a
misdemeanor, be advised that prosecutors do not like to prosecute such
cases in the first place.  The charge was made a misdemeanor in the hopes
that you would simply plead guilty and that would be an end of it.  It
would also be the last you ever saw of your equipment. 

     Finally, there is an old maxim to the effect that you should not lie
to your lawyer.  It is also true that it helps to have an lawyer who
believes in your case and is willing to fight it at every point, even
points that seem to you quit irrelevant.  When and how much to tell him is
a tricky issue.  Remember, he is good friends with the judge and the
prosecutor, but he is also quite interested in winning cases for his
clients.  It is also wise to arrange some sort of set fee for the entire
case so that you feel more comfortable communicating with him.  One thing
you should communicate is the outcome you wish to see from the trial and he
should also make clear to you what your options are.  For example, it is
more difficult for a prosecutor to convince a jury that you are guilty.  He
doesn't even know that much about computers -- imagine him trying to
educate others.  On the other hand, if he succeeds. and the jury recommends
jail time, the judge is more likely to impose it.  On the other hand, a
judge might be easier to convince, but he would feel much more free to
suspend sentence and order "restitution."  You have to decide what risks
you are willing to incur in search of the desired outcome.

     I hope this hasn't sounded too frightening and I hope some of it might
be helpful to someone out there.  All I can say right now is that it is a
good time for people with computers to make friends with people with law
degrees.

 PART 2 - Prevention     
     
     Okay, so that deals with getting busted. Now, how to stop those fuckin
cops right in their tracks.
     If you seriously believe that you are about to be busted then it is time
to start some serious cleaning up of your bedroom. Believe me, it's not a fun.
At the moment I live in fear of a bust so my system and my room are now
as clean as ever. Problem is, what happens if the cops can de-encrypt my
stuff. Doubt it...
     Your bedroom is the easiest place to search for incriminating evidence.
Just take a look around. I'm sure you'll find printouts and other related
stuff just lying around.
     Okay, you should routinely look at the files stored on your system and
destroy the not so relevant but illegal files. I mean destroy. Delete them,
Defrag your hard drive, use a wipe disk proggy. Really get rid of them.
     Now, we all have files that we can not get rid of. These files are too
unique to get rid of. Now as they are deemed illegal by some stupid fools we
are not allowed to possess them. Encryption is the answer.
     Care must be taken when using an encryption program. No-one is ever
fully sure if the encryption is safe. I zip up my files with a password and
then run a PGP conventional encryption using a large password, which consists
of both letters and numbers and is not in the dictionary. I seriously believe
that this system is unbreakable by Australian police. I doub't they'd have
the computing power to break that encryption. The only letdown of my system
is the fear of the police somehow finding my password.
     Once your files are encrypted you must take care to make the file names
innocuous. It is no good to call a file PEDO.PGP. It is pretty obvious what
this file is. Rename it to someting like PACMAN.EXE.
     To finish off my system security I use a combination of password controls
I use the BIOS password and a config.sys security program to provide a double
layer of password security. Obviousely these can be bypassed with relative
ease but it sure as hell would screw any computer illiterate cop up.
     Now that the system is secure look around your room and the house. I'm
sure that you'll find copious amounts of illegal things. Whilst cleaning my
room I discovered that the majority of my stuff could be called illegal. Damn
     Once the cops come knocking at your door they can legally seize any
electronic equipment they please. They will take everything they can find that
could incriminate you. You must hide all of your illegal printouts, books and
disks. I suggest you gather it all up and take a little visit to your grandma.
Now, grandma loves it when you visit so leave her a little present hidden in
her house. Oh, I'm sure you can find a reasonable enough hiding spot.
     With all of your stuff hidden and encrypted you might want to throw some
stuff away. Now, hackers are good at trashing and we all know what can be 
found via trashing so DESTROY all stuff before discarding. Shred paper, zap
disks with magnets and then cut them up. Do this and you'll be okay...

 SECTION [5] - The Manufacture of Plastique
               - Typed By Sen Goku

Plasique Explosive from Bleach

This explosive is a Potassium chlorate explosive.  This explosive and
explosives of similar composition were used in WWI as the main explosive
in grenades, land mines, and morter rounds used by French, German, and some
other forces involved in that conflict.  These explosives are relatively safe
to manufcture.  By RELATIVELY SAFE, I mean just that!  DON'T SCREW AROUND WITH
THIS SHIT, EITHER MAKE IT OR DON'T!  I hate to hear of a phreak buying it
because he was fucking with some chemicals and the blew up in his face.  The
procedures in the following paragraph CAN BE DANGEROUS, if you don't take
special care, and watch what you are doing!  On should strive to make sure
these explosives are free from sulfure, sulfides, and picric acid.  The
presence of these compounds result in mixtures that are or can become highly
sensitive and possibly decompose explosively while in storage.  One should
never store home made explosives, make enough for what you need at the time.
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW STABLE IT IS UNTIL IT BLOWS!  The manufacter of this
explosive from bleach is given just as an expediant method.  This method of
manufacturing potassium chlorate is not economical due to the amount of energy
used to boil the solution and cause the "Dissociation" reaction to take place.
The procedure does work and yields a relatively pure and a sulfur sulfide free
product.  These explosives are very cap sensitive and require only a cap for
instigating detonation.  To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach, (5.25%
sodium hypochlorite solution), obtain a heat source, hot-plate, stove, etc.,
etc.  a battery hydrometer, a large pyrex or enameled steel container, (to
weigh chemicals), and some potassium chloride, (sold as salt substitute).  Take
one gallon of bleach and place it in the container and begin heating it.  While
this solution heats, weigh out 63 grams potassium chloride and add this to the
bleach being heated.  Bring this solution to a boil and boil until when checked
with a hydrometer the reading is 1.3, (if battery hydrometer is used, it should
read FULL charge.) When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in
the refrigerator until it is between room temperature and 0 degrees celcius.
Filter out the crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution
again and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.  Take these crystals
that have been saved and mix them with distilled water in the following
proportions:  56 grams per 100 milileters distilled water.  Heat this solution
until it boils and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals
the form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called fractional
crystalization.  these crystals should be relatively pure potassium chlorate.
Power these to the consistancy of face powder and heat gently to drive off all
moisture.  Melt five parts vaseline and five parts wax.  Disslove this in white
gasoline, (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 90 parts potassium
chlorate, (the powdered crystals from above), in a plastic bowl.  Knead this
liquid into the potassium chlorate until intimately mixed.  Allow all the
gasoline to evaporate.  Place this explosive in a cool dry place.  Avoid
friction, sulfur, sulfides, and phophorous compounds.  This explosive is best
molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3 grams in a cube and dipped in
wax till water proof.  These block type charges guarantee the highest
detonation velocity.

 SECTION [6] - Underground News Report #1

 COMPUTER INTERNET PEDOPHILES BUSTED 27/7/95
 Source - The Today Show News (BBC news production)

 Today in England police have cracked down on people using the Internet for 
alleged spreading of so called "Child Porn". These men had all of their
computers confiscated and are waiting to be charged on numerous offences.
 These men were all involved in the swapping of child pornography for various
reasons, mainly their enjoyment. What I really want to know, is why crack
down on these people. All they were doing was looking at some pictures. If
anything, why not crack down on the sick cunts that are roaming the streets,
looking for young boys and girls to molest. These are the people we need to
worry about, not the people who just look at the stuff.


 FACTOTUM BOOKS RAIDED 20/7/95
 Source - Letter to people on Mailing List

 On the 5th July Australian Federal police and Customs, in liason with
the S.A police have raided Factotum books. Factotum specialise in sicko books
such as serial killers, etc. The stuff they sell is strange. The police 
raided in their never ending attemp to bust Adelaides child porn ring. they
accused factotum of being part of this and now it looks bleak for Factotum.
 Anyone who has had any dealings with Factotum is advised to hide their stuff
for a while.
