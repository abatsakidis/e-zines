        Well unfortunately the first issue of the               Editor
Alternateen Digest did not make it out on it's               John Yatsko 
originally planned release date. A lot has been           (yatjoh16@pct.edu)
going on since the first idea to release a magazine      (atd@unix.gcomm.com)
like the ATD. Contribution from the music industry                           
has been scarce. However, I would like to deeply            Senior Writers
that Howie Klein and Jim Baltutis at Reprise Records         Brian Jones
for helping me out in just about any way possible.        (dagmar@onix.com)
                                                         Dan (Deacon) Daidone
        A lot of thought has gone into the format of      (dagmar@onix.com)
the magazine since day one. We are thinking of 
making this magazine into a total print magazine.         Alternateen Digest
That way we would be able to be more creative with      Iss 1, Vol 1, Oct. 95
that format and include pictures among other things.      B-309, 101 Park St
Also we are hopefully going to have the ATD on a web    Williamsport, PA 17701
site sometime soon. So either way, this primitive           Local Aria Inc.
format we have now will probably be gone.

        The Filter and Silverchair album reviews are missing because we 
believe they have been outdated since the original add to the release of the 
magazine. Sorry if it caused any inconvenience.

        Local Aria Inc., the company that owns the Alternateen Digest, is 
sponsoring and possibly promoting a local unsigned band show to be held at
Pennypack Park in Philadelphia. If you are interested in possibly performing 
at this show, please get in contact with a staff member of the ATD. More 
information will be posted on the event as it becomes available.

        One final note. If you have an unsigned band or know of an unsigned
band that would like some publicity, get in touch with us either via email
or the U.S. Postal service. Both addresses are listed above. 

        Thank you for you time and I hope you enjoy the first issue of the
Alternateen Digest.                             
                                                John Yatsko

Unsigned: Bad Hat
by John Yatsko

   "To quote "Deathtongue," we want: "Chicks, chicks, chicks, and dough.""  
   
        In our neverending search for unsigned bands, we found the Bensalem, 
Pennsylvania based band Bad Hat. The band was nice enough to take time out of 
their practice session to sit down and answer a few questions that I emailed 
to one of the members that runs a bulletin board system, which can be 
contacted at 215-943-1885, and is the Official Bad Hat Fan Club Headquarters.

        Bad Hat consists of Bill Hottenstein, vocals, Jim McCloskey, guitar, 
Mike Harrison, drums, and Joe DeLucas, bass. All the band members are in their 
early twenties and claimed to have met in a parking lot. The group has been 
together off and on for about a year and a half. Last year they put out their 
first demo, which was a four song demo entitled "Dinner With Bob", that they 
call a "do-it-yourself trailer." One of the songs on the demo won an award 
from "Out On The Town" magazine for Best Song of 1994, Honorable Mention.

        Some of the bands influences are Monty Python, Ethel Merman, Marty 
Feldman, and The Beatles. Interestingly enough, all the members of the band, 
excluding Mike, have written lyrics to at least one of the songs on the demo. 
These guys love to play out, but don't seem to get as many gigs as they would 
like to. Some times they are asked to play all cover gigs, which they hate to 
do but is better than nothing. Some of the covers they do include: Fire by 
Jimi Hendrix, Everything Zen by Bush, Helter Skelter by The Beatles, Blister 
In The Sun by Violent Femmes, and Killing The Name by Rage Against The 
Machine, just to name a few. Bad Hat assures me that their contact with any
record company is "nothing to write home about." The lack of gigs and record
deals may have some to do with the terrible management or total lack of
management the group has had. They are looking for new management to this day.
Hopefully the will get a break because they seem to have a tremendous deal of 
talent.

Album Reviews: CIV, Foo Fighters, Hum, The Presidents Of The U.S.A., Sweet
Diesel, & Tripping Daisy
by Various Staff Members

Artist: CIV                     Album: Set Your Goals

Album Comments: Following in the foot steps of SICK OF IT ALL, CIV is the
                newest addition to the New York Hardcore scene with their
                debut album SET YOUR GOALS.

Song: Set Your Goals                    Rating: 4
Comments: They couldn't have picked a better song to begin the album. It has 
          a poppy rhythm and a beat you can snap your fingers to.

Song: Do Something                      Rating: 3
Comments: The distorted guitars have a QUICKSAND feel to it and the pace 
          varies from quick to very quick. Could have be longer.
            
Song: So Far So Good So What            Rating: 3
Comments: Though not as fast paced as some of their other songs, it shows the
          diversity of the group at its best.

Song: State Of Grace                    Rating: 1
Comments: Besides it being quick and hard edged, STATE OF GRACE sounds like  
          every other 59 second punk song ever created.

Song: Can't Wait One Minute More        Rating: 5
Comments: Without a doubt the best song on the album. The drums lead the way,
          as the lyrics fit just about perfect to the bouncy rhythm. It  
          coincidentally is their first single.

Song: Trust Slips Through Your Hands    Rating: 4   
Comments: Even if this track just had the intro to it, it would deserve four 
          stars. Not to mention the bombastic kick thrown in by the drums.

Song: Gang Opinion                      Rating: 3
Comments: The lyrics get right to the point and seem to overshadow the music
          which would have been an even better tune if it were longer. 
          
Song: Choices Made                      Rating: 3
Comments: Another anthem for the 90's teens to scream and yell to. "I don't
          need you to make my choices." Teen angst at its best.

Song: Solid Bond                        Rating: 1
Comments: The lyrics seem a bit generic and the rhythm is a little weak, but
          relax, there's seven tracks left to enjoy.

Song: Marching Goals                    Rating: 3
Comments: It's original, you've got to give them that.

Song: United Kids                       Rating: 2
Comments: Nothing new or original can be found on this track, which has angry
          lyrics, but seems like it was just thrown together.

Song: Soundtrack For Violence           Rating: 2
Comments: These guys seem to get more pissed off as the album goes on. It's
          fast, edgy, and it sounds like their others.

Song: Boring Summer                     Rating: 4
Comments: Led by the bass and the crashing cymbals, the louder this is played
          the better the chant of "It's a boring summer" sounds.

Song: Et Tu Brute?                      Rating: 2
Comments: Definitely influenced by QUICKSAND, like the guitars and lyrics.
          It's almost a rip-off.

Song: All Twisted                       Rating: 3
Comments: The only song not written by the band, but you wouldn't know it 
          unless you read the inside of the CD sleeve. The guitars rip the
          whole way through.

Song: Don't Got To Prove It             Rating: 4
Comments: If BAD RELIGION forgot to plug in their instruments and you could
          only hear the repetitive chanting, then it would sound similar to
          this.

Song:                                   Rating: 4
Comments: Hidden track. A great track to end the album with. The dark guitars
          have a fierce rhythm and maybe the best song besides CAN'T WAIT ONE
          MINUTE MORE. Why would they choose this tune to be the 'hidden'
          track?

Artist: Foo Fighters            Album: Foo Fighters

Album Comments: Before listening to FOO FIGHTERS, the bands self-titled, debut
                album, put aside the thoughts that Dave Grohl, the lead singer
                and guitarist, was the drummer from Nirvana. If you think of 
                this group as an extension of Nirvana, then you've already 
                begun to put expectations on them, and limits as well.

Song: This Is A Call                    Rating: 5
Comments: It's not easy having your first track be the first single off of 
          your album, but this works perfectly. With the catchy, almost 
          childlike lyrics and kick ass guitars, this maybe the best song off 
          the album, but it's go competition.
        
Song: I'll Stick Around                 Rating: 5
Comments: Though it may sound like a Nirvana inspired guitar drive, the lyrics 
          put that aside and take control. I personally think that this song 
          adds more to the rest of the album.

Song: Big Me                            Rating: 4
Comments: Its short but sweet. Dave's melodic voice, and light instrumental 
          pace show a slower side of Foo Fighters, a side which is equal to is 
          counterpart.

Song: Alone + Easy Target               Rating: 4
Comments: The fierce guitars added along with the softer voice makes this song
          another favorite of mine.

Song: Good Grief                        Rating: 3
Comments: I feel that if the voice matched the guitars with a more edgy tone,
          then it could have made it a little more interesting.          

Song: Floaty                            Rating: 4   
Comments: With the lyrics and guitars cutting back and forth between 
          psychedelic to hard rock, it shows how the band can use its diversity 
          in the same song.

Song: Weenie Beenie                     Rating: 3
Comments: So what if you can't tell what he's saying, just listen to the  
          rhythms pace and go beat the hell out of a 12 year old.

Song: Oh, George                        Rating: 3
Comments: I guess its tough for them to make a song that doesn't sound like 
          one of their others, but the lyrics do have some meaning to them.
                                                                                     
Song: For All The Cows                  Rating: 5
Comments: How the hell can you not like a song with this title. You can almost 
          guess that when a song starts off this slow paced that it's going to 
          change for the better.

Song: X-Static                          Rating: 2
Comments: Possibly the only weakness of the album. It features a cameo 
          performance by Greg Dulli, guitarist if the Afghan Wigs. The song 
          kind of drags on, but maybe this was part of their plan to lull you 
          asleep for the next track.

Song: Wattershed                        Rating: 5
Comments: As you wake from your lull, you get pounded by the guitars, bass, 
          and drums. Grohl send this song into a moshable state. This will 
          undoubtedly be the next single after I'LL STICK AROUND.

Song: Exhausted                         Rating: 4
Comments: Foo didn't want to end the album on a bad not and they didn't. 
          Though this track isn't the most recognized on the album, it 
          certainly ends it showing how they can calm you down and wake you 
          like and irritating alarm clock.

Artist: Hum                     Album: You'd Prefer An Astronaut

Album Comments: HUM's debut album which is released on the RCA label is that
                of mellow vocals with loud distorted instrumentals. All the
                the tracks on this album show a great deal of energy, yet it
                seems HUM is always holding something back, ready to explode.

Song: Little Dipper                     Rating: 4
Comments: This is a great start off track to show you how HUM is. The mellow
          vocals with the loud distorted instrumentals.

Song: The Pod                           Rating: 4
Comments: Another track in the HUM fashion.

Song: Stars                             Rating: 5
Comments: The first single off of the album and rightly so, since it probably
          the best song on the album or it's tied with I HATE IT TOO.

Song: Suicide Machine                   Rating: 2
Comments: Nothing in this track really stands out. This is the only weak song
          on the album.

Song: The Very Old Man                  Rating: 3
Comments: One of the two slower songs on the album. Nice guitar riff. Shows
          a different side of HUM. Nice way to end side one of the album.

Song: Why I Like The Robins             Rating: 4   
Comments: "This is a song about a bird."

Song: I'd Like Your Hair Long           Rating: 4
Comments: This is as up tempo as HUM gets. I think they finally let it all
          loose on this track. It fits the HUM pattern, though something 
          about this track makes it stand out.

Song: I Hate It Too                     Rating: 5
Comments: This song is definitely my favorite on the album and could be 
          compared to STARS as the best on the album. The lyrics and the 
          instrumentals on this track are definitely worth listening to 
          since they are incredible.

Song: Songs Of Farewell And Departure   Rating: 3
Comments: Seems they wanted to end the album the same way they did side one,
          showing a different side of HUM, with the only other slow song on
          the album.

Artist: The Presidents of the U.S.A. Album: The Presidents of the U.S.A.

Album Comments: This is definitely a group that is hard to classify into one
                music category since they change from practically song to
                to song. The Presidents are definitely a group that revolves
                mainly around the bass guitar. The lyrics on this album and
                very strange and at times make no sense, but hell, it sounds 
                good.

Song: Kitty                             Rating: 2
Comments: This song definitely gets you ready for what's in store for you on
          the rest of the album. Strange lyrics with great tunes.

Song: Feather Pluckin                   Rating: 3
Comments: This song is nothing special. The chorus reminds of something from
          an old heavy metal album.
            
Song: Lump                              Rating: 5
Comments: The first single of the album and the best song on the album. 
          Reminds me of CIV and CAN'T WAIT ONE MINUTE MORE.

Song: Stranger                          Rating: 1
Comments: This is the worst song on the album.  

Song: Boll Weavil                       Rating: 3
Comments: Great bass lines in this song. The lyrics are still weird though.

Comments: Once again, nothing special.

Comments: I hate repeating myself, but again, nothing special.
          
Song: We Are Not Going To Make It       Rating: 4
Comments: This song is fast paced and something different with the chorus of
          "We're not gonna make it / Cause there's a million better bands /
          With a million better songs." The bass lines on this track a great
          too.

Song: Kick Out The Jams                 Rating: 4
Comments: Another fast paced song with more great bass lines. 

Song: Body                              Rating: 4
Comments: This is a great slow song. Sounds along the lines of something
          PAVEMENT would do.                   

Song: Back Porch                        Rating: 2
Comments: Something of a cross between punk and country music.

Artist: Sweet Diesel            Album: The Kids Are Dead

Album Comments: Many unknown bands are unknown because they have no talent or
                they aren't played on the popular radio stations. Well another
                sad case of a good band which doesn't get much airplay is the
                NYC hardcore band Sweet Diesel. The debut album titled THE 
                KIDS ARE DEAD has been overlooked and could possibly be the
                most consistent hardcore album of 1995.

Song: The Empire Strikes Back           Rating: 3
Comments: The group uses crunchy guitar sounds and a lot of feedback to 
          display their energy, and it works well with the fuzzy yet
          comprehensible lyrics.

Song: Supermarket I Don't Know          Rating: 4
Comments: They keep up the blistering pace as the guitars switch from a high
          to low pitch and then back again, all to the beat of rapid drums.
            
Song: Morning Breath                    Rating: 3
Comments: The instruments take a backseat to the raspy words spat out by lead
          singer Nat. The bass is the loudest instrument played on this track,
          which gives it a unique sound.

Song: I Hate The Man                    Rating: 2
Comments: It starts out great but the vocals sounds a little too hardcore for 
          the track which features great rhythm. Don't fool with perfection 
          guys.

Song: I'm Just A Kid In This Town       Rating: 3
Comments: Perhaps the greatest bouncy rhythm ever created. It is helped out by
          the flying drums and raw bass sounds.

Song: You Want It                       Rating: 3
Comments: Almost sounds like they would slow down on this track, but once the
          screeching vocals start in, the feedback is let loose and keeps 
          their consistency alive and well.

Song: Gallon Man                        Rating: 4
Comments: Not since Led Zeppelin has a band made a song that is off tempo in
          some parts and actually make it work. The chant of "liver like a
          sponge" is a classic.
          
Song: The Kids Are Dead                 Rating: 4
Comments: Their first single and coincidentally the same name as the album.
          Though it isn't that lengthy, it is obviously the most thought out
          song with screams that will kick your ass.

Song: Enemy                             Rating: 3
Comments: At the beginning the guitars are at a jerky pace and never really
          get going until the end. It gives it a different sound with another 
          guitar in the background and the vocals in your face.

Song: Workers Comp                      Rating: 3
Comments: Still consistent with the quick fastball tempo, with almost dueling
          instruments and loud painful lyrics.

Song: What Happened To My Anger         Rating: 3
Comments: With lyrics and vocal power to match another NYC hardcore band,
          Unsane, the distorted guitars rip their way through the teen angst
          lyrics and high pitched feedback.

Artist: Tripping Daisy          Album: I'm An Elastic Firecracker

Album Comments: TRIPPING DAISY is another Dallas, Fort Worth, band like the
                TOADIES. They have a major following in Texas and for good
                reason. The album reminds me a lot of PORNO FOR PYRO'S, mainly
                because of Tim's, the lead singers, high pitched vocals and
                the mellow tunes with that slight edge.

Song: Rocketpop                         Rating: 3
Comments: You know what you can expect from TRIPPING DAISY after listening to
          this track. Tim's strange voice fits in with the strange 
          instrumentals. Just when you think the are going to speed up, they 
          slow down, and when you think they are going to slow down, they 
          speed up.

Song: Bang                              Rating: 3
Comments: From its mellow beginnings the words "All you do is try it / You go
          inside the whore and buy it / And if you think you will like it / I
          will be hear to let you stay" lead you into a rocking chorus and
          back again.
            
Song: I Got A Girl                      Rating: 4
Comments: This is the first single off the album and definitely a catchy 
          tune.

Song: Piranha                           Rating: 3
Comments: This is a very laid back track with a great intro.

Song: Motivation                        Rating: 2
Comments: Another slow track that shows the different dimensions of Tim's
          voice.

Song: Same Dress New Day                Rating: 1
Comments: These are some of the strangest instrumentals and lyrics on the
          album. In this track it just doesn't seem to work like they make it
          do in the other songs on the album.

Song: Trip Along                        Rating: 5
Comments: This is a great song. It has a great guitar riff to start the song.
          It starts out slow and has a killer chorus.

Song: Step Behind                       Rating: 3
Comments: Another good track, although nothing really makes it stand out from
          the others and by now you know what to expect.

Song: Noose                             Rating: 3
Comments: Very slow song with a let loose chorus.

Song: Prick                             Rating: 4
Comments: One of the louder songs on the album. Great guitar riffs and Tim's 
          voice fits this song perfectly.

Song: High                              Rating: 2
Comments: This is a really mellow and relaxed track to end the album with.

You, a lot of bands, and the internet: What a better way to communicate?
by John Yatsko        

        You've heard this a million times by now: "Computers affect our every 
day lives." Well it's true, they do, so why not in the music industry too? 
Computers are have already been is use by a number of bands and studios to 
create music. Filter recently released this statement in their debut album 
Short Bus: "There is a certain subset of musicians who for reasons unknown 
adhere to the false premise that "electronic" music or the tools involved 
imply a lack of creativity of inspired performance. Technology in the hands 
of creative, intelligent individuals is a tool for art, not a hindrance. 
Filter, being members of the current millennia, admit freely to the use of 
such devices." In fact, Filter had planned on creating an entire album with a
computer. Not only are bands and studios using computers to create music, 
bands, music labels, and fans are using computers to talk about and promote 
music. Instead of getting out the old pen and paper to contact an artist or 
record label, you can simply send them email. Bands such as Filter and 
Letters To Cleo and labels such as Sony and Reprise can be contacted via 
email over the internet.
        
        On the World Wide Web you will find a number of music magazines and 
even be able to download audio and video clips of your favorite bands. A 
great place to find bands and magazines is the Internet Underground Music 
Archive (IUMA for short). IUMA has a large collection of music from various 
artists, that are either unsigned or on independent labels, that you can 
download for free. The music on IUMA ranges from classical to punk and 
everything in between. If you have a band, you can even send a sound clip of 
your band to IUMA for other people to download. IUMA also has a great 
magazine online called Addicted To Noise (ATN). In recent issues they have 
done interviews with Filter, Sonic Youth, Everclear, and Silverchair. You can 
also download audio and video clips from ATN, all of which is totally free.

        Recently I had a chance to chat with Howie Klein, President of 
Reprise Records, while emailing Filter at ShortBus@aol.com. Howie was reading 
and responding to email sent to Filter, but assured me that, "yes, the band 
members read a lot of the e-mail when they're off the road (which seems rarer 
and rarer these days)." On average Filter receives about a dozen emails per 
day from fans, which is to the benefit of the fans since email is so much 
easier to read and respond to than regular mail. You may even receive a reply 
to your email within the same day, something the U.S. Post Office cannot 
offer. All in all, the internet is a great way to communicate with bands and 
record labels and an inexpensive way to check out some of the newest artists 
around.

Lyrics:

    My friends are so depressed
    I feel the question of your loneliness
    Confide 'cause I'll be on your side
    You know I will you know I will
  
    Ex girlfriend called me up
    Alone and desperate on the prison phone
    They want to give her seven years
    For being sad

  Chorus:
    I love all of you
    Hurt by the cold
    So hard and lonely too
    When you don't know yourself

  My friends are so distressed
  And standing on the brink of emptiness
  No words I know of to express
  This emptiness
  
  chorus

  Imagine me taught by tragedy
  Release is peace
  I heard a little girl
  And what she said
  Was something beautiful
  To give your love
  No matter what she said

The Wild Punk Fest At The Warp Tour
by John Yatsko

        Over 35 bands playing from coast to coast in 24 cities, including some 
in Canada, followed by an onturage of skaters, bikers, and inline skaters. 
"Extreme sports meets extreme music," stated a member of one of the bands 
playing at the Warp Tour. 

        None of these bands, with the exception of CIV, make the daily MTV 
video rotation and none of these sports are our national pastime...yet. With 
punk and hardcore music gaining popularity and the success of bands like Green 
Day and Offspring, more shows like the Warp Tour are bound to come to your 
local area.

        There was a rainbow of hair colors to be seen and numerous tattoos and 
piercings. The music was great and the atmosphere, although thought of on the 
outside as violent and harsh, was friendly. Mosh pits, crowd surfers, and 
stage dives were all in the days fun. Exhibitions put on by bikers, skaters, 
and inline skaters went on all day on both the halfpipe and the street course. 
The theme of the Warp Tour though, was music, music, and more music.

        Quicksand and L7 headlined most of the tour. Other bands such as CIV, 
Orange 9mm, fluf, Sublime, Sick Of It All, Wizo, No Use For A Name, and Tilt 
played at just about every show.  About two dozen or more bands played at 
certain venues that were closer to home for them, along with a bunch of local 
acts. All the bands were great and really enthused to play on a tour like
the Warp Tour. Hopefully next year there will be a follow up tour.

Spotlight...Toadies & Orange 9mm
by John Yatsko

Toadies
-------

        Toadies are a Dallas, Fort Worth, band which released a five song EP 
entitled Pleather on Grass Records last year. The original lineup for the 
band was Todd Lewis, lead vocals, Charles Mooney, guitar, Lisa Umbarger, bass, 
Mark Reznicek, drums, Darrel Herbert, guitar, and Tracey Sauerwien played 
guitar on a few tracks. A year later they released their debut album, 
Rubberneck, on Interscope Records. The lineup had changed from a six person 
band to a four person band. Todd Lewis picked up a guitar and also did lead 
vocals, Lisa Umbarger stayed to play the bass, Mark Reznicek on the drums, and 
Darrel Herbet on guitar along with Todd. The Toadies have 3 singles off of
Rubberneck, Mister Love, Backslider, and Possum Kingdom. It's been well over
six months since the release of the album and the Toadies are finally getting 
the air play they deserve with their third single off their album, Possum
Kingdom. They rank in the top ten on most alternative radio stations around 
the country and are in the daily rotation on MTV. They have been touring with
Bush the past few months, since there original touring partner The Cult didn't 
go on tour. The Toadies weren't too thrilled about going on tour with The Cult 
in the first place.


Orange 9mm
----------

        Orange 9mm is straight from the New York hardcore scene, growing up on
matinee shows at CBGB's. They 9mm formed in 1993 with the original members, 
Chaka Malik, lead vocals, Eric Rice, bassist, Larry Gorman, drummer, and 
Chris Traynor, lead guitarist, were all in their twenties. A year later they 
released a self-titled four track EP on Revelation Records. The EP contains
the songs Driver, Dry, Cutting and Draining, and Can't Decide. Cutting and
Draining and Can't Decide are on their debut album, Driver Not Included, which
was released earlier this year on EastWest Records. The new album also has a
new lineup for the group. They got a new bassist, Davide Gentile, and a new 
drummer, Matthew Cross. Chaka, Chris, Davide, and Matthew just seem to click,
which would be the main reason the band was able to release their second 
album a year after losing half of its members. Orange 9mm is in line with the 
new type of hardcore coming out of New York. They seem to fit in with the
likes of Quicksand and CIV, but definitely have their own unique sound. They
are able to keep their edge with aggressive vocals, yet still be able to throw
in some rhythm and harmony. Orange 9mm toured all across the country this
summer with the Warp Tour. You can easily tell that Orange 9mm loves to play
their music with their enthusiasm on strange as well as in their songs.

Riffs                            
by Brian Jones

        This is my first actual article for the mag (I also did the tab in 
this issue), but hopefully it isn't my last. I decided to do a Guitar column
because i know from experience that learning the guitar can be frustrating
if you don't have the right teacher. I had one guitar teacher that knew a lot
about the guitar, but couldn't read music, so he could only teach me the
basic stuff. I wanted to know more than that, so i found a new teacher. He
was it. I learned so much from him, Just from the first lesson. I was amazed.

        I have been playing guitar for about 2 years now, and through my 
experience, I found that the most important aspect of the guitar is learning 
the notes. If you have any musical background like I did (6 years of piano
lessons) it is a little easier, but still as important. The notes on a guitar,
as well as any instrument, are the same. They range from A-G, and then 
continue that pattern, only octaves higher or lower. An Octave consists of 8 
notes (C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C), and is what every song, chord, or solo is based on. 
As the octaves go higher, the names of the notes stay the same, but when you 
read them on paper, it is located in a different position, so that is how they 
are identified.

     The names(or notes) of a guitar go as follows:

     if you are looking at your guitar from an above angle)

     -------------------e----------------
     -------------------B----------------
     -------------------G----------------
     -------------------D----------------
     -------------------A----------------
     -------------------E----------------

        Those are the notes of the strings as if they were played "OPEN", or
without fretting any of them. Now, I will show you your first Scale, Gmajor.
This scale is one of the easiest scales to learn. The scale can be played
starting from any G on the guitar, but I will show you starting with the
low E.
                       
e:--------------------------------------0--2--3-| 
B:-----------------------------0--1--3----------|          
G:-----------------------0--2-------------------|
D:--------------0--2--4-------------------------|                         
A:-----0--2--3----------------------------------|                                  
E:--3-------------------------------------------|

     The notes of the scale go as follows G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G.
There are 16 notes in that scale. The first 8 are one octave, and the second
8 are the same notes, only an octave higher. If you study the names of the
notes in relation to their positions on the fretboard, it should be pretty
easy to learn the names of the frets. As for next issue, I will show 2 more
scales (Cmajor, and the blues scale), along with some chords.
