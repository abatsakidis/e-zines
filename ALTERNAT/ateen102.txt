        Please excuse the extreme lateness of this issue of the Alternateen
Digest. This month has been sort of a hectic month. During Thanksgiving I
was at home for a long period of time, away from my computer, so I couldn't
get the magazine done. But I do have a good excuse. I was at home checking
out some shows and getting interviews for the magazine. After I got back it
was crunch time since the end of the semester was on its way and finals were
about to begin. You know how teachers all love to pile a bunch of work on
you all at the same time. Well enough excuses. Here's the mag. Enjoy! Happy
Holidays.

        You can now find the Alternateen Digest on the World Wide Web on the
internet. Check out our web page at http://www.voicenet.com/~dagmar. Each
new issue will be put on the web page. There's even pictures and other 
graphics to be seen on the web page that aren't in the text format.

        ATD's biggest problem with meeting our release date, the 15th of every

Album Reviews: Deftones, For Squirrels, Shades Apart, Smile
by Various Staff Members
                           
                           Deftones --- Adrenaline
                            Review by Dan Daidone

     Obviously, influenced by Rage Against The Machine and Pantera, the debut
album from the Deftones is filled with catchy riffs and ear piercing lyrics.
The 11 song album (including hidden song) which was originally titled
"Conceited", but was later changed to "Adrenaline", and rightfully so, lets
the listener know what is in store for them. Expect to hear much more from
this quartet, especially after people hear their first single "7 words" and
say "OH MY GOD! Did you hear that?!" The Deftones obviously know how to stir
things up and will catch on quickly to listeners. If you like loud, hard
music, this is a must.

                         Overall Album rating = 3.7
                                 
Track 1 - Bored                                                 Rating = 4
Chino Moreno's voice leads the raunchy guitar riff, with an even better 
lyrical rhythm which is deceiving and evil at the same time.

Track 2 - Minus Blinfold                                        Rating = 4
Led by the bass and distracting easy guitar in the background, the screams 
lead into a loud and edgy rhythm.

Track 3 - One Weak                                              Rating = 4
Once again led by the dark bass, you just wait to have your head blown off by 
the destructive guitar and equally loud lyrical content.

Track 4 - Nosebleed                                             Rating = 5
There is no need for analyzing this song. Just flip into things and get angry!

Track 5 - Lifter                                                Rating = 4
By now you already know that the song is going to be loud, as like the others, 
the lyrics sift through the sounds.

Track 6 - Root                                                  Rating = 4
The disturbing lyrics math the powerful instruments in a tune which stays away 
from the same old Verse-chorus-Verse.

Track 7 - Words                                                 Rating = 5
Their first single matches the description of their others with the main 
ingredient being POWER. The low key bass hides behind the treble filled guitar 
and the cymbal smashes.

Track 8 - Birthmark                                             Rating = 3
You can predict when the instruments are going to take off and the lyrics take 
on the same pattern as in the preceding songs.
                                
Track 9 - Engine No. 9                                          Rating = 4
They don't seem to have any problems with consistency, nor do they have any 
problems writing catchy grooves.

Track 10 - Fireal                                               Rating = 2
You get used to the catchy guitar rhythms and mysterious lyrics from the other 
tunes and you become spoiled.

Track 11 - Hidden Song                                          Rating = 2
Should have ended the album with the intensity that it started with, although 
this is somewhat of a change.
                                
                          For Squirrels -- Example
                           Review by  John Yatsko

        For Squirrels is made up of Jack Vigliatura doing the vocals, Bill
White on bass, Travis Michael Tooke on guitar, and Jack Griego on drums. 
Tragically on September 8th on the way home to Florida from the famous C.B.G.B.
in New York, singer Jack Vigliatura, bassist Bill White, and tour manager
Tim Bender all died when their van got a blow out and flipped over on 
Interstate 95. I consider myself one of the fortunate few to get to see the
For Squirrels just as they were signed to Sony 550 Music at the Trocadero in
Philadelphia, where they played with Hum and The Verve. The album they have
left behind, Example, is great. Jack sings in 8:02 PM, "I just want my day to
come." Well, that it did. In the same song he sings, "Gone but not forgotten."
With the album they have left behind, they will be anything but forgotten.

                         Overall Album rating = 3.3
                                 
Track 1 - 8:02 PM                                               Rating = 3
One of the harder songs on the album. Great guitar riff.

Track 2 - Orangeworker                                          Rating = 3
With this track they slow it down and throw in a piano as an extra element.
It has a chorus that just makes you want to sing along.

Track 3 - Superstar                                             Rating = 4
Once again it gets louder and faster with the primal scream of 'superstar'
for the chorus.

Track 4 - Mighty K.C.                                           Rating = 5
Jack seems to put a great deal of emotion into the 'down-and-out' verses and  
the 'happy-go-lucky' chorus. This song is also the first single on the album.

Track 5 - Under Smithville                                      Rating = 5
This album is chalk full of great songs, and this is another one of them.

Track 6 - Long Live The King                                    Rating = 3
The Squirrels finally let it all loose on this track.

Track 7 - The Immortal Dog And Pony Show                        Rating = 2
This may be the only song where the Squirrels slip a notch. The vocals aren't
great, but the instrumentals are. The piano is thrown in once again for  
something out of the ordinary.

Track 8 - Stark Pretty                                          Rating = 3
Speed it up once again. The instrumentals in this tune are great and match the 
vocals perfectly.
                                
Track 9 - Disenchated                                           Rating = 3
Another great song that John puts a lot of soul into. His voice was made for
this song.

Track 10 - Eskimo Sandune                                       Rating = 2
It sounds like a cheesy love song from an Elvis beach movie. The song does 
stand out from the others, but I don't know if that's a good or bad. The
instrumentals get a little strange on this track where they even bring in a
synthesizer.

                           Shades Apart -- Save It
                            Review by Dan Daidone

        This three-man New Jersey band proves that consistency is king, on
their first full length album released on Revelation Records. Though all of
the songs display power, they'll become most well known for their cover of
"Tainted Love", which can already be seen on MTV. They have a lot of potential 
but lack depth, which is their only flaw. Otherwise, they display the rawness 
of rock n' roll, which many bands don't have or which many bands had but lost 
it along the way.

                        Overall Album Rating - 3.3

Track 1 - Menace                                                Rating = 4
The album starts off with a bang. Led by the guitar which could stand alone.

Track 2 - Gun                                                   Rating = 3
The guitar feedback actually makes the rhythm for the this tune which kind of 
helps the shallow lyrics get by.

Track 3 - Weight of Years                                       Rating = 3
The lyrics are much stronger in this tune which could have been better if it 
were matched instrumentally.

Track 4 - Monster                                               Rating = 4
The rhythm seems to jump back and forth and equally matches the power of the 
lyrics which are weighted by their originality.

Track 5 - Secret Life                                           Rating = 3
The lyrics are once again backed up by the high-pitched guitar sound and 
speedy drums.

Track 6 - Way Out                                               Rating = 3
It sounds just as good, if not the same as their others, but continues the 
consistency of the album.

Track 7 - Nothing's Real                                        Rating = 3                
The lyric rhythm becomes predictable but doesn't take away from the song, 
except for it's originality.

Track 8 - Valid                                                 Rating = 4
You don't get any different than this. An instrumental is highly necessary for 
this album and is done to perfection.

Track 9 - September Burns                                       Rating = 2
The lyrics are decent, but it just doesn't seem to hold the rest of the song 
together.

Track 10 - Brutus                                               Rating = 3
Consistency continues. If you like the first seven songs, then add this to 
your list.

Track 11 - Tainted Love                                         Rating = 5
There is nothing better than to hear a crappy 80's song, reconstructed into an 
awesome cover song. Ed Cobb wishes he would have done it this way when he played 
it.

Hidden Track                                                    Rating = 3
Not really hidden, just not on the album sleeve. It's reminiscent of Bad 
Religion, which is a good compliment.

Hidden Track                                                    Rating = 3
Also sounds like Bad Religion and ends the album on a respectable note.
                                 
                               Smile -- Maquee
                            Review by Dan Daidone

        At the time of this writing, the band Smile is virtually unknown to
most people, but don't expect that to last much longer. The review of this
album is kind of late, considering the band recorded it on March of 1994 and
have a new album on the way. Putting that aside, the songs are catchy even
at first listen and the three piece band shows their talents instrumentally
(which is something many bands cannot do). The entire album is respectable.
Otherwise, this band will be around to see the next decade and will 
undoubtedly attract more listeners for the future.

                           Overall Album rating = 3.8   

Track 1 - Rock Anthem for the Teenage Hipster Population        Rating = 4
It starts out with a ripping guitar and everything seems to fit into place 
from the beginning to the end. The title alone makes the song.

Track 2 - Staring at the Sun                                    Rating = 4
Between the bass drum and the bass guitar, it's tough to tell which one is 
louder. Nonetheless, this is their first single, and deservingly so.

Track 3 - Spud Gun                                              Rating = 4
The cartoonish bass and real-life lyrics carry this song through the meshing 
bass drum once again.

Track 4 - Picture Made Past                                     Rating = 2
The only weak spot on the album. Though it's different with a slower pace, it 
never really catches on.

Track 5 - Lemonade                                              Rating = 4
They redeem themselves from the last song with rage filled lyrics and a killer 
guitar line which compliments the chant "Sunshine Goodbye!"

Track 6 - Moosh                                                 Rating = 3
The drums take control over this song, drowning out the almost Gin Blossoms 
sounding lyrics. The guitar and the bass make up for that.

Track 7 - Jack Shrimp                                           Rating = 5
The story telling lyrics blend perfectly with the flying drums and the bass 
driven rhythm.

Track 8 - Papaya Clearance Sale                                 Rating = 4
The dark lyrics hit home with the hidden guitar that lets loose a destructive 
pulse-pounding beat.

Track 9 - She                                                   Rating = 5
The best song on the album displays the bands instrumental talents, in a 
classic style. The lyrics add an edge to a song which doesn't even need it. 
The song just rules.

Track 10 - Wallflower                                           Rating = 3
The song has many different topics, all mixed together, but it works well with 
this short but sweet tune.

Track 11 - Until(?)                                             Rating = 4
The album ends with a little slower pace but the lyrics take over and add 
another dimension to the song.

Sparkling, But Not Fading: Everclear
by John Yatsko

        "It ain't an autograph if you can read it." -- Art Alexakis

        This month I was planning on using Everclear as one of our Spotlight 
bands. Then I heard that they were coming to Philadelphia so I decided to hold 
off on the Spotlight and just do a show review. Well the news just kept 
getting better. I was told by Brian that we were going to get a press pass and 
a photo pass for the show. So we were thinking that we may be able to do an 
interview. Well after the show Everclear took the time to sit down with us to 
answer some questions. So instead of having a Spotlight, show review, and 
interview, I figured I would roll it all up into one feature article.

The band:
        
        Everclear consists of Art Alexakis on guitar and vocals, Craig Montoya 
on bass, and Greg Eklund on the drums. Everclear is definitely sparkling with 
the painstaking, but well deserved, success of their second album, Sparkle and 
Fade released this year on Capitol Records.

        A friend of mine, Dan Daidone and a writer for ATD, turned me on to 
Everclear a few months ago. I got a copy of the Sparkle and Fade album and 
haven't stopped listening to it since. Every time you listen to it you find 
out something new about both the band and yourself. It's truly a great album. 
One of which, I feel, is the best released this year.

        Everclear has been called many things, even some say they sound like 
Nirvana. One label they usually take on is punk. Sure the angst is there, but 
I like to think of Everclear's music as more complex than power chords and 
loud screams, because it is. Maybe it does fit the punk persona though, since 
punk has been becoming more melodic and harmonic over the years. Art simply 
classifies his music as "Rock n' roll, man."

        In 1993 Everclear released their first album, World of Noise, on the 
indie label Tim Kerr Records. A year of playing numerous clubs and talking to 
Gary Gersh, president of Capitol Records and the man that signed Sonic Youth, 
lead to a record deal and the release of Sparkle and Fade earlier this year.

The show:

        Finally, a chance to see Everclear on November 28th at J.C. Dobbs, 
located on South Street, in Philadelphia. This was the third time the band had 
been in Philadelphia since August on what seemed to be a neverending tour with 
the likes of Filter and Sponge, to name a few, as well as headlining many of 
their own shows. So I had broke the news to my parents that I would be missing 
two days of school to get my chance to see Everclear and possibly get an 
interview with the band.

        We headed down to the show early on a cold Tuesday night. We were 
there very early, one of the first ten in line for the show. We figured we'd 
go early so we could find out for sure if we were on the guest list to get our 
press passes, since we couldn't verify it earlier that day by telephone. While 
waiting in line we caught a glimpse of Art, Greg, and Craig entering the club, 
giving their 'How you doing's?' in passing.

        The show seemed to be getting off to a late start. Finally, a van 
pulled up with a trailer attached that had some things to be unloaded. 'Ruth 
Ruth' was stenciled on the amps and boxes as they were unloaded by the roadie 
and various band members. Ruth Ruth was the opening for Everclear that night. 
Art came out of the club to help the roadie and the band members bring the 
equipment inside. It looked as if Art wanted to get the show on the road, so 
to speak, and was anxious to play.

        Finally, the doors opened and we found out that we were getting in 
with press passes. That meant that we didn't have to pay the six dollars, 
which I was more than willing to pay to see a band like Everclear, what a 
bargain, to get in.

        We asked at the door if it would be possible to get an interview with 
Everclear and we were directed to talk to Shawn, Everclear's road manager. So 
after making our way inside we found Shawn and he granted us the interview, 
we just had to wait until after the show.

        Ruth Ruth opened. They ran through songs on their Laughing Gallery 
album, including: Uninvited, I killed Meg The Prom Queen, and Uptight. Art 
could be found in the crowd on the side of the stage taking in the show.

        Art and the rest of Everclear finally took the stage. They played 
songs from both of their albums. You can really feel the intensity of the 
songs when you see them live. Art puts everything into the show, seemingly 
saying 'this is all that matters to me at this point in time'. Art has a great 
stage presence. Sometimes the small stage didn't seem big enough for both 
Craig and Art, as Art would occasionally, but purposely, run into Craig. Art 
informed the crowd that they would knock off a little early if anyone would 
like to come up for autographs or talk to the band after the show. Everclear 
finished their show to the dismay of the crowd. One spectator yelled, we got 
all night and Art replied, yeah, all fucking night. The band had some time 
left so they did an encore. The songs included an AC/DC song with lead vocals
by Craig, another cover tune with lead vocals by their road manager Shawn, 
and Sexual Life, a song they don't normally play live, off of their Sparkle 
and Fade album.

        The show was truly great and definitely worth the wait. If Everclear 
comes to your town, don't miss your chance to see them.

The interview:

        Just a few people made their way out directly after the show. 
Everclear was true to their words, talking with people and signing autographs 
after the show.

        We waited for about thirty minutes until the place was cleared out. 
Shawn introduced us to Everclear, we had a seat, and got down to business.

ATD:    So, do you guys like playing in Philadelphia?
Art:    Yeah, it's fun. It's always a good show. It was a good sold-out show 
        tonight. Small place, but we have a good following here. It's building 
        every time we come back.
Greg:   Yeah, love South Street too.
ATD:    Think about playing anywhere else? Like the Trocadero or anything a 
        little bigger?
Art:    Yeah when we're bigger I think. Yeah, I think next time we come here 
        we'll have sold enough records that we justify playing a bigger place.
        I think it was too packed tonight, anyhow, it was just too small. They
        started turning people away at the door probably about a half hour 
        before we started playing.
Greg:   Yeah, it keeps getting bigger and bigger, you know. Moving and moving. 
        Taking steps forward.
ATD:    What are some of your influences?
Art:    Music wise, my influences range from everything. From old-time country 
        music, old-time blues, to heavily I'd say like, Sonic Youth, Neil 
        Young, Pixies, Hank Williams Sr., not junior, I hate junior. Uhm, 
        Kiss, the whole thing. Rock n' roll stuff.
ATD:    What do you guys listen to know?
Art:    Been listening a lot to the Ruth Ruth album, actually, yeah.
Greg:   Ruth Ruth.
Art:    Ruth Ruth, and band called Hag Fish. I been listening a lot to, I'm 
        really discovering jazz for the first time, like old jazz. 50's and 
        60's I really like that. Miles Davis, all that stuff.
ATD:    When you write songs do you usually come up with the music first or
        the lyrics? 
Art:    Sometimes I come up with lyrics, usually the music first. I write the 
        songs and I'll come up with like a skeleton of a song, basically. 
        Flushed out pretty much with melodies. I might not even have the words 
        yet, but I'll have like one line that repeats. But I'll have the 
        melody, I'll have the song done, then we'll work out the music and the 
        melody and then I'll write the lyrics. I'll know what the songs about 
        lyrically, I just won't have the lyrics flushed out. I'll just let the 
        idea set in my head, then it'll come out. I produce the band in the 
        studio too.
ATD:    Doing anything else with any other bands? Producing them?
Art:    Yeah I have a long list of bands. There's a band called Frog Pond on 
        Sony Records, on Relativity a subsidiary of Sony, and we're looking 
        forward to working together. Hopefully that can work out. I'm talking 
        to a lot of big bands, but I can't really mention it or I'll get in 
        trouble.
ATD:    Are you looking to play with anybody now? You mentioned you like Ruth 
        Ruth. Is there any other bands out there that you like and would like 
        to play with?
Art:    A friend of ours turned us on to Ruth Ruth. Yeah, we're always looking 
        for cool bands.
ATD:    Anybody that you would like to play with now?
Art:    We're hoping to get a couple of big tours, again I can't mention it 
        because it might jinx it.
Greg:   But you'll know. The time will come and you'll know.
Art:    We've turned down a lot of big tours. We like headlining and we will 
        open for the right bands, but I don't wanna open for the wrong bands. 
        No matter how many people we're playing in front of.
ATD:    A good audience that's there to see you, not them?
Art:    Well, or that's there to see them, but will get it. As long as they 
        get it. I like to play to people who don't have the records.
ATD:    You (Craig) gonna be singing any songs anytime soon?
Craig:  I sure hope so. I'm just learning, ya know. I'm learning how to play 
        and sing.
Art:    Doing a fine job. The next album we'll probably have him singing lead 
        on at least one song. I'm gonna push him to it.
ATD:    You working on a new album now?
Art:    In my head. I'm writing songs. I've got like what, about twelve songs 
        written. Got about three or four more. 
ATD:    Where are you heading to next?
Art:    Upstate New York, and then Connecticut, and then New York city, on 
        Friday, we're playing with the Foo Fighters And Girls Against Boys, a 
        show we're really excited about. Then we fly to Seattle and we start 
        playing these Christmas, radio, Christmas shows and were flying all 
        over the country back and forth for about three weeks. We're playing 
        with Porno For Pyros.
Greg:   Sonic Youth. Tripping Daisy.
Art:    Sonic Youth, and The Rentals, and Tripping Daisy we're playing with
Craig:  Oasis.
Art:    Oasis we're playing with. Jawbreaker. Yeah, it's gonna be a great show 
        in Seattle. We're gonna be dead man. Fifth show in a row. I'm sure 
        we're gonna be up really late Saturday, we probably won't even go to 
        bed. Friday night. Hanging out with the Foo Fighters. Oh, it's old. It 
        gets old.
ATD:    Did you have a different drummer before for the first album?
Art:    Yeah we had a different drummer who started with the band. This guy 
        named Scott who just never really clicked. Personality wise me and 
        Craig clicked right from the beginning. He had drug problems and 
        personality problems. Just really never felt like a band. Felt like me 
        and Craig against the whole world. Like we were dragging this guy 
        behind. Like we were running shy a couple cylinders. And then we made 
        the decision before we were going to a major label that we were gonna 
        get a new drummer. He (Greg) called us. He heard about us. He was a 
        fan and basically said 'I'm your drummer'.
ATD:    So you were looking for one at the time when you picked him up?
Art:    Yeah we were already auditioning people.
Craig:  We told one or two people that we were looking for a drummer and it 
        just leaked out to Greg. Nobody would give him Art's phone number. 
        Finally, he got it and came over and jammed. We knew from like the 
        first song he played with us that he was gonna be the drummer.
ATD:    So how did you guys (Art and Craig) met?
Art:    I had an add in a local paper called The Rocket, which is out of 
        Seattle. He liked some of the influences and he had just gotten, he 
        had just moved from Washington, and his band had just broken up the 
        day before. He called me the next day. Fucking talked his ear off on 
        the phone and I was just really focused and he had never met anyone 
        like that before. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I had a bunch of 
        songs, most of them that made it to World of Noise and we got going. 
        Clicked.
ATD:    It's really cool that you guys get to talk to the fans.
Art:    We do it at just about every show, but every time we play hear they 
        just kick people out right away. So we made certain that that wasn't 
        gonna happen tonight and that was really cool.
ATD:    Do you like to get that feedback and those letters and stuff?
Art:    Yeah I love it. I mean it shows that people really care about the 
        band. There's a big underground movement with this band and it's not 
        hype.  I mean our label doesn't spend a whole lot of money promoting 
        us. They're starting to now cause sales are starting to take off and 
        we're getting a lot of MTV and a lot of press and it's just really 
        organically, like climbing. It's just from us constantly touring, 
        reading our own fan mail, and returning it. People dig that. There's 
        all these things on the internet. None of us are on the internet.
ATD:    Addicted To Noise. Band of the year.
Art:    Yeah that's pretty cool. There's all these like, web sites, that we 
        have nothing to do with. They start up on their own. There's three web 
        sites that are Everclear web sites. I've heard of two. There's one 
        called Nehelem and one called Summerland. And there's like two talking 
        blocks too. Like just people, girls going 'oh, I think Greg's so 
        cute'. 
ATD:    So the tours wrapping up around Christmas time?
Art:    Right before Christmas, yeah. Well the tour ends on Friday and then we 
        start flying around and doing these radio shows. These Christmas 
        shows. And we've got, I think what, ten of them, over a period of two 
        and a half weeks.
ATD:    So you gonna take a break then after that?
Greg:   YEAH!
Art:    Yeah. Bout a month and a week.
ATD:    Work on....?
Art:    No, we ain't working on shit. I don't have the time. We're going back 
        out on tour. We'll try and get together to write songs. I just want 
        to spend time with my daughter.
ATD:    How would you classify yourselves? 
Art:    Rock 'n roll. I don't like labels. It doesn't mean anything. It's all 
        rock 'n roll. If it's guitar, bass, and drums it's rock 'n roll. 
        Pretty much.
ATD:    How'd you guys like doing that video (Santa Monica)?
Art:    It's alright. Videos suck. I hate doing videos.
ATD:    Who's the chick in the video?
Art:    Did you see the movie Species?
Greg:   Yeah, well, it's not her.
Art:    Well that's not her. No, she's in the movie. She gets killed by the 
        lead chick. She's sitting on the toilet and gets her spine ripped off.
Craig:  That's a good part. 

        With that the interview ended. I would like to thank Brian Jones 
because he could have done this interview himself, Noel Ramos for getting in 
touch with Everclear for us, and Art, Greg, Craig, and Shawn for taking time 
out of their hectic schedule to sit down with me and do this interview.

What's New?!? 
by John Yatsko
        
No More Quicksand       

        It is well known by now that Quicksand have broken up while on tour 
with CIV, but nobody seems to know why. It was rumored that Walter Schriefels 
would be joining CIV since he wrote all the music and lyrics for their first 
album "Set Your Goals", but this doesn't seem to be the case since everyone 
that has seen CIV recently said that he was not playing with them. I learned 
from someone on the Internet Relay Chat who knows people who know Quicksand, 
that Schriefels has started a new band with Artie Shepard (ex-guitarist of 
Mind Over Matter). There are no specifics on what this band will sound like.

Polygram's Newest Releases        

        November has been a big release month for Polygram and its many 
subsidiary labels. Here's a list of a few albums released this November.

Melissa Etheridge: Your Little Secret

        Etheridge's talents have indeed been no secret since her 1988 debut 
album hit the platinum mark: it's follow-up Brave and Crazy likewise went 
platinum, and 1992's Never Enough bore "Ain't It Heavy," the track which 
earned the singer a Grammy for Best Female Rock Performance. Still, it was 
album number four - 1993's Yes I Am that cemented both Etheridge's celebrity 
and her status as one of America's premier performers. Again produced by Hugh 
Padgham, who played a vital role in making her last album, Your Little Secret 
features the same musicians who have backed Etheridge onstage since the 
release of Yes I Am. Accompanying the singer and her trademark guitar are 
guitarist John Shanks, bassist mark Browne and drummer Dave Beyer, with 
drummer extraordinaire Kenny Aronoff guesting on four of the album's 10 new 
tracks. Never guilty of repeating herself, Etheridge explores new sonic 
territory throughout Your Little Secret - as on "I Could Have Been You," for 
instance, a track co-written with guitarist Shanks that along with its 
powerful lyrical message features unique guitar tuning. Similarly, Etheridge 
wrote the album closer "This Was Is Over" on piano, rather than her usual 
guitar, and surprised herself with the powerful result.

LL Cool J: Mr. Smith

        In a genre where artists have traditionally enjoyed a very short time 
in the limelight, rapper LL Cool J is a record breaker. He was the first Def 
Jam Records artist to release a single, the first to release an album, the 
first rap artist to hit #1 on Billboard's Black Singles chart, the first rap 
artist to amass five consecutive platinum-plus selling albums, four gold 
singles, and over 13 million worldwide album sales, and the first rap artist 
to go acoustic on "MTV Unplugged." He is without a doubt one of the most 
important rap artists ever to grace the genre. With the release of his sixth 
album, Mr. Smith, LL Cool J reaffirms his position as rap's preeminent 
superstar. With a hit NBC television series, In The House, LL has also proven 
that he is something of a renaissance man. But he is careful no to let his 
other interests take away from his priority: Hip Hop. On Mr. Smith, LL Cool J 
proves that he is on top of his game. The album's first single, Hey Lover, was 
a top five smash featuring Boyz II Men. 

Onyx: All We Got Iz Us

        All We Got Iz Us the eagerly awaited follow-up to Onyx's 
ultra-high-energy platinum debut album, Bacdafucup. Featuring "Throw Ya Gunz" 
and the thrash-rap anthem "Slam," Bacdafucup escalated Onyx to the heights of 
international body-slamming mania and became one of the most talked about, 
most popular albums of 1992. Now, they're back and they're grimier than ever. 
Produced by members of the group themselves, All We Got Iz Us represents a
considerable artistic leap forward for Onyx. What hasn't changed is their 
commitment to telling the tales of their hood and their vertiginous pinballing 
between moods of black despair and raucous joy.

Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1

        Bono, Adam Clayton, Brian Eno, Larry Mullen Jr., and The Edge have 
formed a loose collective known as Passengers. On their first album they are 
joined by Mo'Wax maestro Howie B, Japanese singer Holi and opera legend 
Pavarotti. Original Soundtracks 1 was recorded during a two week session in 
London's Westside studio last November and a further five weeks in Dublin this 
summer. The album contains 14 tracks from various movies created all over the 
world. 

Erick Sermon: Double Or Nothing

        With Double Or Nothing, his second solo album on Def Jam Records, 
Erick demonstrates the skills that have earned his props over the years. Erick 
first came on the scene in 1988 as one half of the legendary EPMD. When EPMD 
parted ways in 1992, it was business as usual for Erick, who simply went solo. 
He released an eventually gold solo album No Pressure. With Double Or Nothing, 
Erick is raising the stakes and daring to go "where no other nigga has gone 
before" in hip hop. Bomdigi is the first single off the album and bound to get 
a lot of airplay on hip hop stations. The album is short and sweet, leaving 
listeners wanting more.

Untitled by John Yatsko

no sleep
no peace
no time to retreat
no space of my own
no place to call home
no one is there
no one cares
left alone
out on my own
no way to survive
no way to die
                               
Untitled by Jennifer Beckwith

As the last drop of blood is drained from her throat,
I sit back on my haunches to revel and gloat.
I savor the sweet taste of her essence of life
And sip from my own with the flick of a knife.
Red mortal blood flows through me like wine
As each night I hunt for who I shall dine.
My darkness is broken by the light of the moon
As I sit here reminded that dawn will come soon.
My mind is tortured by an inferno of sin
Knowing that life over death will eternally win.
At the moment of death, I am full of desire,
But after the deed, I'm lost in hell's fire.
My damned soul is centuries ancient and old
And a touch to my skin is sure to be cold.
With a twist of my hand, I shatter the glass
And in a blink of my eye mortal life doth pass.
The creatures of night ceaselessly roam
With the night's black cloak forever their home.
I was once mortal with high hopes and dreams,
But evil turned me and silenced my screams.
Now night after night I'm surrounded by death
As I watch my victims draw their last breath.
I will never find peace, never find light,
Forever bound and chained to live with the night.
