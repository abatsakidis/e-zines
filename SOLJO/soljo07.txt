                 2000: The Evil Emperor of the Net has proclaimed death

                 to anyone distributing the sacred MP3 "Jade" without his

                 express permission. Many of the lands greatest hero's

                 flocked to challenge this unfair and greedy judgement;

                 all were destroyed by the Emperors Champions (The

                 Supreme Court).



                 Now, without the MP3 "Jade" to give happiness, the peasents

                 have become unruly, bands of villans and robbers stalk

                 the land, hacking and random piracy are common place; 

                 anarchy has come. But, in all this chaos, there still may 

                 be, one...


                 Last Hero on DALnet.




[Que bad "Chinnese Style" "Ting, ta-ta-ting-ting-ting-tong-ting" Music. Some kind of, possibly anacronistic train station. JerichoZZ stands, with bad hair (Jet Lee Style) and a bunch of flowers. Everything is spoken in Japanese, and subtitled in Welsh and English. The Music ends.]

Jericho: It has been a quiet day today.

[On Que, a man is randomly thrown through an improbably "light wight" and thin wall of bamboo shoots. He is followed by NURGLE, COMRADE and JADEFALCON.]

Nurgle: Now you take back what you said about my monkey!
Comrade: Yeah!
Jade: er... Yeah!

[Jericho raises an eyebrow and the unruly actions of the three "Robbers." He moves into a "haha" stance, common in alot of Kung-Fu movies. Or so Im told. ]

Nurlge: What you looking at?
Jericho: You have made your point. Now leave.
Comrade: Or what?
Jade: Er... yeah... what they said.

[Note that the dialogue is not at all consistant with the actions of those involved. Nurlge runs at Jericho and lightening fast blows are exchanged; all blocked by Jericho's 'leet "AOL" Skillz. Nurlge steps back and does that "wooooooaaaaaaahaowwwwwwaa" thing which involves spinning around your hands alot.]
	
Nurgle: Now you DIE!
Comrade: Er...
Jade: Thats a bit harsh man, wheres HMV?

[BADGER walks in and looks at the scene... Glancing to JADEFALCON. He points to a large 18th century Japanesse building.]

Badger: Its over there. Hey... Is this Two Armed Boxer One?
Jericho: *Shakes his head* Nope. Its One Armed Boxer Two.
Nurlge: *Ceases his fighting stance* I thought it was Two Boxers Armed with One?
Jade: One what?
Comrade: Arm?

[There is an embarissed Silence. PARIS enters from off stage left. BADGER fades in a cloud of Puff. *Why not?*]

Paris: See. This is what happens when you have a movie parody thats really obscure. And One that Im not in as a main part. This is cleary "Last Hero in China". And just to annoy and confuse you all further... I call into effect "KRULL". So fuck you all.

[Everyone makes "Not that" noises]

Paris: Yes, that.

[Mark Fowler (From Grange Hill, Krull, and then Easterenders; in that order) leaps onto scene from nowhere. Smiles. Nods. Then leaps off.]

Nurgle: *Watches Fowler go, shakes his head and looks back to Jericho before resuming his fighting stance* Lets GO! *Draws a long sword and does some impressive shit with it*
Comrade: Er yeah... *Takes a knife and flings it around abit, loosing his grip it flys off into the distance, un-beknown to him some way off; it hits LLAMA and knocks him out. Lifes a bitch.]
Jade: *Waves his hands about in an unconvincing manner*

Jericho: *Flys into the three with the aid of strings, an impressive kung-fu fight begins, with all the general "Spinning", "Kicking" and "ahahahaha-ing" that that usually intails.*

[PARIS watches the fight with his arms folded, unbeknown to everyone else he calls into effect the Mortal Kombat Card.]

Nurgle: Dont do that, that film was crap!
Paris: I didnt say I was going to do it yet.
Comrade: But you did.

[The fight scene has come to an end. COMRADE, JADE and NURGLE are but a foot away from JERICHO, all standing in semi-sighting pose.]

Paris: So I did... *He Jonny Cage Shadow Kicks JADE throgh a wall; Jade hardly notices, mumbling something about how kinky his Girlfriend is.*

Nurgle: I call into effect THE MASK OF ZORRO!
Comrade: Yeah... no.... actually...
Nurgle: Shut up *Slaps Comrade un-concious*
Jeriocho: That was harsh.
Nurlge: *Shrugs*

[PARIS who had slipped off while no one was looking, returns on a big black horse; he is followed by a number of "Mexican Bandits" and the bloke who fired the guns up in the air outside Bully's (His fist Cameo Appearence)]

Paris: Latin Thug! *Shoots Nurlge*
Jericho: I've had enough of this...

[The bandits crush the train station place and its revealed that we are in a dessert, with HMV in the distance. The bandits circle JerichoZZ.]

Jericho: Right, Paris called in Krull and Mortal Kombat, Nurlgle Called in the Mask of Zorro, I call in....... THE MUMMY! You lucky you all my boys. *He whistles loudly*.

[In the distance, 100 or so Afagaistani Riders appear, lofting their AK47's in a worry manner and crying the now traditional "lalalalalalalalallaallala!" Arab Battle Cry. The bandits turn, kiss their teeth and do that thumb thing. Jericho joins in the "lalalalalallala-ing".]

Paris: Bloody Hell... er... Wasnt this supposed to be a cynical reference to the out lawing of Napster? Instead its decended into a Rankin-like-riot scene... *Frowns*
Jericho: Shit... if this is a Rankin like scene....
Paris: What...?

[ But it was too late, and the Emperor had already sanctioned the use of Carpet bombing.]

<PaRiS> Editorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ez now... Been an eventful few SOL weeks for everyone I think; but it looks as though in terms of setting things up, re designing concepts etc, we have climbed the hill and are now looking at a long and dangerously steep slope on the other side. Nice.

As many of you will already know KlaiRe "Destroyer of Technology" totaled my laptop (and is trying to have a conversation with me on the phone while I type this...) with a glass of orange juice so, in a nut shell, Fallen Angels Publishing Music production have been put on the back burner for now; untill we can retrieve them from the fucking laptop stupid connection HD. Fuck Tosh, a plague on all their houses. etc. Also note that the WOD RPG IRC server has also been placed on the back burner untill we have everything else under control (All this website/promotion shit takes some effort and we are ALL lazy; and most of us now in full time employment, its all very easy to run SOL when your a student, but quite something else when you are working 9/5).

Anyway... We have finally got a Weekend "BBS" Network running, and since we have a server running 24/7 anyway (www.sanction.org/sol) some ppl have asked whats the point. And we are still thinking of one, however, I think at weekends its nice to have a more "Private Server" up with msg's, announcements etc, just as a SOL community thing; so it shall stay on line at weekends (if not just for the channel BOT Majestical - which I know is going down quite well) and hopefully we shall reason out a purpose for it eventually. Or not.

And yes ppl, Admin had "Big Changes" in mind for the 7th month of 2000, so this upheaval was needed; as was the mothballing of the luckstruck site which in our opinion had out lived its time. Last saterdays shoutcast went okay as well... Although a few more SOL visitors wouldnt have been a bad thing.

Last thing to say is: Big shouts to Sanction, and thanks for the space boys. Nuff said, check the network, send us submissions, and prepare thyself.

<PaRiS> Finding a New Medium for the Underground - Where has the Internet gone wrong?  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the creators of the internet get together these days they have
upon their faces and souls an expression of loss, and one of resentment.
Much like any hack/phreak meeting Ive been to in recent years; and you
know why, the two sets of ppl are one in the same. The expression of
both sums up feeling toward the internet and the sad fate it has
suffered at the hands of corporate commercialism; drowned in its prime.


These visionarys of their generation's, of whom very few have actually
made the millions that e-commerce "pioneers"  (or "Internet Rapists")
such as Bill Gates has, now look at their creation in almost contempt. A
recent interview on Radio 4 saw three of them *almost* say this.

And where did it all go wrong?

When analising this we must first go back to the early days; and what
the internet was actually created for. The origins of the internet lie
in two places (arguably more but in essense, two). The American Military
ARPA net, and a British experiment into Networking. Both occuring in the
60's. Without going into great detail:

ARPAnet was intended to provide scientific transfer of data from
computers, for primary use by the military, but also for civillian
benefit. The project was funded by the military BUT carried out by
various university staff all over the USA. The ARPAnet and the internet,
contrary to popular belief had nothing to do with creating a
communications network that could withstand a nuclear assault
(officially anyway...) and anthough this was one of the noted benefits
of the network system we now know as the Internet, it was not a primary
objective.

The British project was more subtle, and involved only one building and
was funded by the British government and in essense the British
Intelligence Service's (Although I doubt that's official).

Basically: The ARPAnet provided the idea,the British project provided
the means, the British reseachers coming up with the now generic
"packet" transfers we are all so familiar with. (all be it on archaic
equipment and at comparitively laughable speeds).

My conclusion of the initial concept behind the internet?

It had absolutely NOTHING to do with the aquisition of money, or the
advitisment of products by ANYONE. The internet was created as a
communications tool; to allow the transfer of data quickly, easily, and
more importantly; without media censorship (this was even one of the
American Military goals concerning the ARPAnet... The idea at the time
being that they could use the internet as a weapon against communism:
which it eventually did, but not in the way they had intended at all).

My point?

Look at the internet today; you cannot jump one HTML transfer without
meeting an advert for a commercial product. You cannot get on the net
without paying a commercial company. You cannot broadcast what you want
to without the permission of a commercial company (your ISP or you web
space provider). You cannot even LOOK at certain sites because they are
deemed to damage other COMMERCIAL/ETHICAL (which is more often than not
a prefix for political) interests.

This surely goes against the very principles that the internet was
created to serve? And the only ppl who go about using the net in the way
that it was intended to be used? The Underground. The Hackers, the
phreaks, the criminals, the ppl who the commercial companys want so
badly to purge; and have done a great job of destroying the communitys
of (and I have no doubt that the stratagy although subtle, is quite
diliberate).

How?

No, they have not stepped up a campaign of Anti-Piracy arrests, and
although most governments legislation has tightend concerning computer
crime; clean up rates have not changed anywhere outside the USA (it
should be added: home of commercialism and indeed Capitalism).

This is not how they have currupted the underground. The internet in
the early 21st century has become accessable to the "Man on the Street".
In essence, and principle, a good thing. In practise however; it can
mean only one thing. You know it, I know it. We all know it.

That "we" being everyone who KNOWS about the origin of the underground;
who sat at our 16 BIT/8 BIT machines checking out pirate games and
softwaer; logging on the painfully slow BB's because the only way we
could afford to run a computer was by pirating software and the only way
we could learn more about our systems was by making them do things they
were not suposed to do. Those of us who sat through the reigns of such
legends as the Pompey Pirates and whatever American equivilents their
were. EVERYONE WHO HAS SOMETHING TO LOSE. YOU know who you are.

They have stolen our Internet. YOU know who you are. So what do we
know?

The internet is full of lamers. Those interested in hacking etc are far
more numerable now; but it is still the same small proportion that
actual have the talent and ability to UNDERSTAND the priciples behind
the underground. And what priciples are those? Simple; FREEDOM. Freedom
of thought, speech, experimentation and entry. If you can. Do.

"Do what thou will shall be the whole of the law." - Crowley.

Commercilism has taken over the internet, and we, the underground, are
never going to take it back. We lack the talent (for most of the true
talent become part of the corporate scene long before they understand
the underground - More $, thats all that matters to some ppl, or so it
seems...), we lack the commitment and we lack the financial backing. And
that ppl is what the net is all about these days; money. And it should
make you all sick.

And I know SOMEone has to be paid to run ISP's, I have never disputed
that, or any other obvious and needed source of
employment/commerce/revenue by the internet; its the excess of these
money making schemes and rampant commercialism that is the problem; it
corrupts on a biblical scale.

Example (one of hundreds in my head): Commercial pr0n companys all
offer "illegal" pictures, If you look hard enough (I say name and
fuckin' shame them). How can that be seen as right compared to hacking?
I dont know, but somehow it is. Mitnick ends up in prison, the owners of
these companys end up on the New York Stock Market. Its sick, nothing
more and nothing less.

So the Internet is lost, what can we do?

The underground existed long before the internet did. And certainly
long before the net was accessable to those early hackers and phreaks.
So... what did we all do before the internet you 'lil script kiddies
ask; not being able to fucking comprehend the idea of no IRC in hacking,
no just emailing something to someone, no downloading of warez from an
easy to reach website, no NOTHING you are used to, or every likly to
have to get used to?!... well. We distributed manualy. Thats right. Hand
to hand. Through friends (Thats why we're not all assholes like you
AOL-Generation fuckwits - We needed the contacts.) And as for hacking
and phreaking? Phreaking need have nothing to do with the net, and
although hacking as a medium generally needs to use the net these days
(Corporate/uni BB's now being rare). Their are other ways...

So whats he ranting about now?

The net is lost; maybe its time the underground found an alternative
medium, and defended it with far more vigor than we ever did the

though this sick commercialism, the underground will cease to exist in a
haze of lamers and script kiddies.

<Nurgle> Those Shootings...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last year, 2 students walked into their school and decided to kill everyone.
This is not a Good Thing (tm). Since the incident, everything from music to
religion has been blamed. Christians have blamed the atheists for their
actions, atheists have blamed the Christians. This is 100% bullshit. The
people who should be blamed for the shootings are the kids who took the guns
to school.

However, what caused them to take the guns into school in the first place?
Was it a desire to kill anyone with any religious tendencies at their
school? I don't think so. Eric Harris and Dylon Klebold exhibited a
different way thinking, and everyone know people are scared of what is
different. As a result of this, everyone, with no exceptions, will challenge
change. I do it, you all do it. To challenge this change, some people resort
to plain ol' persecution to prevent it from happening.

Now, as a result of this persecution, some people feel isolated, and resort
to desperate measures to make their voices heard, be it running into a
school armed to streaking accross a football game. Eric and Dylon (I'm not
justifying their actions in any way here) wanted to be heard, and they could
only think of one way of doing it, by lashing out at the people who
persecuted them for being different.

How do I know all this? Because 2 years ago I nearly did exactly the same
thing. All through my high school years I was persecuted for being who I
was, and I isolated myself from society. However, instead of lashing out
against the society I was hiding from, I decided a better way of making my
voice heard was to say "fuck it" and just be myself at all times. Now, I
still get persecuted, but now I can just sit there smugly knowing that I'm
better than them, and let their petty insults just bounce right off me.

1 last point I'd like to make on the subject: Marilyn Manson was blamed for
the high school shooting, but anyone who has ever listened to any of his
music (I mean really listened) will know that this is wrong. Take, for
example, the song "The Beautiful People". At first, this song sounds like a
"I'm gonna kill you all" sorta song. WRONG. Listen closer. IMNSHO, this song
is about the people who persecute those are different.

When British Prime Minister Tony Blair was embarrassed by the leak of an internal document, a politically digestible explanation was needed. Since computer attacks are hot news, it seems that diverting political embarrassment to the computer underground offers a convenient relief from the public heat. [Credit to HNN - www.Hackernews.com]

[A Sound Argument]
A Murderer who killed and ate a priest said he would not commit the same crime again because he had become a vegetarian. After being freed from prison after 12 years, Noberto Manero said: "People need not fear me for I eat only cabbage and lentils. In jail, I converted to Islam and became a vegetarian so it would be strickly against my beliefs to eat anyone at all now." He also asked his parole officer to move hom to the north of the Phillippines because there were very few priests there. - Metro 26.07.00. [Well thats okay then - PaRiS]

[Since Britain passed its Regulation of Investigatory]
Powers (RIP) Bill, security experts have examined the
technology behind the e-mail snooping that is allowed in
the law. Allegedly, the technology is extremely easy for
savvy computer users to avoid (i.e. the sort of people
that the government hopes to catch in illegal acts). If
the cybercriminals can bypass the tap with ease, then
whose e-mail gets scanned? Answer: ordinary people.
That's why a number of experts are explaining to
citizens what steps are necessary to remain invisible to
the RIP's black boxes. 

[Regulation? We Doubt it...]
Over 100 countries lack the laws necessary to fight crimes committed via the Internet, law enforcement officials say. And the Internet offers the unique opportunity to commit a crime in a given country remotely, thereby avoiding any local laws that may apply to the illegal activity. As supporting evidence for the concept of an international law, the U.S. Department of Defense claims that it has fended off over 22,000 attacks in the past year. - CNN.

<PaRiS> Napster...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now for a long time I wasn't at all sure if I was for the whole Napster thing; after all I write music myself, would I be happy distributing my stuff for free? Then it his me. I would be happy; I have always said Im in anything for the fame not the money. And this "Consideration" proved that to me. And although Napster to me has  always sounded a bit like Warez for complete lamers, I digress, if I was opposed thousands would lable me a hypocrite. Piracy is Piracy after all but wait...

Lets put this in perspective; and from my own personal view. Theoretically I could download any alubum/song ever produced. Someone somewhere would probably have it. However. I dont. I still buy CD's. Why? No... Im not mental. I actually like the CD's. Possession of a thing is a big consideration. Or should be.

And as for the artists who are complaining about Napster; You in it for the money? Or in it for the love? Maybe you should ask yourselves. (And BTW... Napster is still up; despite the ruling. If they think its going anywhere they are sadly mistaken.)

<JerichoZZ> Know YOUR Terrorists: ABU NIDAL.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there ever was a terrorist group to read about this is it... I reckon 
this group was more like SOL than any other...  To prove, I had added my own 
commentary in brackets.

ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION LED BY SABRI AL-BANNA (AKA ABU
NIDAL "FATHER OF STRUGGLE").  SPLIT FROM FATAH IN 1974.  COMPOSED OF VARIOUS
FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEES, INCLUDING MILITARY, POLITICAL, ETC.

(- Basically, they are hard and brainy with much respect to daddy -)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVITIES:
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CARRIED OUT MORE THAN
90 TERRORIST OPERATIONS SINCE 1973-74 IN APPROXIMATELY 20 COUNTRIES, KILLING
OR INJURING ALMOST 900 PEOPLE.  THE ANO PRIMARILY TARGETS THE UNITED STATES,
UNITED KINGDOM, ISRAEL, EUROPEAN NATIONS, JEWS OF ANY NATIONALITY, THE PLO,
VARIOUS ARAB NATIONS.   THE ANO'S METHODS OF OPERATION INCLUDE ARMED ATTACKS
ON AIRPORTS, HIJACKINGS, ARMED ATTACKS ON PUBLIC GATHERING PLACES, BOMBINGS,
ASSASSINATIONS, AND KIDNAPPINGS.  THE GROUP'S ATTACKS ARE NOTED FOR THEIR
FEROCITY AND THEIR INTENTIONS OF CAUSING MASSIVE CASUALTIES.

(- Rule number 1 of starting a terrorists group, attack USA... even if has 
nothing to do with your cause.  Rule number 2, big up your status to other 
groups fighting the same cause, and kill them -)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTH:
SEVERAL HUNDRED PLUS MILITIA IN LEBANON, PLUS AN OVERSEAS SUPPORT
STRUCTURE.

(- I reckon the next SOL meet should be in Lebanon, we could start our own 
group against libertysurf or something. -)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOCATION/AREA OF OPERATION:
THE ANO WAS HEADQUARTERED IN IRAQ (1974-83) AND SYRIA (1983-87);
CURRENTLY MAINTAINS A PRESENCE IN LIBYA WITH A SUBSTANTIAL PRESENCE IN
LEBANON.  THE ANO ALSO MAINTAINS A PRESENCE IN ALGERIA AS WELL AS IN OTHER
NATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.  SOME ELEMENTS OF THE ANO MAY HAVE
RELOCATED TO IRAQ FROM LIBYA IN MID-1990.  THE GROUP HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS
ABILITY TO OPERATE OVER A WIDE GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING THE MIDDLE EAST,
EUROPE, AFRICA, AND ASIA.

(- A well guarded caravan (with toilet facility) moving around the Arab 
badlands with 700 soldiers -)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTERNAL AID:
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT,
INCLUDING SAFEHAVEN, TRAINING, LOGISTICAL ASSISTANCE, AND FINANCIAL AID
FROM IRAQ, SYRIA, AND LIBYA.  THE GROUP CONTINUES TO RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM
LIBYA, IN ADDITION TO CLOSE LOGISTICAL AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST
OPERATIONS.

(- A government run terroist group, is that possible??? -)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POLITICAL OBJECTIVES/TARGET AUDIENCES:
*PLACE THE "ARMED STRUGGLE" AGAINST THE "ZIONIST ENEMY" AS THE FIRST
  PRIORITY OF THE PALESTINE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT;
*UNDERMINE EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE AN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE BY
  TERRORIZING PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS AND BY ATTACKING ISRAELI AND JEWISH
  TARGETS;
*THREATEN OR ATTACK "REACTIONARY" REGIMES IN EGYPT, JORDAN, KUWAIT,
  SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE GULF SHEIKDOMS;
*AFFIRM ARAB COMMITMENT TO THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL;
*INTIMIDATE THOSE NATIONS CURRENTLY HOLDING ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES IN
  PRISON INTO RELEASING THEM.

(- Kill thew Zionist's, erm who are they exactly, doesn't matter kill them 
any way! -)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND:
A REJECTIONIST AND EXTREMELY VIOLENT TERRORIST GROUP, THE ANO OPPOSES
ALL EFFORTS TOWARD POLITICAL RECONCILIATION OF THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.
THE GROUP CONTENDS THAT BOTH INTER-ARAB AND INTRA-PALESTINIAN TERRORISM ARE
NEEDED TO PRECIPITATE AN ALL-EMBRACING ARAB REVOLUTION THAT ALONE CAN LEAD
TO THE LIBERATION OF "OCCUPIED PALESTINE."


(- Of course, an Arab revolution... any one seen 'The Siege'?? -)

THE ANO IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORIST GROUP IN EXISTENCE, AND ITS AREA
OF OPERATIONS IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE.  THE GROUP MADE ITS INITIAL
APPEARANCE AFTER THE OCTOBER 1973 ARAB-ISRAELI WAR WHEN YASSIR ARAFAT
DECIDED TO RESTRICT TERRORIST OPERATIONS TO ISRAELI TARGETS.  ABU NIDAL
DECIDED TO FIGHT ANY EFFORT AT MODERATION BY CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS AGAINST ISRAELI TARGETS AND BY TARGETING PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS
AND MODERATE ARAB STATES.  THE RIFT BETWEEN ABU NIDAL AND ARAFAT BECAME SO
INTENSE THAT ABU NIDAL WAS TRIED IN ABSENTIA AND SENTENCED TO DEATH BY
ARAFAT.  SINCE ITS FOUNDING, THE ANO HAS ALSO TARGETED THOSE NATIONS HOLDING
ITS OPERATIVES AS PRISONERS.

(- Their mothers tuck them in at night and read bed time storys.  They 
refuse to sleep without their teddy bears -)

AS ABU NIDAL'S FOLLOWING GREW, THE GROUP'S OPERATIONS AGAINST
PALESTINIAN MODERATES ESCALATED.  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 1978, THE ANO
ASSASSINATED THREE PROMINENT PLO OFFICIALS, WHO WERE ALLIES OF ARAFAT.
ALTHOUGH A TEMPORARY RAPPROCHEMENT TOOK PLACE IN 1978, THE ANO CONTINUES TO
TARGET MODERATE PALESTINIAN ELEMENTS.

(- Kill the zionists and fight the PLO, how hard are we?? -)

DESPITE ITS SUPPORT BY A SUCCESSION OF STATE SPONSORS THE GROUP MAINTAINS 
ITS
OWN POLITICAL AGENDA.  ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE ANO'S OPERATIONS COINCIDE WITH
THE INTERESTS OF ITS SPONSORS, THE GROUP ALSO CONDUCTS INDEPENDENT
OPERATIONS.

(- Yes give us money, we'll do what we want with it -)

THE ANO IS FINANCIALLY SOUND AND MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY VIABLE
OF ALL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GROUP IS BELIEVED TO DRAW ONE THIRD OF
ITS INCOME FROM PATRON STATES, ONE THIRD FROM GRAFT OR BLACKMAIL/EXTORTION,
AND ONE THIRD FROM ITS OWN NETWORK OF BUSINESSES AND FRONT ORGANIZATIONS.

(- zionists don't want to live on Handouts, sending just £5 a month will 
help the ANO to help zionists to kill themselves... -)

<M. Mitchell Waldrop> Quantum Computing... (Submitted by JerichoZZ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computers that tap the bizarre properties of subatomicparticles might
calculate with awesome speed-cracking codes that stymie conventional
machines.

By M. Mitchell Waldrop

"Every so often," says Isaac Chuang, sitting in his office at IBM's Almaden
Research Center in San Jose, "something new comes along in physics, and
everybody says 'Wow!' Then they get caught up in a whirlwind." In the 1970s,
the whirlwind was chaos theory. In the late 1980s, it was high-temperature
superconductivity. And now?

"Quantum computing," says Chuang, a slender, soft-spoken physicist who has
already emerged as one of the leaders in this esoteric-sounding field with
potentially enormous impact.

A quantum computer operates by the rules of quantum weirdness, down in the
subatomic realm where our everyday intuitions are violated wholesale. This
is a world in which an electron can be in two places at once, in which an
atomic nucleus can be spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same
time. It is a bizarre world in which matter itself dissolves into a ghostly
blur of possibilities as soon as you try to look at it.

And yet this surreal world is one in which you can do computing, insists
Chuang, whose group at Almaden is one of several that have demonstrated the
basic principles in the lab. If he and his fellow researchers can ever scale
up their demonstrations into practical machines, the payoff will be
enormous. Quantum computers could tackle problems that would stymie their
conventional counterparts-easily cracking, for instance, the most
sophisticated encryption schemes now in use.

Hence the new whirlwind. "It's easy for quantum computing to sound like a
fanciful theorist's dream," says physicist Neil Gershenfeld of the MIT Media
Lab. "But just extrapolating Moore's Law, the scaling relation that says
microchips shrink by a factor of two every two years or so, somewhere around
the year 2020 or 2030 is when we hit one bit per atom-and when a new
semiconductor fabrication plant will cost the gross national product of the
planet. So if we really want to keep getting faster, there aren't many other
places to turn. Quantum weirdness is essentially the only resource we have
that's still untapped for computing. It's the only big thing that's left in
the universe."


A New Kind of Bit
Actually, when quantum computing started out, it was a fanciful theorist's
dream-the late Richard Feynman's, most notably. The famously whimsical Nobel
laureate first started pushing the idea in 1981, following an earlier
suggestion by Argonne National Laboratory physicist Paul Benioff. Others
quickly followed Feynman's lead. And by the time Ike Chuang first
encountered quantum computing in the late 1980s, shortly after receiving his
undergraduate physics degree from MIT, a cadre of at least half a dozen
physicists and computer scientists were actively working in the field.

Certainly Chuang was smitten. "I've always wanted to know what information
is in a physical sense-and to understand what physics is in terms of
information," he says. Quantum computing seemed like a completely new way to
understand them both.

Take this business of encoding information, he says: The subatomic world is
full of yes-no choices that make it downright easy. Most particles-including
electrons, protons and even the ephemeral packets of light called
photons-possess a kind of built-in rotary motion known as "spin." So if your
subatomic computer used electrons, for example, you could say that an
electron spinning in one direction represented a binary 1, while an electron
spinning in the opposite direction represented a 0. And once you encode the
information, says Chuang, the subatomic world also offers any number of ways
to process it. By manipulating the magnetic environment of electrons, say,
or by routing photons through an array of polarizers, mirrors and beam
splitters, you could subject your quantum bits to all the operations
required by a digital computer.

But there would also be a critical difference. Conventional computers
followed the rules of binary logic, governed by an ironclad either-or
distinction: Each bit of information is either true or false, on or off, one
or zero. To enforce this distinction, conventional machines represent each
bit as the presence or absence of a few zillion electrons collected in a
tiny silicon transistor, so that the zillions are either there or they are
not.

But once you get down to the level of individual particles, says Chuang,
almost nothing is absolute. An electron, for example, could be spinning one
way or the other-but it could also exist as a kind of mixture of spins.
According to the laws of quantum physics, you could say the electron has a
probability of spinning one way or the other. But unless you actually made a
measurement and forced the issue, you couldn't know which it was; in a
sense, the electron itself would be undecided. And that, in turn, means that
each bit of quantum information could be undecided. Instead of being
either-or, a quantum "qubit" could be both-and: representing 0 and 1
simultaneously.

This ambiguity has a powerful consequence that becomes more apparent when
you think of not one but two qubits. These qubits could simultaneously exist
as a combination of all possible two-bit numbers: (00), (01), (10) and (11).
Add a third qubit and you could have a combination of all possible three-bit
numbers: (000), (001), (010), (011), (100), (101), (110) and (111). This
kind of system scales exponentially: n qubits can stand for 2n numbers at
once. Line up a mere 40 qubits, and you could represent every binary number
from zero to more than a trillion-simultaneously.

Furthermore, says Chuang, just as a collection of quantum qubits could
represent a huge array of numbers simultaneously, a quantum computer could
process every possible input simultaneously-the most perfect form of
parallel processing imaginable. Given the right kind of problem and a
sufficient supply of qubits, a quantum computer could outpace its
conventional counterparts by many orders of magnitude. "I read about all
this," says Chuang, remembering his first encounter with Feynman's articles
around 1987 or so, "and from then on, I wanted to build a quantum computer."


Algorithm Attack
But how? Feynman and the other theoreticians had focused on quantum
computing as a mathematical abstraction-and with good reason. "Building a
real quantum computer is a viciously difficult task," says Chuang.
Everything depends on making sure the qubits retain their incredibly fragile
quantum-mechanical mix of 1 and 0-what physicists refer to as staying
"coherent." One bump from a stray air molecule, one twitch in the magnetic
field, one ricochet of a random photon, and coherency vanishes. Let that
happen in a quantum computer and your qubits will instantly collapse from
both-and to either-or-meaning that you will suddenly find yourself looking
at an ordinary computer full of ordinary 1s and 0s.

"Quantum mechanics goes away when you look at it," sighs Chuang. "So you
have to make sure that the computer is extremely well isolated from the rest
of the world." But the isolation can't be total, either, since you still
need to put data in and read out the results. "This," Chuang declares, "is
the discord that stalks quantum computing. How can you control it if, at the
same time, you have to leave it alone?"

As the 1980s became the 1990s, many researchers continued to grapple with
the problem. Chuang even made it the subject of his doctoral dissertation at
Stanford. But nothing they proposed seemed feasible. And with no compelling
application at hand, quantum computing seemed destined for the same
cul-de-sac as countless other exotic pieces of science.

Two developments-one theoretical, one practical-have rescued quantum
computing from irrelevancy, explains MIT physicist Seth Lloyd. On the
theoretical side, it was a factoring algorithm discovered by Peter Shor of
AT&T Research labs-an achievement that went right to the heart of modern
cryptography. In most current encryption schemes, including those used to
send credit-card numbers and other sensitive information across the
Internet, an eavesdropper can break the code of a given message only by
factoring a very large number. Now, factoring small numbers is trivial-grade
school kids learn that 12 = 2 x 2 x 3. But factoring large numbers is one of
the quintessentially hard problems in computer science. No matter how clever
the algorithms, in fact, the time required to factor larger and larger
numbers grows exponentially. Go beyond a few hundred digits, and even the
fastest machines in the world will be overwhelmed: The factoring time will
vastly exceed the lifetime of the universe.

Or rather, it will with a conventional computer. Shor proved that a quantum
computer could factor large numbers in a time that increases only as some
power of the numbers' size-rapid growth, to be sure, but not remotely as
explosive as exponential growth. Indeed, a conventional computer would need
to crank away for billions of years to factor a 400-digit number. A quantum
machine could do the job in about a year. The implication was that
"unbreakable" codes might now be breakable. And with that announcement, the
National Security Agency, the Pentagon, the cryptography community, and
indeed, the whole computer community woke up to the fact that quantum
computing wasn't a theorist's plaything anymore. Peter Shor was holding out
the possibility of a real and critically important application.

Meanwhile, on the experimental side, quantum computing was beginning to look
much more possible in the lab. In 1993, for example, Lloyd brought the
mathematical abstractions down to earth when he showed how quantum
computation could be carried out by qubits arranged in a regular array-just
the kind of quantum computer that might actually get built. Then in 1996,
Chuang and MIT's Gershenfeld made things even more concrete when they
suddenly saw a way to build it.

"I went into Ike's office on a Monday and didn't emerge until Friday,"
laughs Gershenfeld, thinking back to the quantum computing conference that
brought him to the University of California at Santa Barbara and the
Institute for Theoretical Physics, where Chuang had a postdoc appointment.
"We got this feeling that comes along only rarely, that there was this
beautiful structure already existing in the world, and that we were seeing
it for the first time."

That structure became apparent as soon as they decided to forget about
electrons or photons, and instead make their qubits at the heart of the
atom: the nucleus. Actually, it is the nucleus's building blocks-protons and
neutrons-that have spin. While individual spins tend to pair up and cancel
each other out, in some isotopes a few are left over, leaving a net spin in
one direction or another.

Nuclear qubits were appealing for several reasons. First, you can make a
perfectly fine qubit out of any nuclear isotope that has a spin-as many do.
Second, says Gershenfeld, "this is the most coherent system in the
universe." Every nucleus is protected from outside disturbances by its dense
cloud of electrons. That means that once you get its spin lined up, it will
stay that way for hours or days-an eon in computer time. Third, nuclear
qubits are incredibly easy to assemble. "Instead of trying to nanofabricate
nanostructures," says Gershenfeld, "we can just use the ones nature gave us:
molecules." Moreover, he points out, the nuclear spins inside a given
molecule tend to interact nicely. Take chloroform, for example, a molecule
consisting of a carbon atom attached to three chlorine atoms and one
hydrogen atom: When the hydrogen nucleus and the carbon nucleus are spinning
the same way, their energy levels will be measurably different from when
they are spinning opposite from one another.

Finally, says Gershenfeld, the technology for manipulating these nuclear
spins is already very mature. It's called nuclear magnetic resonance, or
NMR, and it is routinely used in chemical analysis and in hospital magnetic
resonance imaging scanners. It's a simple matter to adapt commercial NMR
spectrometers to do quantum computing.

Say you want to carry out a logical operation using chloroform-something
like, "If carbon is 1, then hydrogen is 0." You just suspend the chloroform
molecules in a solvent, and put a sample in the spectrometer's main magnetic
field to line up the nuclear spins. Then you hit the sample with a brief
radio-frequency pulse at just the right frequency. The hydrogen spin will
either flip or not flip, depending on what the carbon is doing-exactly what
you want for an if-then operation. By hitting the sample with an
appropriately timed sequence of such pulses, moreover, you can carry out an
entire quantum algorithm-without ever once having to peek at the nuclear
spins and ruin the quantum coherence.

So there it was, Chuang and Gershenfeld realized: NMR was a natural for
quantum computing. They were not alone. Chuang remembers being "surprised
and delighted" to learn that Harvard University NMR expert David Cory and
his colleagues were independently making exactly the same proposal. For
researchers of Cory's caliber to enter the field constituted more of an
endorsement of the NMR idea than a rivalry, Chuang believed. In any case,
there was plenty of work to go around. By this point, Lloyd recalls, with
researchers having identified a real application for quantum computing plus
a feasible technique for making it work, "all hell was breaking loose" in
the field. "All of a sudden there was this wonderful new game to play."

The game has only gotten better. In just the past few years, for example,
Shor and others have shown that quantum computers needn't be as fragile as
researchers once feared; a variety of quantum error-correction schemes will
allow the devices to undo the damage caused by environmental perturbations
and restore their qubits to full coherence. Lov Grover of Lucent
Technologies' Bell Labs has discovered a quantum search algorithm that is
substantially faster than its best classical counterpart. Chuang himself has
used NMR to demonstrate Grover's algorithm, first on a two-qubit quantum
computer-a chloroform molecule-and more recently on a three-qubit molecule.
Along the way, Chuang and Gershenfeld's partnership has expanded into a
nationwide consortium for quantum computing research, including members from
MIT, Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley, IBM and several
other industrial partners. Cory's team, which is working on an NMR
demonstration of Shor's algorithm, has likewise broadened into a Harvard-MIT
collaboration. Both groups are among those getting money from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency-the arm of the Defense Department that
essentially invented the Internet-as part of the first significant federal
funding initiative for quantum computing.


Making "Magic"
None of this means that we'll be trading in our PCs for quantum laptops
anytime soon. Quantum computing is barely into its proof-of-principle stage,
with a long way to go before it evolves even to the qubit equivalent of
World War II-era vacuum-tube machines like the ENIAC. Much more likely are
quantum add-ons to conventional machines-"coprocessors" that will perform
specific tasks in the same way that a graphics card takes over the most
difficult display chores.

What exactly those tasks will be, however, is an unsettled question. MIT
physicist Edward Farhi points out that the study of quantum algorithms is
still in its infancy. The two best ones discovered so far-Shor's and
Grover's-will doubtless be followed by many more, opening up applications
that go well beyond factoring and searching. Nonetheless, says Farhi, "a
quantum computer isn't necessarily fast. It's a device that attacks problems
in a different way. We're still trying to understand what makes a problem
amenable to that kind of attack. You have to choose your problem carefully
to take advantage of the quantum magic."

In practice, adds Farhi, how quantum coprocessors are used could depend a
lot on how much they cost. And that's a complicated issue. At IBM Almaden,
for example, the core of Chuang's quantum computer is small and inexpensive:
qubit-containing molecules dissolved in a few drops of colorless solvent,
encased in a glass tube smaller than his little finger. But the NMR
spectrometer that makes the computer go is a silvery, 10-foot-tall cylinder
surrounded by great thickets of wires and plumbing-most of it required to
service the liquid helium that chills the spectrometer's superconducting
magnets. If future quantum coprocessors follow this pattern, they will be
huge, multimillion-dollar behemoths that fill up whole rooms, and that only
governments can afford. In that case, quantum computers may well be
restricted to hard-core national security tasks such as cryptography and
intelligence-gathering.

But such an outsized contraption may not be inevitable. Gershenfeld's group
at the MIT Media Lab is working on a compact, room-temperature NMR computer.
They hope this device will be a prototype of a quantum coprocessor that will
power inexpensive little gadgets-peripherals that will sit on the desktop
like a modern-day printer or scanner. If that proves to be the pattern, then
we could see a new generation of quantum hackers going to work in much the
same way their forebears did at the beginning of the personal computer
revolution, creating a profusion of innovative quantum software.

In the meantime, however, Chuang and his fellow experimenters are far less
concerned with their machines' physical size than with their qubit count.
"The first year we had lots of wonderful one-qubit machines popping up all
over the place," he says. "Now at IBM we have a three-qubit computer, and
we're planning even larger computers." In March, Los Alamos National
Laboratory announced a seven-qubit NMR computer, and Chuang is confident
that one lab or another will soon be demonstrating molecules with as many as
10 qubits. He concedes that this will be a tricky task, however. "Say I want
a molecule with certain properties. When I draw it and go to the chemists,
they just laugh: 'That's not real!' They call it a 'physicist's molecule.'"
One complication is that carbon, the key ingredient of all complex
molecules, almost invariably occurs as the isotope carbon-12-which is
spinless. Chuang's chloroform computer worked only because its molecules
were made with the rare and expensive isotope carbon-13, which does spin.

Yet a truly useful quantum computer will need hundreds or even thousands of
qubits. Presumably, says Chuang, that means some kind of long-chain polymer.
But developing the right kind of polymer, figuring out how to stabilize it,
and then learning how to do NMR with it-that all adds up to many more years
of research. And that's if NMR is the final answer for quantum computing-a
prospect that is no more guaranteed than that vacuum tubes were the final
answer for conventional electronic computers. Ultimately, a practical
quantum device might take some other form entirely. In the "ion trap"
approach, for example, the qubits are ionized atoms suspended in an
oscillating electric field. This approach has proved fiendishly difficult to
implement, despite some preliminary success by physicist Christopher R.
Monroe and his team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Boulder, Colo. But if the ion trap idea ever pans out, it will be a
remarkably clean and elegant system to program. Alternatively, there are
"quantum dots" in which the qubits would be electrons trapped in an array of
tiny structures etched onto the surface of a silicon crystal (see past
issue: "Quantum Dot Com," TR January/February 2000). Then there is the
liquid crystal approach, the crystal lattice approach-on and on.

The myriad possibilities are limited only by your imagination, says
Gershenfeld-which is precisely why quantum computing has stirred up so much
excitement. "This has the feel of being a whole new science," he declares.
"Computer scientists are having to learn physics, and that doesn't quite fit
into their intellectual framework. Physicists are having to learn computer
science, and that doesn't quite fit into their framework. Quantum computing
breaks down the institutional boundaries at almost any institution you can
name. And every side is the richer for learning a new language for
describing the world."

But perhaps an even deeper reason for the excitement is the way quantum
computing expands our intellectual horizons. "I'm not just doing this for
the sake of quantum computing," says Chuang. "I'm doing it because so little
is known about computing in general. For 50 years we've just focused on one
technique in computing": that is, microchips based on the on-off dichotomy
of binary logic. The pursuit of quantum computing, Chuang believes,
addresses a fundamental issue: "What does it take to perform a
computation-and how can we manipulate nature's laws to perform the
computation we want? That is the more basic question that quantum computing
brings out."

<PaRiS> Tell you what Really pisses me off... (Mindless Rantings of a bitter man)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Its a state which is hard to describe, but one that everyone of you will I have no doubt be familiar with; and then realise the implications of. You know what Im talking about; when you look at someone, and you KNOW they think that have gotten one over on you. They wont say it, hell, most of the time they wont even talk to you; but you know what they are thinking. That SMUG look.

Smugness is perhaps the most annoying thing that the human pyche is guilty of creating; and we all do it. Lets face it during our lives we will all do just about everything that a human can? (With the exception of certain explicit sexual act which are well, more a matter of preference than anything else...). But its those people, and you KNOW who you are that are for certain times in thier lives are constantly smug and conceited about everything that REALLY piss me off. In my opinion in comes down to a "Stop/Start Self-Confidence", which produces confidence and paranoia in obscenely unbalanced preportions at any one time. ie. The individual is either really over confident, or sadly under confident. The real fucker about this is the fact that they usualy dont see it like this, and thus are really unwilling to change it. Perhaps because the people close to them only notice them (and thus their crappy behavior) when they being over confident assholes (This not looking after your mates is however another matter, and does nto excuse anyones malicious behavoir); and by then a kind of social battle ground has usually been created. A waste of youth, time and effort. 

And lets not delude ourselves, or them; these people usually spend about 80% of their lives really pissed off, with no self confidence before to occational something will happen, by accident rather than design in most cases that will change this, a new GF, a new found sense of "Im funny". Whatever. It can be anything and then... THEY ARE OFF.

The phrase "ego-trip" does not even come near what will happen in the next few weeks or months. The tragedy of these people is that they dont REALISE that the reason they spend 80% of their lives in the shit is because they are such an asshole when they aint there and people are forced to put a stop to their sucess when they achieve it because they are so, so, so SMUG about it. And usually dont think twice about fucking other people over if they think their social position can be improved by the act in question.

Its the same principle with "Im God" @'s in channels on IRC (Notably #radio1 on xnet but if you want a more historical reference take #amirc on DALnet). These people DELIGHT in putting others down; because they are having what they see as a moment of glory. Makes you wonder why they feel the need to come on IRC? Just to put people down? Act "Big"? Surely that gives us an insight into their irl social lives, and then you can do nothing but either laugh or feel sorry for them; or both. Its a twisted world in which we live.

Behavior such as this is a social disease and I honestly feel that its the root of most problems. And what does it boil down to? Jealously - That inherent "Blip" in humanity which screams that an individual wants more, or wants to FEEL more than his fellow man - A Shakesperian tradegy if EVER I heard one and a theory which can be closely related to the age old statement "The roots of a mans destruction can be found in his own evil". 

And the REASONS? The pychological analysis? These people constantly feel that they have to prove something to everyone; "Look how hard I am", "Look how kool I am", "Look how fit my Girl friend is" (Which is really fucking funny when she is a minger). The word insecure is the only one that goes far enough to describe why they do it. And there is nothing wrong with being insecure. It only becomes a problem when an individuals insecuritys start to affect the happiness of others; its only THEN when act of ANTI-Social behavoir such as "Smugness (aka Hidden Jelously)" becomes a real issue. Lets face it no one really gives a fuck unless they are feeling it? You know what I mean?

Which brings me to my sad conclusion. "No mattah how much we see those playah haters in disguise". We aint never gonna be able to stop' em. Because, in doing so, we would be no better than they. Instead we can only feel sorry for them; and brew away at the wickedness of the world, and watch who sides with them. Because ladys and gents there is only one thing worse than a real grade A playah hater. And that my friends is a sheep.

Last comments of a man on a defeated battle ground? Well, I see it all, and Im still smiling; I wonder how long they will be?

<JerichoZZ> Mission Log...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** The SOL missions Log... *** 

*** corny intro *** 

These are the voyages of the of the SOL, its continuing misson... to explore strange new bars, to seek out new drinks and drink them... To boldy get as pissed as no man has got before! 

*** Misson number 53674: This has no relevence... but it is necessary *** 

*** Primary Objectives *** 

1) link up - JerichoZZ + |PARIS| + crew 2) Get sloshed 

*** Secondary objectives *** 

1) For some reason we all seem practically married, [Some of us to more than one girl at a time :)) - Ed] so no bird pullin? 
2) Start a fight, Well why the fuck not! 

*** Status *** 

Ok, its June 2000, I is still livin in France. I gots to back to London to do some shit for other people... independent brain thought occurs, I must re-live the session! I Phonez |PARIS|, meeting Friday in pub, not our usual (closed down - turning in to O'Niels) but our old meeting place, an Irish pub with (crap) live music. I said I would meet another friend there also... her friends didn't show and she mix well with the crew so she left early. Leaving me without obligation to get phucked. 

*** RESULT *** 

We arrive at said pub and start to consume, lots. I remember not having any money (I hadn't been in paid employment for 5 months). Thus a change in roles had occured, |Paris| now money making was sponsoring me... As well as the rest of the crew buying me drinks for old times sake... |Paris|'s new-sort-of-seeing-but-gives-good-head-bird was there so he was not really going talent spoting. Me being tied up with Missus back in France and my desire to be a good boy ment that we were limited to drunkeness and having a laugh... this is also something never before tried. Many discussions arise on why I am in France? Why I shouldn't be in France? And how I should be back in London keeping it real? but alas I am on a mission at the momment, tring to obtain the easy life. Having had free drinks thrown at me it is now closing time and I is sloshed... but the night is not over... refusing to allow ourselves to fall below the standard and show ourselves at local club, we walk by laughing... I speak to Bouncer friend of mine, he offers |PARIS| new job with more money... |Paris| is still in negotiations I believe. We look to go to late licence Austrialian pub... why not? many a good night was had in the past. |Paris|'s new-sort-of-seeing-but-gives-good-head-bird left to do something else. We arrive at cab office... |Paris| tries to get a cab by demanding an innocent person with no affiliation any cab firm other than prehaps a paying customer takes us to said pub and attempts to barter for a good price... this man is clearly stoned and laughs at him, meanwhile a less drunk member of our party gets us a real cab... As all this is going on I get in to conversation with random people, I confinced one bloke I was going to be in involved in an orgy that very night, I dunno how but random bird started taking a liking to me and as I was talking, her boyfriend got closer and closer hugging her until she was completly enveloped by him thus canceling conversation. This didn't bother me for she was fuckin ugly... We get in cab... We pull faces at other cars we pass, much laughs occur. We arrive in our rude boy fashion, but settle down as we remember that if you are not Austrialian then you get your head kicked in... We remember old days on a previous session (seesion log 35647) When we arrived at this same pub (RedBack) and left without even queing because we saw a sign sayin "Abba night". We check sign, it didn't mention any form of Abba, we stayed in que. Bouncers came and spoke to us, they were unusually nice... I think nothing of it, and find out the the que is 30 mins long. 2 minutes later more bouncers come over and are even nicer to us, we query the bouncer. JerichoZZ s'up? security1 LISTEN UP PEOPLE PLEASE STAND BACK AGAINST THE WALL. DO NOT URINATE IN THE QUE. WE HAVE PROVIDED TEMPORARY LOOS HALF WAY DOWN THE LINE, AND AT LOCAL PETROL STATIONS. DO NOT DRINK IN THE QUE. 

<|PaRiS|> What the fuck??? 
<JerichoZZ> No pissing, he is watching ya! 
<Security2> We are under risk of losing our licence, please take one of these leaflets... 

* We all throw them on the floor.

<Security1> No littering, We have had complaints that people are urinating in gardens on the way home. 
<Security2> We have provided a Bus free of charge to take you anywhere (within 3 miles). 
<JerichoZZ> What fuckin bus??? 
<|PaRiS|> Will it take us to front of the que? 
<Security2> *Points across the road* That's is there, and no its really only for show so we can keep our licence. 
<JerichoZZ> That messed up Transit Van??? 
<Security1> Errr yea... have a leaflet! 
<JerichoZZ> I have one... 
<Security1> Have another!! 
<JerichoZZ> Yes sir.! 
<Llama> I am going to use the loo. 
<JerichoZZ> Look how convienient, its right next to the place we normally piss. I'll shall go too! 

* We in turn use these port-a-loo's what fun, We meet 2 Kiwi's in the line...amongst the regular shit we talk came a list of things that you could do with an electric toothbrush... I refuse to mention. 45 mins later... we are still in que... we sober up... this is shit... whats going on... |PaRiS| then notices work collegues, and leaves us to take the piss out of them, they were 10 people further back in the line... |PaRiS| then tries to come back... He is denied by a tall and fat twat... "No no your not pushing in fart fart bollox bollox..." So |PaRiS| is forced to wait even longer as we enter... The drinks are in, the coats are neatly put away in cloak room... Drunkeness sets in quickly as the alcohol levels are already quite high... |Paris| joins us just in time for our second round... We dance in the usual cramped fashion that the establishment allows to live music, then to DJ playing commerical dance. More drinks arrive, then the place tries to close... we leave sharpish having achieved sloshed and wanting a cab rather than walking. |Paris| sits in the front of the cab, he is gonna pay with the last of his money. We joke and laugh, and we remember the driver from another night when he took us home... he knew where to go and everything... how proper was that... The Crew part, leaving |Paris| and I to crash, but before crashing we require lunchables... we check his house... they was none to be found... we do home made ones with philadelhpia and french toast, with proper ham... We then go to crashing area with home made lunchables... I take the floor, |PAris| takes the bed. We munch. He phones his new-sort-of-seeing-but-gives-good-head-bird she is in bed with her mate (mate = fit as fuck and female) which provides an interesting conversation. |Paris| gives her ideas with an electric tooth brush... She declines. |Paris| falls unconsious... I can munch no more... I crash out... We awake with headachs... No major fights started, but a few hard pushes on the dance floor and argument with Mr. FATS in the que... Too sloshed to mention... 

*** Mission sucessful ***

<Chicken Soup> Pint Glass...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Camera focuses on an empty pint glass that slowly fills up. Throughout the scene the pint glass is followed by the camera the rest of the "action" takes place in the background with a slowly emptying glass (or two) in the foreground. The barman hands over the full glass to Ian.)
IAN:
Cheers mate
(He takes a sip and puts the glass down on a beermat.)
IAN:
Do you want one Dave?
DAVE:
Do I ever say no?
IAN:
Another one please, barman. (Pause) Did you see the game last night?
DAVE:
Oh yeah, what a cracking goal. That'll win Goal of the Month.
(Another pint is put next to the other; the shot changes to a wider angle)
IAN:
Cheers. I dunno mate, his goal the other week was a bit tasty as well.
DAVE:
I know but the angle, the technique! I don't think I've seen many better.
(One of the glasses is removed from shot and returns a little emptier)
IAN:
You know, you're probably right, as usual.
DAVE:
As usual.
(Both glasses disappear and return emptier there is an 8-second pause in conversation.)
DAVE:
So...how's work?
IAN:
Not bad...yourself?
DAVE:
Yeah, not bad.
(Once again a glass disappears returning emptier. There is another pause in conversation.)
IAN:
Do you fancy a spot of pool?
DAVE:
O.K. Take the pints over and over and I'll get the cues.
(The glasses are transferred to the pool table and placed on the edge.)
IAN:
Shall I break?
DAVE:
Go on.
(The sound of the balls being broken can be heard. Suddenly one of the glasses is knocked over. It falls in to slow motion and as it falls the hubbub of the pub is silenced until the glass shatters on the floor.)
DAVE:
Shit!
IAN:
Don't worry I'll get you another.
(The camera stays on the broken glass and then fades to black.)

<Comrade> Using the SID chip in C64 BASIC...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Spectrum may have given many gamers years of fun (and frustration) myself included but it has to be said - they were crap. Never owning a 128k model I could never experience programming in basic without looking to see which key had 'poke' written on it for 2 minutes. The only BASIC most of us wrote on the 48k was 'Load ""'. If you were lucky, and you needed to be, you might then successfully load a program. Like all great (was really) things it didn't last forever because 1984 had seen the launch of the Commodore 64 and 6 years later even I had one. With it's superior graphics, technically advanced sound, and 'positively elephantine' 64k of memory (their words, from an advert, I kid you not) it was more desirable than the 48k speccy in every respect apart from the lack of rubber keys (grr). 

Suddenly there was (almost) good sound and music to be found on a computer; the vast archives of sid tunes on the net are evidence enough of the chip's popularity. Games like 'Creatures', 'Creatures 2' (not the recent PC bollocks) and 'Mayhem in Monsterland' demonstrated what the SID chip could really add to games. Resurrected in the form of plugins and emulators you can now experience the sound all over again, reasonably authentically. (Admit it, playing a console game without taking a cart out of a box and slotting it in is nowhere near as much fun. Kids these days don't know what they're missing)

About time I ripped some specs. I've been talking about the 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID). 3 tone oscillators, 4 waveforms per oscillator (they will provide some fun later), 3 amplitude modulators, 3 envelope generators, oscillator synchronization, and ring modulation. Now that's made things a little clearer.

Besides the better technology and reliable loading, C64 BASIC was easier to use than what had been available to most before, and by default, all in upper case! You must code in upper case for authenticity. As the proud owner of a C64 manual, I have recently been looking at chapter 8 - "Making Sound and Music" and I think I should share some of it's content (before you can say 'copyright infringement')

Not misguided enough to needlessly complicate their implementation of BASIC, Commodore provided no separate BASIC commands to interface with the SID chip so we have to poke memory addresses - 54272 to 54296. 

In order to 'play' a note you have to poke the high and low frequency registers. Each requires a value from 0-255 depending on which frequency you want. (0-64kHz)
In order to determine what values to use, you can use these formulae 
F = (Your Frequency) / 0.06097
HI = INT (F/256) : REM must be an integer
LO = F - (256 * HI)

I haven't worked out what F represents; it's possibly related to the wavelength, but you know how to do it now anyway. If you do know you might tell me.
Once you've got those values and poked them you have to poke the control register, which triggers the envelope generator. You poke it once to start the note and once again to stop it. (Yes, it's as bad as that)
You may manipulate the envelope generator by poking to alter the attack, decay, sustain, and release of the note. The waveform used is specified when you start the note by poking the control register; you may choose from Triangular, Sawtooth, Pulse (pulse width is variable), and white noise. You can also set the volume (0-16) and all this (minus the volume) is specific to one of three voices, depending where you are poking (watch where you do :) ). Now a much needed table and example:

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Volume Control	 POKE 54296	O (off) to 15 (loudest)                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|   
|To Play note	 POKE           C   C#  D   D#  E   F   F#  G   G#  A	A#  B  |
|Hi Freq.	 54273		33  35  37  39  42  44  47  50  53  56  59  63 |
|Lo Freq.	 54272		135 134 162 223 62  193 107 60  57  99  190 75 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Waveform        POKE		Triangle    Sawtooth     Pulse      Noise      |
|                54276	 	17          33           65         12         |
|(Any of these start the note, use 16 to stop it)                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Pulse Rate (Pulse waveform)                                                   |
|Hi		 54275		0 to 15                                        |
|Lo		 54274		0 to 255                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Attack/Decay	 POKE		ATK4 ATK3 ATK2 ATK1 DEC4 DEC3 DEC2 DEC1        |
|		 54277		128  64   32   16   8    4    2    1           |
|(Add any of these together to produce combinations)                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Sustain/	 POKE           SUS4 SUS3 SUS2 SUS1 REL4 REL3 REL2 REL1        |
|Release 	 54278		128  64   32   16   8    4    2    1           |
|(Add any of these together to produce combinations)                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

That octave is just one of 8 available (the sixth I think). To access the second voice, add 7 to every address, and 14 for the third.
I had to reproduce the hilarious 'try these settings to simulate different instruments' table.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instrument  | Waveform   | Attack/Decay | Sustain/Release | Pulse Rate   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Piano       | Pulse      |   9          |  0              | Hi-0, Lo-255 |
| Flute       | Triangle   |   96         |  0              | n/a          |
| Harpsichord | Sawtooth   |   9          |  0              | n/a          |
| Xylophone   | Triangle   |   9          |  0              | n/a          |
| Organ       | Triangle   |   0          |  240            | n/a          |
| Colliape(?) | Triangle   |   0          |  240            | n/a          |
| Accordian   | Triangle   |   102        |  0              | n/a          |
| Trumpet     | Sawtooth   |   96         |  0              | n/a          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------| 

I'm not doing any more ascii tables for a long time.
Remember you specify the waveform when you start playing the note. The other parameters must be poked before. 

The following plays the scale of C major: (code originally by unknown but modified by Comrade)
NEW
5  FOR L = 54272 TO 54296 : POKE L,0 : NEXT // clear SID chip
10 POKE 54296, 15                           // set Volume
20 POKE 54277, 7 : POKE 54278, 133	    // set a/d/s/r
50 READ A                                   // read hi-freq 
55 IF A = -1 THEN END                       // not C++, is it?
60 READ B                                   // read lo-freq
80 POKE 54273, A : POKE 54272, B            // poke them
85 POKE 54276, 17                           // start note with triangle wave
90 FOR T = 1 TO 250 : NEXT : POKE 54276, 16 // wait, then stop it
95 FOR T = 1 TO 50 : NEXT                   // time between notes
100 GOTO 20                                 // oh dear. Not my code...
110 DATA 16, 195, 18, 209, 21, 31, 22, 96   // 5th octave C - 6th
120 DATA 25, 30, 28, 49, 31, 165, 33, 135
999 DATA -1 

There are a few other things like filtering, but if you're serious about making music or sound effects on the c64 you should get an emulator and download one of the specialist c64 programs.

Like to take the opportunity to annoy PaRiS and say greets to Klaire.

<PaRiS> The Real Underground (Please stand up)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(May I have your attention please, will the real hackers in the house please stand up. I repeat will the real Pirates in the house please stand up. Hey Bill, We're gonna have a problem here...)

Y'all act like you have'nt seen a m0dem before, 
Jaws all on the floor, like Bill Gates with a Mac just walked in the door,
And he started whippin' its ass first and before,
He burst in to commerce; dont give a damn about the core,
kicked our ass out the door; like a lil money whore.

('aaaaaight)

Its the return of the; "Oh... Wait no way, your kidding, 
He did'nt just say what I think he said, did he?"
And Terry Cooksey said... Nothing you idiots, Terry Cooksey's dead
He's locked in my cripted harddrive with that other Fed!
Script Kiddie's love SOL-SOL-SOL-SOL "We're sick 'o them,
look at them, walking around; printing you know what, and
making a lamer of you know who..."

("Yeah But PaRis is so cute though!")

Yeah, an I prolly gotta couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats going on in your daddys net cash', "stoosh",
Sometime's I just wanna get on IRC and let fly, but I cant,
But its kool for #radio1 to sell out... let the feeling die. Why? 

(My sniffers on your IP)
(My sniffers on your IP)

"And if you lucky you might just give it a little test."
And thats the message we deliver to be the best?
and expect Kids to not be so lame, you know what that is?
Hypocrits.
Of course they gonna know what nuking is by the time they hit forth grade!
They got AOL and a browser dont they? But hey...

We aint nothing but criminals, digital animals.
Well... some of us are cannabals, who hack other users;
Like fucking child abusers...
But if we can hack each other, and chat in irc, fuck, it dont matter?!
(Yeah right; you fucking lamers...)
Their aint no reason that Microsoft are gonna see, if you and me
keep acting up like a we gotta lil p',
But if you feel like I feel you got the anti-dote, sing with me now,
and girls clear ya' throats...

(Dont talk with your mouths full) Because,

Yes, We're the real underground, yes we're the real thing,
All you other lil lamers are just immitating,
So wont the real underground please stand up, please stand up?

Cos we're the real underground, yes were the real deal,
All you other lil lamers are just irritating,
So wont the real underground please stand up, please stand up? Please stand up?

"CF^ dont have to look for Warez." Well we do, so fuck you, 
and fuck them too.
You think we give a damn about your last hack?
Half of you critics cant even read, with ya long black mac...
Thinking you a phreak, or wishing you was black...
Why? 
So you can immitate the trench coat mafia, and end up dead in a sack?
With a hundred fucking fed's now breathing down our backs!
Be a gangster? Sit me here IRC, next to Pretty_Girl_Dee, 
Well lucky me, 

But She had better swap seats with Dysfunti0n, or so we hear...
Give a remark about who she cyber fucked first,  
Then stear...
The conversation to radical motivations of phear, 
Well -hey- who ever gaves a fuck - Because hoe, 
your not really here!

(Damn...)

Little girl; putting up ya' shit on my web... 
Well you don't, never have done G.
Fuck fooling me. "Dont trust no one" 
Thats the key...
"Yeah he's cute but he'll never be with me..."
I should upload a log of you, and let them see,
"Hey Mark I love you, would be with you..." - But which one bitch?
So lets leave it now - you know the word "ditch?"
I'll show the whole world how you think you be playing him, and me too.
So fuck you.

('aiiiiiiight)

Im sick of you little script kiddies and scene whores,
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you,
And there's a million of us, just like me, who cuss like me, who just
dont give a fuck like me, who dress like me, walk talk and act like me,
They just might be the next best thing but they not quite me...

Cos' I'm the real PaRiS, yes Im the real thing,
All you other lil lamers are just immitating,
So wont the real underground please stand up, please stand up?

Cos were the real underground, yes were the real underground,
All you other lil lamers are just irritating,
So wont the real underground please stand up, please stand up?

Im like a head fuck to listen to;
Because Im only giving you things you friends dream about and watch in videos
Are my words offending you?
And the only difference is I got the balls to print, say it in front of y'all,
And I aint gotta be false or sugarcoated at all,
I just get on the keybored and spit it,
Whether you like to admit it,
I just hit it,
SOL's better than 90% of you groups out tdere.
And the only one saying this shit here...

('aiiiiiiight)

Yes I'm the real PaRiS, yes Im the real thing,
All you other lil lamers are just immitating,
So wont the real underground please stand up, please stand up?

Cos were the real underground, yes were the real underground,
All you other lil lamers are just irritating,
So wont the real underground please stand up, please stand up?
