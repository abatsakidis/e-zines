(sorry about the ASCII art, not too hot at it)



(look, if you really want to know, its the CUBAN FLAG.)

Anyway, as you may have guessed, I`ve taken over as Editor of this esteemed..... publication. Gone is the "Golden Age of Paris" and now we enter the "Random Age of Llama". Random? Well, its because I have no idea of what I`m going to do, because its up to you!!!!!!, yes, thats because what goes into this journal is (mainly) written up by people who want to have a rant, make a point or generally want to write some wibble to make up the fact I can`t write *quite* that much to make it a full issue. Take this one for example. Look at the stats:-

Average issue of Soljo - 15 articles

This issue of Soljo - 8 articles.

Quite frankly, this is not enough. I`ll let you all off with a warning, due the the uh, problems inbetween the last issue and this one. I have partly written this one with Paris, who, has decided to leave SOL. So, we`ll sort all this out really. The future of SOL is now up to you guys, so again, write those articles. 
	Well, anyway, now is the time to introduce myself properly. I am Llama. I am a 2nd year biochemistry student, awaiting the disaster known as my results for the final year. I`ll keep you updated on that. My Musical influences are punk and ska punk, so you will find me listening to things like Less than Jake, Greenday et al. I am a great follower of the cult of the hawaiian shirt, much to the annoyance of nearly everybody, but I don`t care about that :). The greatest film ever in my opinion is Mallrats, which I urge everybody to go out and purchase (not that much either). Kevin Smith (the director of Mallrats) latest film, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (or something) will be out in the autumn, and from the looks of it, it will be AWESOME!. Ahem. Well, now I`m editor, I will have a rant later in the issue about the occult. Enjoy this modest issue, and I promise that the next one will be much bigger!

                                                    Have fun, Llama.

Excuses for it being late:

I`m at work

I`m at Uni

I`ve got to revise for my exams

I`ve got exams

It`s too hot

I can`t be bothered

My computer is gay

Why can`t I cut and paste on this piece of shit

Its all Paris`s fault.

On with the issue! (aha!)

(DJ_RobinB) The Timeley Death of One of Our Sponsors!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It has come to our attention that Benny Caversworth has had a great deal of
trouble with his heart of late.

We were fully aware of the fact that he was in a "semi-detched" relationship
with one of his male collegues, but had not realised that it was causing him
to consume live voles.

The doctors informed us of his timely death, which was apparently cause by
one of the voles being undigested, and eating its way into Mr Caversworth's
heart, via his lungs.

His wife was heard to utter the words "Are you quite alright dear" just as
he stuck a letter opener into his left nostril. He was apparently just about
to open a letter from his bank informing him that he was $55.80 overdrawn,
and could he please kindly contact the branch to pursue the matter. It has
been described as "highly unlikely" that this had anything to do with the
fact that he had recently bought a female stimulation instrument from a
local shop "Doms-R-Us".

Mr Caversworth was dead shortly after.

Perhaps in a strange twist of fate, as Caversworth dropped to the floor, he
stabbed his cat with the letter opener, which leapt onto the sink, and
slipped in. The cat disturbed a cockroach which had been hiding in the sink,
which fell down the plug hole, and into the mouth of the plumber who had
come round to repair a leaking stopcock. The man swallowed the cockroach
whole, and is now being treated for a heart complaint.

We welcome the arrival of our new sponsor, management under Ms Jenny
Anderson - apparently she does good head.

(PaRiS) Uk Underground Culture Rant!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am sick of UK Underground Culture being dominated by the half baked commerical dance scene masqurading as some underground phenominon. Do a search for "UK Hack Culture" on any of the main search engines and it either turns up nothing at all or a result where 90% of the sites are dance music related links. The american's may be dumb ass's but at least they have develeped their "hack" (or underground) scene (in general) from its origins, where as the UK scene seems to have just crashed and burned in commerical hell; and is now indistinguishable from 100 other "sub cultures" - all of which currupted by the establishment or to small and insignificant to be noticed by ANYone. It seems to me that the youth culture of the UK has become nothing more than drunken, drugged up idiots wearing Ben Sherman shirts content to spend all their money on clubbing while fantisising about Judge Jules. Mundane nothings. Surely the underground, and indeed our generation as a whole should mean more than that.

Dont get me wrong, music does have a part to play; but any musician who has already long ago sold out to the establishment (whom are as evil as satan himself) fucking well does NOT. And I can hear some smart ass's saying that the hack culture in america is commerical as well, even more so than our own. True; but at least it has its own identity, and with in that identity behind all the script kiddie's and sell outs still lie's the real real thing. Rather that than the nothingness which seems to identify UK hack Culture from well, anything else young people in the United Kingdom seem to do. Which isnt very much.

I hate trance music, I hate the term clubber (the reason i hate them is because both trance and the term clubber are now in geneal UK wide terms so far away from the origins of dance music, that being the rave's of the late 80's and early 90's; im not against progress. But I am against selling out. And thats what a large proportion of artists have done over the years, and thats why the scene and atmosphere of the thing have become so perverted, so fake, and so shit). To me this signifys everything thats BAD about modern music, and is only a small step away from Steps and S-Club-7. Im aware that there is an underground Trance scene were artists have not sold out to the big labels; this is good. Its just as good as the garage scene in London is, well whats survived of the garage scene after the "commercilisation" of garage by certain sell our artists. The two scenes have the same common enemy. "Sell Outs" (The enemy of all "Scene's - those who seek to make one thing [an underground scene] another [a commerical phenominon] for their own benefit [usually money of fame or both] without asking the scene as a whole whats good for the scene).

But I digress, and move back to the point; the underground today in the UK. No identity, much like England it's self, its facless. No one seems to have the conviction to make it something great anymore (out of fear, or idleness who knows?). A lack of creativity amung my peers which I alone cannot rectify. What ever happened to the scene of the early 90's? Its participants got old, thats what. And they handed the torch to a younger generation of geeks who have all but put out the flame of their good work. And the worrying thing? Im getting old too. And when Im gone from the scene forever, which i have no doubt will happen one day, I fear there will be nothing left of it to pass on.

Now to get insulting. Fact: YOUR PARENTS HAVE PROBABLY DONE MORE TO HELP THE UNDERGROUND SCENE THAT YOU. During the 60's and 70's the scene, although not computer orientated (The Internet just a glimour in the US militarys eye...) activism in all its forms was rampant. Your parents have probably signed petitions, gone on marches, some have probably even been arrested fighting, or protesting for their rights. More so (again) for americans (makes you *almost* think twice about slagging them off all the time doesnt it?). What have YOU done to make a difference? Hording warez, although admirable, doesnt count for all that much, because the hippocrites in the establishment all do it as well. I ask you to ask yourself, what have you done that memorable for your generation? 

Im not suggesting we recreate the past in terms of activism, those days have indeed past. I am suggesting, we begin to do SOMETHING to be remembered by, else we are simply, as a generation, going to be rememberd for crap commercial dance music, alchopops and the rise in street violence. Is that how you want to go down in history? because you will if things do not change. And im not suggesting that everyone should start some kind of revolution, im a realest, all people have their place; but if you are reading this, you ARE in a position to do something, and you have already made steps in the right direction. Now ask yourself one more question; are you the real thing.

Make a difference, or fuck off out of my sight.

Got some static on its pins,
Now I don't see the dust bin,
Mama,

But now I've got to throw it all away
Mama, ooooooh,
Didn't mean to make it fry
If I've no stack to overflow tomorrow,
Carry one, carry one,
'Cause there's nothing like class lib'ries.

Too late,
My time(2) has come
Send lightning down my line
Stop my make() before it's time
Goodbye, everybody,
I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and read Knuth.

Mama, ooooooh, (Anything but Windows(tm))
I don't want to *sigh*

Gone away now,

Comrade - Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a crudely disguised attempt to do my Systems Architecture 2 revision as a soljo article, I present:

===========================================
Comrade's Introduction to Operating Systems
===========================================

An Operating System (OS) is the most fundamental (and complex) piece of software likely to be running on your computer. It is responsible for I/O, Process, Network, and Memory management and interfacing with the hardware thus providing some description of interface for applications to be run upon.
The most (in)famous OS has become the mammoth Windows(tm), in it's alarmingly increasing array of incarnations. Suited for the home user, Microsoft's (I notice that was in my Word dictionary already...) nice little earner has proved an unprecedented success, despite ALL of its shortcomings. None of this is news to you but it's nice to have things put into context. Lovely, in fact, since I suspect |Paris| frowns upon my use of such girlie words.

I've split some the various aspects of the OS into sections, bearing a purely coincidental resemblance to the chapters in my textbook.

Process Management
------------------

Processes represent an allocation of system resources that will do work within their allocation. A process will own one or more threads that enable actual code to be executed by the processor (So be sure to ask for this component when buying a new computer).
Each process (or task) will have a data structure associated with it, maintained by the OS. This task structure will typically contain its owner (user), a process id, program and data addresses, a list of threads and associated file information. 
Threads owned by a process may be recorded by a linked list, so memory for processes may be allocated dynamically and the described task structure may be defined as a fixed size. These threads will have a data structure for themselves, since their process owner, priority and the current register states may be saved. This in necessary since the OS will need to swap threads (and processes) in order to have more than one thread and program 'running' at once, or rather loaded in some type of memory. By rapidly alternating between threads, the OS may create the effect of running more than one program at once, or multi 'tasking' (/processing).
A thread will not always be executing code; it may be waiting for I/O or may have used its entire time slice up. When this occurs, it will enter the 'wait' state and its volatile environment (the processor registers it had access to) will be copied before the copying it to the queue and next state's environment is loaded and begun execution. This is known as context switching.
The allocation of runtime to each thread is determined by scheduling. The OS uses a thread priority (represented numerically) and it's position in the queue to determine the order of execution. Of course scheduling is far more elaborate than this in practice, since multiple queues may be (and are) maintained and priority may have to be determined.
If you're running Windows you can study your systems processes from the task manager dialog box, wonder what all those processes are, and why they've been allocated so much memory. I do.

Memory Management
-----------------

At its lowest level the memory manager is responsible for allocating memory for processes so that they might be able to execute, and manipulate data in different types of memory, including physical storage of course. Typically implemented in both hardware and software, it provides memory protection, sharing, and extension of physical space via virtual memory. By mapping logical to physical addresses (address mapping) the programmer is enabled to access all types of 'memory' available on the bus such as normal RAM, as well as video memory, magnetic storage devices, etc. 
Basic memory protection is provided once a program has been loaded, and its addresses in the executable code mapped to their appropriate space in memory. The address at which the program begins is now known, as is it's total length and these values are stored into base and length registers respectively on the CPU. When a memory access is performed within the program the desired address may be checked against these registers thus prevented accidental, or malicious access (Not that you'd find anything about that in this zine...). 
Since a normal program usually needs to access many different areas of memory, some shared and some protected, allocation of memory is split into segments each with their own base and length values. A logical address may represent this segmentation by using the first part of the address to indicate the desired segment and the rest as the offset within the segment.

| Segment |    Offset     | <- logical address

That was in fact a diagram. The different base addresses and lengths are stored in a table, and here protection bits may be added (r, w, x) to make up these segment descriptors.
Due to the large amount of storage but fast access necessary, memory is split in to different areas like the hard disk, RAM, and the processors own cache (these three dramatically decreasing in size of course, but significantly increasing in access time). The memory manager must use an algorithm (and memory) to determine which segments are to be held in RAM when new data on the disk is required and also keep track of modifications to the accessed data. 
Because segments are of variable length practical memory management of the whole memory would be difficult so fixed length pages are used to store segments and these pages are what's loaded from disk when necessary. A 'miss' on RAM (accessing data not there) is where the term, "page fault" comes from. A segment may of course span over a number of pages, so here's an extended logical address structure including the page:

| Segment | Page | Offset |

I got bored at this point, and I presume you have as well. Still, thickened the issue up a bit didn't it ?

(SmuDger) The Pampers Rant!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lucida Console SmuDgeR here. I've been asked by the powers that(wish to)be to write an article for umm....soljo? think thats it, anyways here goes with no apologies for typos n shit.

Oh before I do a quick plug, this is the sort of garbage you can expect to see @ www.firestar.co.uk in the "rantings" section.....once the sites finished :)

Workmates eh? a funny old breed they are. Most i get on with at my work, I mean, i wouldn't be seen dead with them outside the factory but, yeah i get on with them. sadly though, as with all workplaces, there is always one complete fuckwit and yes my freinds.....i have one working with me :/ this guy is very strange, theres no one on the entire planet like him. he's a bit simple, well one cent short of a dollar.

First up is is language an example would be(and this is a fact no exageration) "hi smudger, I just got the fuckin em...oh wot the fucks it called...yeah the new fuckin hard house 3 album. its fuckin magic theres some fuckin great tunes on the fuckin thing, but it was a fuckin cunt of a thing to get hold of the fuckin shop was always sold out of the bastard things, thank fuck i went in today though coz i fuckin got hold of the last bastard", then hed proceed to laff and laff and laff and laff, thinking this was some sort of fuckin em hilarious story! I mean, what kinda fuckin language is that to use first off and why the fuck is it so funny!!!

The language goes in well with his temper though....he's so easily wound up its side splitting(for us :)) let's say he fucks up on a machine....we go hahahahahahahaha pampers u fuckwit!(as you do in a factory) most would laff and say fuck off then laff again with everyone else....this guy? oh no he takes it a step further with "AHH FOR FUCKS SAKE STUPID FUCKING THING!! "then we laff, "FUCK OFF YOU BUNCH OF FUCKING ARSEHOLES!!!" we laff more, "FUCKING SUDDUP UP!!!!!!", then we go "haha pampers you useless bastard", "FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!". As you can see he can be(and is indeed most times)very VERY loud!

now it gets wierd.

ok i work in a fish factory(smelly dirty job but someone has to supply you lot with it)we proccess herring(aka kippers) and mackrel(aka...umm....mackrel!).

So we got pampers standing there with a fish...whats he  do? open its mouth slips his finger in and...proceeds to poke it quite viciously. but thats not all while he's doing that he will stare at someone with the most disturbing look you will not see outside a high security mental hospital.

Theres more this guy is sexually depraved, an example: one day were all outside, he grabs this guy(who is simple but not fucked up simple like pampers) from behind and, proceeds to 
have simulated sex with him(the poofy kinda sex)looking at his face whilst he's doing this is, well high security mental hospital look again.

another example would be the time two women were talking dirty to him in the store, he got so excited by this conversation he took a fucking hardon!!!!!! and showed it off!!!!!!(still in his trousers of corse but it was visible non the less).

Then theres the fact he's a wanker.....no not a wanker as in fuck you wanker!....no i mean this guy wanks at certain times during the day....he's told us! 5.30am every morning b4 work he wanks!

even when hes having a shit he's had a wank!!

Theres so much more i could say about him like the time he told us he got cought wanking over his dads porno mags wearing headphones, by his mum! but i dont think the powers that be (hey paris....luv u man! uNF! uNF!) would let me so this is SmuDgeR signing off

(PaRiS) Nothing to Loose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only way to change me is baby blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Prey to my God every day but she dont listen
The hipocracy bothers me, just take a listen
And you can hear me crying, praying for anwers and that I'll be dead soon
And my life, I wish I was somewhere else, but I can't denie myself
Can I blame them cos they made me, wish they woulda told me,
That Im too much like them, so no one can love me now
Got involved at an early age, got my shit down so I'd never be affraid
But then I went astray, casting shit, doing wrong, getting laid
Cant turn back, my eyes on the prize, I go nothing to loose,
Everybody gotta die, say goodbye to the mad guy, 
That you fucked with and then passed by,
Do or die walk a mile in my she's you'd me crazy too
With nothing to loose.

I thank the lore for my many blessings, though im stressing
Keep a shadow for protection from that battle of Hell n Heaven
And all my friends in sin, here we go again,
And nothing seperate us but the black then?
Born at the bottom as a hustler, OG, stright soldier,
And they all wanna bust this,
But no matter how they try, I retaliate, dont care if I live or die,
See me walking down the ally on my own now
And when I die ther'll be no one to cry foul
And let the dark turn the lights on, chase me mother fucker, now,
I got nothing to loose.
Im now the realest mother fucker you ever damn saw, living raw, and
Till they bury me dont worry me; Im high 
Living like I aint affraid to die, and I'll tell you,
Walk a mile in my shoe's and you'd be crazy too.
With nothing to loose. 

Aint no escape from a deadly fate, 
And every day there's a million souls go that way
Ive half a mind to loose hope, seems every one's on dope
And they tell me to leave cos Im broke,
Almost makes me wanna choke
Alone on my own Im still waiting here
Yeah all alone with my fear
And I got nothing to loose,
So I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real g?
I forgive you if ya feel me...
Cos all my life Ive been dirt broke, little skinny mother fucker on dope
I could end it with a razor blade,
But every day is a struggle, i just went got laid, 
Walk a mile in my shoes and you'd be crazy too
With nothing to loose.

<PaRiS> Anon Internet on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you serf around the internet are you happy with the fact that you every movement is being tracked by your ISP? And more worryingly whoever 0wns and or "Runs" your ISP? Are you happy with the fact that there is a distinct possiblity that ALL your internet communications in the UK go through GCHQ (General Comuinications Head Quarters). They see all the goat pron you view, all the warez you download, you only lucky that the whole world and his mother download more propz than you else you would be busted in less time that it takes for a nuns first curry to see the ubend. The only thing between you a bustation is wieght of numbers. Feeling uncomfatable yet?So what can you do about this? Well... it depends on exactly what you use the internet for in the first place. For each service you use, you have to think in terms of connecting through somewhere to use it. Thats the bottom line. The classic example of this are IRC bounce accounts on EZ Bounce or BNC which work like this: You connect to "Elite.bnc.org" from you ISP and then connect OUT from "Elite.Bnc.Org" with their IP and host. Meaning that anyone who /whois's, /dns's or does anyform of trace on you from IRC will only ever get the result Elite.bnc.org. This effectively makes it impossible to tell where you are actually connecting from, its not fool proof; anyone really trying to trace you such as a government agency could go through the logs of the BNC provider to check you log in time relative to your ISP log in time etc. But basically, for day to day use; its effective, and it provides some degree of anomity.The same principle can be used with any internet service. You can "Proxy" via another provider, or better still; find a shell (UNIX account) provider (Who dont log) and who provide ALL proxying services, effectively meaning you dialup to your ISP, but all your out going internet communications (and even most easily traced incoming...) go through your chosen shell. Failing that, there are many ways to be anonymous for free on the internet, read on.HTTP anomity is perhaps the easiest to set up; although how secure some alegedly secure servers are is questionable, they still cut off a simple ISP spying on you but moving you out of their field of vision (So to speak). A good place to get a relatively up to date list of HTTP proxy servers is here:http://netspy.ukrpack.net/To set this up is really easy, just go into your ie or netscape connections settings and select "Connect via proxy server or lan" and input the server ip/host and port of the proxy server you have chosen from the above site. After that, any request made from your browser (ie to look at www.goatsex.cx) will first go through the proxy, and thus appear as if it originated there. Meaning your ISP dont know your looking at it, and nor do the admins of said goatsex.cx. Easy.The same goes for FTP. TELnet proxy servers (Notabley wingate's) can also be found but you are much much better off getting hold of a shell from somewhere and using that, perhaps using a few free shells to spider you way around the internet using the simple TELNET <host> command in any $Bash account. ie... telnet into m-net.arbornet.org and follow the commands to set up a free account and then run unix command, the command being the afore mentioned TELNET <host>. Any request made from here will show m-net's IP and not yours. Easy. Email can also be used via a shell, meaning a) you cant get virii from your mail because its never actually on your computer and b) it cannot easily be traced to you, esp if you spider to it using multiple shell accounts. Yes Im paranoid, but so should you be.

Llama - The problems with the occult.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	I have a problem with the occult, witchcraft, and especially the idea of magic. You see, I have always been quite sceptical about these sorts of things. Now in a fantasy reality sort of way, e.g. Lord of the Rings, Warhammer, I have no problem with it. It adds a sort of.... extra dimention to the stories and games, and makes then a bit more exciting. However, in real life, I just cannot see these things working. I`ll explain.
	Now, I`ll take a look at this in a scientific sort of way. Everything in the universe needs energy for it to work. Right?. Okay. Now take a look at spellcasting. This would need energy to perform whatever. Think of a spell. Familiars? The creation of something out of nothing (well, more than oxygen, nitrogen and some noble gases). Pull the other one. A spell which affects the outcome of the future? er, well, that would quite frankly be impossible. Ability to look into the future? hahah. I don`t think the planets exert that much gravity to have an effect (gravity affects time, if you don`t know). It would also mean that your future has already been predetermined. What an awful thing! You would have no control over your own destiny.  Having an effect on somebodies mind? A mystical energy (lets call it ooh, magicon. Yeah!) affects the brain pathways, disrupting the electrical signals passing between the nerve cells. But how could you direct it? that would be the most amazing thing of all. I mean, the brain is an amazing organ, but that powerful? no.
	Here is another point: If witchcraft and spells, or psychic powers really did exist, why are we not all doing them today? After all, these are fantastic things, being able to heal with a touch, or move objects without touching them, how about influencing another persons mind? Clearly, if we could, we would.
	Now, I`m going to keep this short. Naturally, I`m going to get a bit of uh, stick from some people, who clearly feel that all of these things exist. Well, I say prove it. Bring on the evil death spells, eh? ;) I`ll see how I can attempt to debunk it. If I can`t, well, I`m a believer.

	Looking forward to a predetermined summer of misery now, Llama

Shit of the Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Reflection over the last few months of what was hot, what was not, who was lame and
who was kool; not to mention who we miss, who we dont and all the other random
irrelivent stuff has played a part.


-----------------------------------


Lam3rz of the Issue: Deviate (IRCop on irc.starchat.net: Anal retentive, Trax adds: "Cheeky cow", who should know better.), rlang@clara.net <--- Hippy Twat "Email the President TODAY!" yeah yeah, go get a clue... Anyone who suggests we do Soljo as HTML, We feel you are missing the point. Anyone who thinks DOS'ing a 56kbps Modem of line is in anyway kool. Your just a fucking packet monkey with nothing better to do.
                     

Kool Shit of the Issue: Eskimo Bob. He rocks. Everyone on Moo, for the continuing support for writing this issue (AKA WHERE IS SOLJO!!!!).
