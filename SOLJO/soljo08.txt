~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jesus H Christ I have a headache. Thats the last time I ever let Chicken Soup convince me that an impromptue Tequila night is in order. Right, yes. The new issue is here?!?! At long fucking last I hear you all say! Yea well... I never "Promised to keep dis shit regular" But this is prolly the best example of SOL disorganisation to come up with wikked results, this issue is the pha77 shit - That IS a promise.

Just a few notes Ive dumped in the Editorial slot (I do that, because I have a memory like a..... I forget) SOL and Politics; you may have noticed a distinctly left wing feel to SOL as of late. Yea, well... What do you expect? Comrade was bound to get his claws into us sooner or l8r. Thats the thing about socialism; its catching. So yeah, if you wanna call us left wing, I suppose you can, just dont get too used to it. Buy a copy of socialist worker. (If anything will convince you to join the Tory party its that piece of tat).

On a more personal level, the birds from the "Channel 4 program Bits" never replied to my second email; so they can all take turns blowing me. All I asked was "Interview? Yay or nay". There was no need to ignore me. If I was anything other than "Mr Lethargic" I would be upset.

Well Ive nothing else to say other than The Anti Newbie Hitsquad on xnet have my full support. Checking out, checking in. I may never actually begin.

<Chucuri> Bad Road Conditions and Miraculous Fishing - a history of the ELN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
On April 12 1999 at 10:30 local time, a twin engine Fokker 50 aeroplane of the Colombian national airline Avianca took off from the city of Bucaramanga in Santander department. Among the 41 passengers were included a Congressman of the ruling Conservative Party and the head of the state-owned natural gas company ECOGAS.

The passengers were settling in to what would be a short flight to Bogotá and looking forward to refreshments. No doubt they had chosen this method of travel not just to avoid the long drive, but to avoid "bad road conditions."
 
Bad road conditions??? 
 
(Scene: the home of a wealthy family in Bogotá. Señor Montoya is sitting outside at a table under the shade of a leafy tree and orders the maid to make coffee for himself and his wife. Meanwhile, in the background another servant is busy scrubbing the swimming pool next to them to keep it gleaming blue in the bright sunshine.)
 
Señor Montoya: What do you think about spending the weekend at the beach in Cartagena?
Señora Montoya: I don't know dear, Radio Caracol said the road conditions are bad.
Señor Montoya: Well we had better not risk it then.
 
What could this mysterious phenomenon be? The Montoyas are talking of something worse than black ice on a steep street, or even - horror of horrors- a contraflow on the M5 specially timed to coincide with a bank holiday. Surely not!
 
Meanwhile, the sun has just risen in the jungle covered hills somewhere in Antioquía department. A squad of 30 guerrillas of the Carlos Alirio Buitrago Front of the National Liberation Army has completed the night's march from their base camp and are standing on a ridge overlooking a winding section of the Bogotá-Medellín highway. They are wearing camouflage uniforms and the red and black flag of their organisation as a bandanna to cover their faces, leaving just a small gap under the peaks of their green caps through which to see. Their commander gives the order to descend the slope and position themselves amongst the trees by the side of the road.
A few minutes later, a car is seen approaching in the distance. Several combatants step out into the road, one holds his hand up indicating to the driver to halt while others wave their rifles in the air. The driver clearly sees they are not looking for an opportunity to wash his windscreen and slows to a stop.
One guerrillero goes up to the car and the driver winds the window down nervously. He asks to see the identification that all citizens must carry, and the driver hands it over. Meanwhile, other Elenos search the boot and back seat, but they find nothing of interest, and anyway the car is rather old and shabby, obviously the driver isn't made of money.
 
But while this has been going on, more vehicles have been building up behind. This is a roadblock. About 10 cars, a lorry and a coach have stopped. The guerrillas carry out the same procedure on these. In one they find an off duty policeman and they order him to get out of the car while the occupants of one or two luxury automobiles are also ordered out.
 
The lorry belongs to the Porce-2 Consortium and is transporting cement, yes the grey power used in concrete. The squad commander takes out his laptop from a backpack and soon finds the data that his unit, the Carlos Alirio Buitrago Front of the National Liberation Army has collected on various companies and their tax payments. Scrolling down the list, there is Porce-2, and no, they haven't paid their tax. The wonders of modern technology, even out in the foothills of the Andes...
 
So he tells three rebels and they go and order the driver out of his lorry, before one Eleno removes a cigarette lighter from his pocket and sets fire to the upholstery of the cab. Soon it has caught and is going merrily.
 
With the bus, two men and a woman board the vehicle to check the passengers ID. Here too, there is nothing of interest but the occupant are clearly humble people. Some are from the city but others are obviously peasants, carrying chickens with their legs bound and bags of vegetables. So they detect a suitable audience and the guerrillera begins to hand out leaflets about the ELN to those present before telling them why the guerrilla fighter fights. This seems to strike a chord and the passengers gradually become less nervous of the Elenos' threatening appearance in their midst. Outside, black smoke is billowing from the lorry by now.
 
By about mid day many more vehicles have been stopped and searched, over a hundred in all. But then the sound of an approaching helicopter comes to their attention and the guerrillas gather together with six of the more affluent passengers and the policeman they had detained. Should they open fire on the army aircraft? Their AK and Galil rifles are hardly ideal anti-aircraft weapons but still, the Simon Bolívar Company of the ELN had shot down a Vietnam War era police helicopter flying over South Bolívar. But no, their commander gives the order to move on and soon they have disappeared back into the trees with their detainees, leaving behind a burnt out lorry and several abandoned cars blocking the highway.
 
This has become known as MIRACULOUS FISHING, the analogy being that the passing 'fish' are caught in the 'net' the guerrillas have set on the highway.
 
Several days later, the relatives receive a letter demanding a bank statement. If the contents are found to be satisfactory, it is followed by a request for about $250 000 for the person to be released.
 
Running into bad road conditions is costly.
 
But meanwhile, over three thousand metres up in the atmosphere, the Avianca passengers are far away from such concerns as miraculous fishing and bad road conditions and are occupied by different thoughts as the green landscape and its potential pitfalls slide safely away below.
The ECOGAS executive is thinking about how many millions of cubic feet of gas a newly discovered field will yield, while the Congressman is occupied by preparing a speech. A few seats away a nun is thinking of God, or at least that is what she should be.
 
Then suddenly five passengers jump up out of their seats, they look like businessmen but four pull out pistols while another produces a hand grenade. Three run to the cockpit where they order the pilot "Take us to Simití!!" "This plane is commandeered by the ELN!" the others tell the startled passengers.
 
The nun twitches noticeably and then hurriedly performs the sign of the cross.
 
"Where is Simití, I have never flown there. There is no airport at Simití" a shocked and worried pilot says.
 
"Just do what we tell you to!"
 
"But.."
 
"Just fly west and Simití is there. Next to the River Magdalena. There is an airstrip, it is grass, but it will do."
 
"Er..Grass? The tyres won't stand it, they will burst. This plane was built to land on a proper..."
 
"You are a prisoner of the ELN! No arguing!!" and reminds the pilot of the gun.
 
Less than half an hour later, the wide muddy brown ribbon of the River Magdalena appears in the view below as it follows its sluggish course between thick forest on either bank. However there is no sign of any airstrip.
They order the pilot to follow the west bank northwards while scanning the ground below but after a while there is still no sign. The pilot notices the fuel gauge indicating less than twenty minutes of fuel left. Any worries he keeps to himself and is ordered to turn round and scan back in a southerly direction. Yes, just in time, the rough pale green of an airstrip cut into the darker green forest.
 
They circle round and descend. As it approaches, the ground looks very bumpy, in fact there appear to be small craters in the grassy strip. Clearly not up to the standard of the runway at Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport, the intended destination.
 
But, as with the fuel the pilot has to keep this to himself. And yes, the landing was as bumpy as expected, as it bounced along the ground the Fokker 50 burst a tyre as it struck a hollow before juddering to a halt.
 
What on earth are they doing here? The pilot, crew and passengers think. "Take us to Cuba!" or "Take us to Lebanon!" might have been familiar at one time in international flights, but a domestic flight hijacked to this remote airstrip near the village of Simití?
 
Too soon however, a welcoming party of several hundred from the Héroes de Santa Rosa Front had gathered round the plane. Perhaps not the welcome the passengers had hoped for.
 
The Héroes de Santa Rosa Front orders both the crew of 5 and the 41 passengers off the plane before shooting out the surviving tyres for good measure. (They make a satisfying sound as they burst and the plane settles slightly) Then they split the crowd up into several groups and shepherded them down to the river where a small fleet of canoes wait to take them away.
 
Meanwhile, panic is setting in at Bucaramanga as the Avianca flight mysteriously lost contact with the control tower, wandered off its intended flight path and then disappeared from the radar screen. Had it crashed? Guerrillas had never hijacked a plane before in the entire previous 35 years of their struggle and this reason did not enter the minds of anyone at the airport.

A search and rescue helicopter is dispatched to scour the area the Fokker 50 disappeared in. The pilot comes back with news that the plane is sitting on an illegal airstrip surrounded by people in jungle camouflage.
 
Over the next few days, several elderly passengers are released as well as some for medical reasons to Red Cross officials by the Héroes de Santa Rosa Front. After all, the guerrillas stick rigidly to the principle of continuous movement to avoid the enemy, with marches through the day and night from one camp to another.
 
Others, younger, fitter or more wealthy are released in dribs and drabs over the following months, after paying juicy sums of dolares. Now [August 2000] over a year later, four of the detainees are still held. No doubt they have walked thousands of kilometres through the forests, mountains and swamps of Colombia's Magdalena Medio region by now. Well I think the exercise should do them good.
 
 
        BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ELN 


        1964: the Evil Emperor of the World (also 
        
        known as President Lyndon Johnson) has
 
        proclaimed death to any movement that challenges 
  
        the authority of the Empire.
 
        He sends out his Emperor's Champions (the CIA)
 
        to eliminate those who challenge this unfair 
 
        and greedy judgement. Many of the people's greatest
 
        heroes will die; Che Guevara is killed in Bolivia 
 
        and Patrice Lumumba in Congo.
 
        Over Vietnam the Emperor has already ordered Carpet bombing.
 
 
        In Colombia the people have lost their hero Jorge Elicier, 
       
        and without him to give them hope, the peasants have 
 
        become unruly, bands of army death squads stalk the land, 
 
        massacres and murder are common place; La Violencia has come.
 
        But, in all this chaos, there still may be, one...


                 Last Hero in Santander.
 
[Que "Merengue Style" Music. Some kind of, possibly small rural village. NICOLÁS RODRÍGUEZ BAUTISTA stands, with a home-made backpack and a FAL rifle. Everything is spoken in Spanish, but there don't seem to be any subtitles. The Music ends.]
 
Nicolás looks rather small, in fact he is 13.
 
Fortunately, there are sixteen others and they are older.
 
[On Que he walks out of the village and its improbably "light weight" houses of palm fronds, into the forest. At one of the doorways his mother and 17 brothers and sisters are waving and he is holding a flag that she has spent most of last night making from scraps of fabric, the top half is red and the bottom black with the large white letters "ELN" across the middle. He is followed by LUIS JOSÉ SOLANO SEPÚLVEDA, MANUEL VÁSQUEZ CASTAÑO his brother ANTONIO VÁSQUEZ CASTAÑO and the others.]
 
This is their first march, and it lasts from today, 4 July 1964 till January 7 1965 (they do stop for a rest from time to time). 
 
On this date their revolutionary movement bursts onto the scene as they seize the village of Simacota, overrun the local police and proclaim the Manifesto of Simacota to the peasants. They call themselves Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) or National Liberation Army.
 
The Evil Emperor's Viceroy in Bogotá declares a State of Emergency across the land and orders the Emperor's Champions to track down the rebel band. 
 
Troops pour into Santander department, but the forests and mountains provide good cover and the helpful peasants of the zone give shelter and food. They tell the rebels when the army is coming too. The Empire proclaims death to anyone sheltering or aiding a guerrilla band.
 
Still, the ELN escapes and volunteers flock to it from the countryside and cities. By 1973 it numbers about 300.
 
However this has not escaped the attention of the Empire, and at Anorí in Antioquía it has prepared a deadly trap (in the years since 1964 the ELN has abandoned Santander and transferred itself west across the River Magdalena to this department) 30 000 of the best soldiers surround it here and in the fighting Commander Manuel Vásquez Castaño, Antonio Vásquez Castaño and many others die and the guerrilla is decimated. This is "Anorí, the heroism of sacrifice without limits."
 
"NOT ONE STEP BACK... LIBERATION OR DEATH!"
 
But the ELN is not extinguished and under this slogan it regroups. Still the crisis continues, by 1978 the organisation is reduced to fewer than 40 guerrillas in two groups separated by many weeks march through the mountains and its urban support network has collapsed, in these years the ELN disappears from public view and many believe it no longer exists.
 
They are wrong! The 80s prove to be a better decade. The Elenos (members of the ELN are known as "Elenos" unless they are female when they are "Elenas") grow in number and new units (or Fronts) are formed and spread out across the country. Numbering 4 Fronts at the beginning of the decade it reaches 30 by 1990.
And they are closing in on the cities as well, in 1986 the ELN begins "El Coveñazo" as it bombs oil refineries in the capital Bogotá and other cities. In 1988 they execute the Bishop of Arauca after a Popular Trial (he was on the side of the Empire) and the Pope promptly excommunicates them, although this does not seem to trouble them too much. In this year the ELN invades the airwaves with Radio Patria Libre and despite attempts to bust it (the air force drops 250 pound bombs on the camp) it escapes.
 
In these years they become the thorn in the side of greedy companies that are flocking to the land in search of oil. But this has a good side as well, as they provide a source of income from "taxation" and kidnapping. Since 1985, they bomb the OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM Corp.'s Caño Limón-Coveñas export pipeline more than 500 times, causing over $1.5 billion in damage. 
 
Then in 1998, Commander Manuel Perez Martinez dies from Hepatitis and is replaced by Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista as leader of the ELN. (He is the only surviving one of the 17 who took to the hills back in 1964.)
 
These days the ELN numbers 65 Fronts (these by the way are named after Eleno heroes who have died in the struggle over the years, José Luis Solano Sepúlveda for example is immortalised by the José Luis Solano Sepúlveda Front that operates in the south of Bolívar department) and around eight thousand combatants.
 
And the war against the Empire goes on. Now the Evil Emperor has suddenly discovered that Colombia is the source of most of the world's cocaine and more and more heroine (the peasants are growing coca and poppies to survive because of poverty) and under a smokescreen of drugs (this is something he would know about, although he says he didn't inhale) the Emperor's Champions are deployed again to do away with the troublesome rebellion. This time they come with Black Hawk attack helicopters and night vision equipment.
 
The ELN responds with a two week National Armed Strike, plunging Colombia into chaos as they dynamite electricity pylons, substations, oil pipelines, telecommunications installations, banks, automatic cash machines, the Medellín Metro, set up roadblocks on important highways and demolish the bridges, set fire to vehicles that defy the strike and kidnap dozens of people. In Bogotá traffic lights fail, lifts stop, and trading screens at the stock exchange flicker before going out as the power fails.
 
Who will win? Who knows. What we do know is that the Elenos are not going to give up now after 36 years, and we know which side we are on...

<fwaggle> Making NTFS Volumes > 2GB...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Surely many of you must have noticed that when you install NT4 on a disk larger than 2gb, you can only create partitions that are 2gb or smaller in size during the install. Many of you may also know that this is because NT's installer creates FAT partitions, then converts them to NTFS.

A reccommended way to get around this is to partition and format the drive on another NT machine, directly as NTFS. Then install on the first machine as normal. Or you can split and have a 2gb boot partition and the rest for data.

Both these methods are royal pains in the proverbial. There is a way to format it as 2gb during your install, and then have a single large drive as an end result. It's called Volume Sets, and it's done with the Windows NT Disk Administrator.

During the install, format the first 2gb of the disk as NTFS, then install normally. Then after the install, run Disk Administrator. Select the 2GB partition, then hold control and select the remaining free space. Select "Extend Volume Set..". Enter the size you want for your Volume, or use the default to use the maximum ammount of space.

You will need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect, and dont panic if NT halts at the loader stage to check the volume. It's completely normal, and takes a little while but it shouldn't find any faults.

I'm not sure if there are any technical reasons why this method wouldn't be preferable, but you might want to consider doing some homework before you put any important information on this volume. I have been using it without problems though.

Everyone knows that the first "P" in PGP doesn't stand for perfect. But the encryption algorythm used by PGP was generally thought to thwart all but the most sophisticated threats to privacy. Network Associates confirmed Thursday that PGP is in fact breakable by someone with the right technical knowledge. A fix will be available soon. - HNN.

CERT released a statement last Friday warning the public that hundreds of computers had been compromised and are poised for a massive Internet attack. Kevin Poule, CERT Incident Response Team Leader, is urging SAs to install Unix patches in an effort to protect systems from what is believed to be the formation of a large-scale DoS attack. CERT thinks there are several groups working separately to develop and execute an attack of this magnitude and the best remedy is to update and increase security measures. - HNN.

[Man we have to get into phone phreaking]
If you have a GSM phone, a local attacker can setup a rogue cell tower tricking your phone into thinking that it is in a foreign country that doesn't support encryption (doh!). Your phone then goes on and does it's business in the clear. Typical vendor response; 'we know about it, but haven't seen it demonstrated'.. 'requires considerable technical skill.. blah blah blah, will fix in the next GSM version'. - HNN.

[At last .edu's make a stand]
It appears file sharing won't be banned at some of the nation's top universities. The bold move warrants a round of kudos to the sanity displayed by these institutions of higher learning. Just imagine the potential consequences of removing Napster access. What would be next? No more ftp, nfs, or Windows networking? Next thing you know, VCRs and photocopiers would disappear from the libraries and one could only begin to fathom the fall out from that.

<Comrade> Ancient Computers #1 - The 48k Spectrum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was the early eighties.....well screw the history lesson; I was born and the ZX Spectrum+ was released is more than you need to know for now. Following the notoriously unreliable Z80 came the almost as bad ZX Spectrum. Proof of uncle Clive's unhealthy obsession with letters toward the end of the alphabet, this rounded, rubber keyed little black box was the beginning of home computer gaming. Probably. Was for me anyway, although I allready had an Atari 2600 (don't ask, kids. No-one could beat my high-score in Centipede) and I only had a ZX Spectrum+ (plus). The + model had plastic keys and was more boxy with nasty sharp edges. It wasn't as structurally sound either; mine has begun degrading as such having had a chunk knocked off it near the dc input.
Now this was going to take some getting used to. Not carts, but cassette tapes held the software*. You had to wait now, and indeed listen with the 48k. The kind of sounds we would typically associate with a dial-up modem today were similar to those one was forced to hear blaring from the 48k's internal speaker (about the same quality as a pc internal speaker. No to be fair, it was a bit better. Incredible they still put those in new pcs today) There is a reason for this. Sort of. Typically, more than one program would be stored on the same tape so if you didn't want to sit through loading a load (ahaha. ahem.) of other programs you would have to search around for the one you wanted. I didn't have some fancy tape player that could search for blank spaces in the tape (nor did anyone else), so finding the right program can be regarded something of a skill. Covertapes (yes. none of your fancy cd/dvd rubbish on magazines) mounted on magazines such as crash, sinclair user, and the almost legendary Your Sinclair (sort of carried on with amiga power) tended to use a different loader to normal software. Porbably a kind of compression, but the point is it was absurdly unreliable. A small inperfection in the tape (well I have nothing else to blame it one apart from the spectrum itself. Which is probably just a guilty) meant your luvely game won't werk. Maybe never, maybe only sometimes. It's probably possible to load another game without re-loading the loader (this is my name for whatever it is) if one failed, and there are plenty of other such tricks. The loading was grapically represented within what was called a border (rather a large one) by lots of rapily moving horizontal lines of two colors. If one of these colours were to change (purple and black to red and purple is a good example) loading with a cheap covertape, you were screwed - the game wouldn't load correctly. Interesting rituals may be performed in an attempt to prevent this phenomenon from occuring. Rom images and similar under emulators cut out all of this once necessary wait, unless you build a tape inteface via the parallel port or similar. (It is possible - I did it with my amiga, and the loading is equally unreliable!)
The +2 and +3 models with their many refinements including 128k deserve a lengthly analysis but since I went straight to the commodore 64 I can't really do one. (I was offered a +3, with disk drive et all (gasp) but I declined for some reason) If you had one and are as foolishly nostailgic as me, you should write something. The ed might thank you.

*I have ignored microdrive carts. (mentioned in the ZX Spectrum+ user guide. But since the one pictured was for 'Horace and the Spiders', you'll take my word for it when I say it's probably just as well.)

A short list of unknown spectrum games that are great
=====================================================

Ninja Hampster (Your Sinclair covertape)
Tour de Force (Crash covertape. I only had about 6. Luckily I had the one with this on it. Watch the opponent on the American level. buahaha.)
How to be a complete bastard (Your sinclair covertape. I'm not making that up. You can find it on emulation sites. Awesome)
Dizzy 1 thru 6 (Commercial. Not so unknown, but these days Resident Evil is supposed to be a classic. ahahah. This is what you want to be playing, KlaiRe. Not something nasty like Doom)
Butch Hard Guy (Crash covertape. Well, it was crap really but the author had a sense of humour. There were 5 control methods [keyboard, joysticks..] number 5: "Look, no hands! Vegan mind control". I have as yet been unable to use it. Probably that omlette.)

Sinclair ZX Spectrum+ and ZX Microdrive are Trade Marks of Sinclair Research Limited

You're all wet you silly girl.

<MSNBC Research> A Brief History of Hacking...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Early 1960s
University facilities with huge mainframe computers, like MIT's artificial intelligence lab, become staging grounds for hackers. At first, "hacker" is a positive term that describes a person with a mastery of computers who can push programs beyond what they were designed to do.  

 1983
In one of the first arrests of hackers, the FBI busts six teen-age hackers from Milwaukee, known as the "414s" after the local area code. The hackers are accused of some 60 computer break-ins, including from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to Los Alamos National Laboratory. One of the hackers gets immunity for his testimony; the other five get probation.  

 1984
Eric Corley, who uses the hacking handle "Emmanuel Goldstein," starts 2600: The Hacker Quarterly in New York, which quickly becomes a clearinghouse for hacking information.  

 1985
Underground journalists "Taran King" and "Knight Lightning" launch Phrack, an electronic magazine based in St. Louis that provides information about computer hacking.  

 1987
A 17-year-old high school dropout named Herbert Zinn, known to authorities as Shadow Hawk, admits he broke into AT&T computers at Bedminster, N.J. Federal authorities say the teen  who worked from a computer in the bedroom of his suburban Chicago home  was close to tapping into AT&T's internal operations and the company's central switching system. Zinn, becomes one of the first people prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, which among other things makes it illegal to use another person's password. He is caught after bragging on an electronic bulletin board that he had attacked an AT&T computer.  

 1988
Cornell University graduate student Robert Morris, 22, launches a worm program onto the Internet that he wrote to exploit security holes on UNIX systems. The worm, programmed to penetrate other computers on the network and replicate itself, quickly spreads to more than 6,000 systems  approximately 1/10 of the Internet at the time  and virtually shuts down the network by hogging system resources. Morris, who is arrested soon afterward, says he didn't intend to cause the $15 million to $100 million in damage that experts say his creation wrought. He faces a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines but receives three years of probation, 400 hours of community service and a $10,000 fine.  

 1988
The Department of Defense severs the links between the unclassified Military Network, or Milnet, and the Arpanet  the early Internet  after it is discovered that a hacker has broken into at least one Milnet computer.  

 1989
Five West German cyberspies are arrested on espionage charges as a result of detective work by Clifford Stoll, a University of California, Berkeley, systems administrator who detected and investigated their systematic intrusions into U.S. government and university computer systems. Three of the hackers, who were charged with selling the information and software they obtained to the Soviet KGB, were convicted and sentenced to prison terms, but none ever spent any time behind bars. Stoll later wrote the bestseller "The Cuckoo's Egg" about his pursuit of the hackers.  

 1989
Kevin Mitnick is convicted of stealing software from DEC and long-distance codes from MCI, becoming the first person convicted under a new law against gaining access to an interstate computer network for criminal purposes. He serves a one-year prison term and upon his release on probation is ordered not to use computers or associate with other hackers.  

 1990
Four members of the Legion of Doom, a band of Southern hackers, are arrested for stealing the technical specifications for BellSouth's 911 emergency telephone network, information that could be used to "potentially disrupt or halt 911 service in the United States," according to a subsequent indictment. The company says the hackers also have lifted log-ins, passwords and connect addresses for its computer network and says it has spent $3 million on increased security to combat the hackers. Three of the hackers are found guilty and handed sentences of ranging from 14 months to 21 months and ordered to pay restitution of $233,000 to BellSouth.  

 1990
The Secret Service launches Operation Sundevil to hunt down hackers. Agents eventually seize computer equipment in 14 cities.  

 1991
Police arrest Justin Tanner Petersen in Dallas for possession of a stolen car and find computer files that lead to charges that he broke into the TRW computer system. After his conviction, Petersen is approached by the FBI and the Secret Service to assist in computer investigations. He reportedly helps investigators with the Mitnick case, but in October 1993 he disappears and a short time later is declared a fugitive. He resurfaces in 1994, as a confederate of Kevin Poulsen in his radio-station contest-rigging scheme. (See 1993.)  

 1991
The General Accounting Office reveals that Dutch teen-agers gained access to Defense Department computers during the Persian Gulf War, changing or copying unclassified sensitive information related to war operations, including data on military personnel, the amount of military equipment being moved to the gulf and the development of important weapons systems.  

 1992
Five members of Masters of Deception, a band of teen-agers based in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, are indicted for breaking into the computer systems of AT&T, Bank of America, TRW, and the National Security Agency, among others. Investigators used the first wiretaps ever in a hacker case to apprehend the hackers. One, Mark ("Phiber Optik") Abene, receives a one-year sentence; the others get off with 6-month sentences.  

 1993
Kevin Poulsen is charged with using computers to rig promotional contests at three Los Angeles radio stations, in a scheme that allegedly netted two Porsches, $20,000 in cash and at least two trips to Hawaii. Poulsen, already a fugitive facing federal telecommunications and computer charges, is accused of conspiring with two other hackers, Ronald Mark Austin and Justin Tanner Peterson, to seize control of incoming phone lines at the radio stations. By making sure that only their calls got through, they were able to "win" the top prize.  

 1994
Two hackers identified as "Data Stream" and "Kuji" break into Griffith Air Force base and hundreds of other systems, including computers at NASA and the Korean Atomic Research Institute. After a cyber-manhunt, Scotland Yard detectives arrest "Data Stream," a 16-year-old British teen-ager who curls up in the fetal position and cries when seized. "Kuji" is never found.  

 1994
The Independent newspaper reports that a temporary worker at British Telecom used easily obtained passwords to find the secret phone numbers of the queen, Prime Minister John Major and several top-secret M15 installations, all of which were then posted on the Internet. Steve Fleming, the reporter who wrote the story, later admits that he had worked for the phone company and purloined the numbers.  
 
 1994
Hackers launch full-bore attack on security expert Tsutomu Shimomura's computer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, which stores sophisticated computer security software. Shimomura joins effort to track convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick, who is suspected in the break-in.  

 1995
Kevin Mitnick is arrested in Raleigh, N.C. Physicist and computer security expert Tsutomu Shimomura assists federal authorities in tracking Mitnick down after Mitnick allegedly invaded Shimomura's computer during an assault on San Diego Supercomputer Center systems. Mitnick is charged with breaking into a string of computer networks and stealing 20,000 credit card numbers and copying software programs. Mitnick was in prison awaiting trial until March 1999, when he pleaded guilty to seven felonies. He served another 10 months and was realeased in January 2000 on parole. He cannot use computer equipment until 2003 without permission from his probation officer.  

 1995
Russian hacker Vladimir Levin, 30, is arrested in Britain on charges he used his laptop computer to illegally transfer at least $3.7 million from New York's Citibank to accounts around the world controlled by him and his accomplices. Levin is later extradited to the United States, where he is sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay Citibank $240,000 in restitution.  
 
1995
Satan, a software program designed to find the weaknesses of Unix computers connected to the Internet, is released. Its authors, including security expert Dan Farmer, say they wrote Satan to help operators of computers linked together on network systems to find and fix the flaws in their own systems before the weaknesses are ferreted out by pranksters or hackers.  

 1996
A hacker who goes by the handle Johnny [Xchaotic] mail bombs about 40 politicians, business leaders and other individuals and institutions by subscribing them to Internet mailing lists, generating as many as 20,000 messages in one weekend. [Xchaotic] also publishes a manifesto explaining why he selected each target. He is never caught.  
 
 1997
The InterNIC domain registry operated by Network Solutions is hacked by a business rival. Eugene Kashpureff, operator of AlterNIC, eventually pleads guilty to designing a corrupted version of InterNIC's software that quickly spread around the world to other DNS servers and prevented tens of thousands of Internet users from being able to reach many Web sites in many ".com" and ".net" domains. The software also "hijacked" visitors to InterNIC's Web site, rerouting them to the AlterNIC home page.  
 
 1998
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre announces that hackers have carried out "the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon has seen to date," breaking into the unclassified computer networks of numerous government agencies to examine and possibly alter payroll and personnel data. Shortly afterward, two teen-agers from Cloverdale, Calif., are detained in connection with the break-ins. Three weeks later, authorities announce the arrest of an Israeli teen-ager known as "the Analyzer," the alleged mastermind of the intrusion.  

 1998
Sending a warning to young computer hackers, federal prosecutors for the first time charge a juvenile on hacking charges for shutting down an airport communications system in Worcester, Mass., during an intrusion into Bell Atlantic's computer system a year earlier. The boy's attack interrupted communication between the control tower and aircraft at Worcester Airport for six hours, authorities said. No accidents occurred. Under a plea agreement, the boy, whose name and exact age were not released, pleads guilty and is sentenced to two years probation, ordered to repay the phone company $5,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service.  

 1998
Hackers who say they are members of a group known as Masters of Downloading claim to have broken into a Pentagon network and stolen classified software that allows them to control a military satellite system. They threaten to sell the software to terrorists. The Pentagon later denies that that the software is classified or would allow the hackers to control its satellites, but acknowledge that a less-secure network containing sensitive information had been compromised.  

 May-June 1999
The U.S. Senate, White House and U.S. Army Web sites, along with dozens of other government and consumer sites, fall victim to cyber vandals. In each case, the hackers scrawl messages that are quickly erased. The most notable message reads "Crystal, I love you" on the U.S. Information Agency's Web site, signed "Zyklon".  

 November 1999
Norwegian group Masters of Reverse Engineering (MoRE) cracks a key to decoding DVD copy protection. The group creates a DVD decoder program for distribution on the Web, a move that spurs a flurry of lawsuits from the entertainment industry.  

 February 2000
In a three-day period, hackers brought down leading Web sites including Yahoo!, Amazon.com, Buy.com, eBay and CNN.com using "Denial of Service" attacks that overloaded the sites' servers with an inordinate number of data requests.

<Smudger> Newbies Who Think They Know Everything!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today it's about newbie users(those who've been fortunate to get a computer with a modem and an internet connection) 
I don't mean the ordinary person who comes into a yahoo chatroom and says "hi! I'm new to this, can you help?". 
Oh No! I mean that pain in the arse type user whos managed to figure out how to use mIRC and comes onto an IRC network 
and pretends thier totally elite in the ways of the net, start to piss people off with thier bullshitty crap about how they can fuck up 
everyones computer just by the click of thier mouse button.Yup they went to one of those expliot sites and downloaded WinNuke 
and now they think thier hackers! 
That the sort of person i mean but, thats not all I'm also talking about the other types who browse through endless amounts 
of websites (The 14 year olds are usually trying to find p0rn), come across a site whos owner they know, and begin taking the piss out of that site saying how shit it is and how patheticly gay the owner is. The fact is that gimpish foolstil thinks that http is some sort of brown sauce not unlike 
daddies sauce, and that Macromedia Flash is for the fucking kitchen floor! 
Who the fuck do these people think they are for fucks sake!! 
I've no doubt thier intellegent people in real life but why the fuck do they insist on pretending to be sommit thier not. They will get found out 
and in the end the joke WILL be on them when they foolishly open an e-amil entitled "I love you" see the attatchment and open the thing without 
realising it is, in fact, a vbs script which does some rather unsettling things to you're computer (I call it Ignorance). Not forgetting the know it all newbies who accept what they think is an mpeg p0rn movie of two pesbians sticking 12" dildos up each others arses(you know who you are you fucking perverts! does you're mommy know you look at that shit?!?) from a complete stranger on IRC not realising it's either a virus or a trojan horse of some sort(which I've sadly had the pleasure of fucking up my hard drive). But you know despite the fact I'm taking the piss out of you out there there is some advice in here as well(ahh fuck I should've just let you fuck up you're hard drive but I'm such a nice guy ;)) 
I've been using the Internet now for over two years and I still consider myself new-ish and, despite what you read here Im always willing to help someone whos new to this mallarky. 
I say to you out there who are "newbies who think they know everything" (I won't mention names but, there nowt wrong with looking (o)(o). ) 
Stop being fuckwits! Listen to you're peers (I usually get my connection reset by mine), and for fucks sake stop going to those expliot sites, downloading a windows expliot, then thinking you are "3r33t h4x0rz"! 
Go play under a bus instead.(mind you thats one lamer off the net)

<PaRiS> Bushido; Its Relation to, and in comparison with Ethical Hacking behvaiour...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The way of the Samurai. Bushido. But what does that actually mean? And is it really possible to relate the ethics of an ancient belief system (Note not Religion, but Belief System; kinda like the difference between a fact and an idea in this context) to those of the modern day, much mis-understood, mis-represented and thus mis interprited "hacking" (using the term loosley) Culture (Some would argue, also using this term loosely). 

Lets start by analysing the actual meaning of Bushido "The Way of The Samurai". This term trantionally refers to the moral code principals that developed among the Samurai (military) class of Japan, on a basis of national tradition influenced by Zen and Confucianism. 

The first use of the term apparently occured during the civil war period of the 16th century; its precise content varied historically as samurai standards evolved. Its one unchanging ideal was martial spirit, including athletic and military skills as well as fearless facing of the enemy in battle. Frugal living, kindness and honesty were also highly regarded. Like Confucianism, Bushido required filial piety; but, originating in the feudal system, it also held that supreme honour was to serve one's lord unto death. If these obligations conflicted, the samurai was bound by loyalty to his lord despite the suffering he might cause to his parents.

The final rationalization of Bushido thought occured during the Tokugawa period (17th century ff.), when Yamaga Soko (1622-85) equated the samurai with the Confucian "superior man" and taught that his essential function was to exemplify virtue to the lower classes. Without disregarding the basic Confucian virtue, benevolence, Soko enphasized the second virtue, righteousness, which he interpreted as "obligation" or "duty". This strict code of honour, affecting matters of life and death, demanded conscious choice and so fostered individual initiative while yet reasserting the obligations of loyalty and filial piety. Obedience to authority was stressed, but duty came first even if it entailed violation of statue law. In such an instance, the true samurai would prove his sincerity and expiate his crime against the government by subsequently taking his own life.

By mid-19th century, Bushido standards had become the general ideal, and the legal abolition of the samurai class in 1871 made Bushido even more the property of the entire nation. In the public educational system, with the emperor replacing the feudal lord as the object of loyalty and sacrifice, Bushido bacame the foundation of ethical training. As such, it contributed both to the rise of Japanese nationalism and to the strengthening of wartime civilian morale up to 1945.

Bushido was the guiding philosophy of the samurai, or bushi (military gentry), as they were commonly called. It has often been compared to the code of chivalry followed by European knights. Perhaps bushido's aim was the same, namely to provide a code of honor and rules for living for the country's armed forces. But bushido is uniquely Eastern. It was born of a blend of Buddhism, Chu-Tsu, Confucius and Shinto, and though officially introduced in the seventeenth century, it was ingrained in the bushi from the time of their origin. 

Following are the eight principles of bushido: 

Jin - to develop a sympathetic understanding of people 
Gi - to preserve the correct ethics 
Chu - to show loyalty to one's master 
Ko - to respect and to care for one's parents 
Rei - to show respect for others 
Chi - to enhance wisdom by broadening one's knowledge 
Shin - to be truthful at all times 
Tei - to care for the aged and those of a humble station 

And how does this relate to Hackers? Well... In the tradinal lexicon of Hacking jargon the term Samurai has a very definate meaning, and one which is perhaps out of date in this the era of the "Commercial Internet". The meaning was traditionally this:

Samurai: n. A hacker who hires out for legal cracking jobs, snooping for factions in corporate political fights, lawyers pursuing privacy-rights and First Amendment cases, and other parties with legitimate reasons to need an electronic locksmith. In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence of a loose-knit culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS systems, mostly bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled themselves explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the "net cowboys" of William Gibson's cyberpunk novels. Those interviewed claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to their employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic; some quote Miyamoto Musashi's "Book of Five Rings", a classic of historical samurai doctrine, in support of these principles. See also sneaker, Stupids, social engineering, cracker, hacker ethic, and dark-side hacker. 

Other Definition from this traditional lexicon (and relating to the above definition) are below:

hacker ethic: n. 1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. 

dark-side hacker: n. A criminal or malicious hacker; a cracker. From George Lucas's Darth Vader, "seduced by the dark side of the Force". The implication that hackers form a sort of elite of technological Jedi Knights is intended. Oppose samurai. 

So... Lets start with these traditional "Samurai Hackers". Does there "ethics"/behaviour warrent to word "Samurai?" Lets put their ethics up against the Bushido Code:

Jin - to develop a sympathetic understanding of people...
---------------------------------------------------------
Its hard to see Hacking Samurai as doing this, considering their distain for so called Dark Side Hackers. Surely a Hacker (so clued up on the scene as these guys tend to consider themselves) should at least appriciate where dark side hackers are coming from? ie. The "Who Dares Wins" principle (or general arachy in cyberspace theme). Hacking Samurai and jin? 4/10. If that. 

Gi - to preserve the correct ethics...
--------------------------------------
Yes. Hacking Samurai do preserve ethics. This much is clear. However... only because they have to remain within the law? Are ethics under threat of arbitury punishment REALLY ethics? Debatable.

Chu - to show loyalty to one's master... 
----------------------------------------
Loyalty. Refering to your master as a "Suit" or a "Stupid" is an odd kind of loyalty. And putting it bluntly, Samurai were not paid for loyalty. They were not Bounty Hunters or Hired Guns like the Hacking Samurai. Loyalty for money is no loyalty at all in my opinion and Im sure the 16th Century Samurai would agree with me whole heartedly.

Ko - to respect and to care for one's parents... 
------------------------------------------------
Largely irrelevent in the 21st century and in this context; but I doubt a Samurai Hackers wage check is shared with his parents if you catch my drift.

Rei - to show respect for others...
-----------------------------------
The Samurai showed respect for their enemys. Something Hacking Samurai have failed to do, time and time again. The Samurai showed respect for their masters. Again Hacking Samurai FAIL to do this. And the Samurai had respect for the "lower" classes, the 16th century equivilent of the Newbie? Maybe. Maybe not.

Chi - to enhance wisdom by broadening one's knowledge...
--------------------------------------------------------
All hackers do this.

Shin - to be truthful at all times... 
-------------------------------------
Doubtfull. 

Tei - to care for the aged and those of a humble station... 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Again largely irrelevent but also largely doubtfull.



Now (here comes the science part) lets take the Bushido Code and relate it the other hackers... ie. not Samurai. Im not gonna score this; you can work it out for your selves, but the results will be self evident.

Jin - to develop a sympathetic understanding of people... 
---------------------------------------------------------
Hackers HAVE to do this to partake in any form of social engineering. Its true. How can you be expected to fool anyone without understanding them? Hackers have to be virtual psycologists to perform the most impressive feats of social engineering.

Gi - to preserve the correct ethics... 
--------------------------------------
Most, although admitedly not all hackers follow some variation of hacking ethics - and most who dont generally dont have the skillz to cause problems anyway. 

Chu - to show loyalty to one's master... 
----------------------------------------
Hackers are notoriously loyal to their "groups" and or friends. Hence multiple flame wars and a certain amount of seemingly random site defacements. I think that counts.

Ko - to respect and to care for one's parents... 
------------------------------------------------
Man... I shoulda left this one out. ;)

Rei - to show respect for others... 
-----------------------------------
Hackers teach each other. Respect each other and (unless they are complete lamers) show a certain degree of respect for newbies willing to learn their "art".

Chi - to enhance wisdom by broadening one's knowledge... 
--------------------------------------------------------
All Hackers to this.

Shin - to be truthful at all times... 
-------------------------------------
Well Sadly no, and indeed Social Engineering would be impossible if this section of the Busido Code was followed. But is ANYONE not lie these days?

Tei - to care for the aged and those of a humble station... 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yeah I know :).


So. We have anaylised both "Sides" of Hacking, the dark and the light (Who call themselves Samurai) and it seems that the definitions (of the traditional Lexicon) are somewhat incorrect. So Called Darkside Hackers resemble 16h century Samurai much more than so called Samurai do. And neither in honesty bear a "Striking" resemblence. However...

The areas of the Bushido Code which Hackers (From here on in the term refers to Darkside Hackers, having proven that "Samurai" Hackers are, well nothing better than Sellout-SysOp, failing perhaps the most important aspect of Bushido: respect for one's Master) adhire to are interesting.

[The Neo-Bushido Code]

Chi	- to enhance wisdom by broadening one's knowledge... 
Chu 	- to show loyalty to one's master [Friends]... 
Jin 	- to develop a sympathetic understanding of people... 
Gi 	- to preserve the correct ethics...

The fundemtals in my opinion; and most that are not adhired to are largely relics of a "more noble time". So what does this tell us, and what was the point of this contradictory essay? Well... just to let you know about Bushido mainly. lol. Seriously... One could suggest that current hacking ethics are kind of Neo-Bushido, incorporating all the most important eliments of the Samurai's code. And that thus, any hacker who wants, and thinks they live up to the high standards of The Neo-Bushido Code; can call them selves Samurai.

<PaRiS> Lamer's Guide to Sp00fing IRC...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is Spoofing?
-----------------
Spoofing is a phase that has been cunningly adopted to describe the practise of "Faking" (Or more accuratly on Win O/S) "Borrowing" someone elses IP (Interner Protacol Address) and using it as your own for certain tasks (Such as, in this case IRC). In effect spoofing enables you to look like someone else. It will change both your HOST name (ie if your usual address is Lamer@aol.lamers.com you can spoof to, for example, NotLame@proxy1.spaceproxy.com) and IP Address (Your Resolved IP address will no longer be the "AOL" address but instead will be that of Spaceproxy.com in this example).

Why Spoof?
----------
There are hundreds of reasons to spoof on the internet. Privicy, research (Learning how TCP/IP works) or even plane simple mayhem making. The uses of spoofing are vast, and I'll not go into them all here; this is a how to, not a why to.

So How do I do It?
------------------
Im gonna phrase this very, very simply because even some not-so-lame ppl I have tried to explain this to have got lost. I dont know why maybe its my communications skillz. So here goes. 

1. Setting up a "Tunnel" (Connection to a Proxy Server). 
--------------------------------------------------------
Theoretically you can connect to a proxy server DIRECT from your IRC Client. But if you can do that, you really dont need to be reading this guide. There fore the easiet way to set up a "Tunnel" is with a program which has been written for the task. One good Program for this is Calamus 1.5.

http://www.8th-wonder.net/main.html

Download it from the above site (and ppl to whome we are all most greatfull) and install. Load it up; you will be faces with three data areas to fill in. The "Proxy Server" The "Destination" and the ports for each of these. 

The "Proxy Server" should speak for its self. Just enter a proxy server (A good list of which can be found at www.cyberarmy.com). The destination server is simply "Where you want to go" for example, if you want to spoof onto DALnet input a DALnet server (Such as Hebron.dal.net), simple! The ports are mentioned along side the specific examples (They will be listed along with the address in the case of proxys, and in the case of IRC spoofing the standard IRC ports; 6667, 7000 etc should be entered in the destination port area.)

Once you have entered the above data, hit "Connect". Now load you IRC client. Connect to 127.0.0.1 1080 (/server 127.0.0.1 1080 - You local Host port 1080). Calamus should greet you with a short message (It has opened up a "Redirect" server (or IP "Tunnel") on your port 1080), then redirect you to the Proxy Server, which is turn will redirect you to the IRC Server. See below Diagram.


MiRC -> Calamus 1.5 Server -> Your desired Proxy Server -> IRC Server.


Connecting to the IRC Server (Fooling it)
-----------------------------------------
Once you have connected to the IRC Server (This may take some time varying from proxy to proxy: And some proxy will not accept IRC class connections at all, this usually require some expirimentation) you will be greeted with *some* of the usual inpho you are greeted with when you connect with MiRC. 

The Server will however stop sort of actually connecting you. Why? The Proxy server is NOT giving it all the information that MiRC would, after all its a proxy server not a MiRc client. You will have to manually (Or script) some raw login information. This is Simple.

Firstly you must request a nickname on the server with a raw command. Type /raw nick [Your Desired Nick] in your IRC client THEN...

Secondly you must request other user details. Type /raw user [Your Username (Ie "THIS"@whatever.org) X X [Something to go in the "Real Name" area, which appears after your host name in a /whois.) Once you have done this. The IRC Server should allow your connection and you may use IRC as normal. /whois and /dns yourself to be sure you are happy with the degree to which you are "Hidden". 

Notes:
------
Not sure if its Calamus or the Proxy's Ive been using, but when sp00fed I have a tendancy to time out... and fall off. Takes a few hours though so for non-idler's this should not be a problem.

You can sp00f ANYTHING not just IRC. Http spoofing is as simple as changing the destination to a website and connecting to the same 12.7.0.0.1:1080 as you would with MiRc buyt with your browser, and FTP is as simple as entering raw login information (as with IRC) expiriment. The Tunnel Created buy Calmaus is quote versitile (But only as flexable as the proxy you use it with). Have fun and dont cause to much chaos. And remember: There is always someone bigger, bader, and who has a better trace rewt proggie than you, be carefull; your spoofed not fucking Superman. Werd.

ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA
(-In their full glory-)

DESCRIPTION:
A MARXIST-LENINIST ARMENIAN TERRORIST GROUP FORMED IN 1975 WITH THE STATED INTENTION OF COMPELLING THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY TO ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY ITS ALLEGED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATHS OF 1.5 MILLION ARMENIANS IN 1915, PAY REPARATIONS, AND CEDE TERRIRTORY FOR AN ARMENIAN HOMELAND. LED BY HAGOP HAGOPIAN UNTIL HIS ASSASSINATION IN ATHENS IN APRIL, 1988.

(-Most people just go and buy their own Island or something, I mean as if the government would give you a homeland because you feel that they were wankers-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ACTIVITIES:
INITIAL BOMBING AND ASSASSINATION ATTACKS WERE DIRECTED AGAINST TURKISH TARGETS.  ASALA LATER ATTACKED FRENCH AND SWISS TARGETS TO FORCE THE RELEASE OF IMPRISONED COMRADES.  MADE SEVERAL MINOR BOMBING ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. AIRLINE OFFICES IN WESTERN EUROPE IN EARLY 1980S.  BOMBING OF TURKISH AIRLINE COUNTER AT ORLY AIRPORT IN PARIS - SEVEN KILLED AND 55 INJURED - LED TO A SPLIT IN THE GROUP OVER THE ISSUE OF CAUSING INDISCRIMINATE CASUALTIES. SUFFERING FROM INTERNAL SCHISMS, THE GROUP HAS BEEN RELATIVELY INACTIVE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

(-Yes yes yes, some old shit in the same countries, no originality here except for a cool name for their group.  The fact that half of them became soft and left cos people were getting killed, I mean what the fuck does a terrorist group do hand out lollies to sick kids? -)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRENGTH:
SEVERAL HUNDRED

(-Thats a lie, they have 6, but 3 left cos of the killing that terrorists do-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOCATION/AREA OF OPERATION:
LEBANON; EUROPE; UNITED STATES.

(-Trained in Lebanon, stupid enough to get caught so they start of Europe to release their boys and its a tradition, an old charter or something to attack the US-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTERNAL AID:
HAS RECEIVED AID, INCLUDING TRAINING AND SAFEHAVEN, FROM SYRIA.  MAY
ALSO HAVE RECEIVED SOME AID FROM LIBYA.  EXTENSIVE TIES TO RADICAL
PALESTINIAN GROUPS, INCLUDING THE PFLP, PFLP-GC, AND THE ABU NIDAL
ORGANIZATION

(-Go on the Adu Nidals!!!-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

POLITICAL OBJECTIVES/TARGET AUDIENCES:
*  USE REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE TO FORCE AN END TO THE "EXPLOITATION,
REPRESSION, AND TERROR OF TURKISH COLONIALISM" AND THE "IMPERIALISM" OF NATO AND ZIONISM;
*  ATTACK TURKISH REPRESENTATIVES AND INTERESTS WORLDWIDE, AS WELL AS
INTERESTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT TURKEY;
*  AFFIRM "SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM" AS THE POLITICAL DOCTRINE OF THE
RECONSTITUTED ARMENIAN HOMELAND;
*  TRANSFORM "SOVIET" ARMENIA INTO  A BASE FOR REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE
AGAINST TURKEY.

(-Zionist's, kill them all!!. "We are 6, Nata are millions, LET'S HAVE 'EM"-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

BACKGROUND:
ASALA IS A TRANSNATIONAL  (-a what?-), ETHNIC TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT ESPOUSES A MARXIST-LENINIST POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND SOLIDARITY WITH LEFTIST AND SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS WORLDWIDE.  ITS PRIMARY GOAL IS REESTABLISHING THE HISTORICAL ARMENIAN HOMELAND, AN AREA THAT INCLUDES EASTERN TURKEY, NORTHERN IRAN, AND ARMENIA (OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES).  (-Anything else with those fries?-) ASALA ALSO DEMANDS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT FROM TURKEY FOR THE ALLEGED GENOCIDE OF ARMENIANS DURING THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, AS WELL AS AN END TO THE DISCRIMINATION THEY CLAIM ARMENIANS SUFFER IN TURKEY. (-I confess it was me-)
TO FURTHER ITS GOALS ASALA HAS COMMITTED A SERIES OF ASSASSINATIONS,
BOMBINGS, AND ASSAULTS.  ASALA TERRORISM HAS PROGRESSED THROUGH TWO PHASES.
DURING THE FIRST PHASE, THE GROUP CARRIED OUT ATTACKS AGAINST TURKISH
DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS IN ORDER TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE
"ARMENIAN QUESTION" AND GAIN SUPPORT AMONG ARMENIANS. (-Thats what they wanted-) 
IN THE SECOND PHASE ASALA EXPANDED ITS OPERATIONS TO INCLUDE ATTACKS AGAINST "IMPERIALIST" TARGETS. 
(-Now we see them go off the fuckin head-) 
THE FIRST OF THESE WERE BOMBINGS IN NOVEMBER, 1979, AGAINST KLM AND LUFTHANSA OFFICES IN PARIS AND TWA'S OFFICE IN MADRID.  IN ADDITION, THE GROUP LAUNCHED ATTACKS AGAINST THE CITIZENS AND PROPERTY OF COUNTRIES HOLDING ASALA MEMBERS IN PRISONS.
THE POLICY OF INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE AND DISPUTES OVER LEADERSHIP
EVENTUALLY CAUSED A SPLIT IN ASALA.  
FOLLOWING THE JULY, 1983 ASALA BOMBING OF THE TURKISH AIRLINES TICKET COUNTER AT ORLY AIRPORT, PARIS, THAT KILLED SEVEN, A DISSIDENT GROUP, ASALA-RM, WAS FORMED.  ASALA-RM VIEWED INDISCRIMINATE "BLIND" TERRORISM AS DETRIMENTAL TO THE ARMENIAN CAUSE AND FAVORED LIMITNG TERRORIST ATTACKS TO TURKISH TARGETS.  ASALA-M CONTINUED TO FAVOR UNRESTRICTED TERRORISM AGAINST TURKISH AS WELL AS "IMPERIALIST" TARGETS.
FOLLOWING THE SPLIT, ASALA'S MEMBERS WERE APPARENTLY PREOCCUPIED IN
AN INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN TERRORIST OPERATIONS. ASALA, HOWEVER, WAS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN AMONG THOSE GROUPS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF BOMBINGS IN PARIS IN LATE 1986 THAT KILLED AND INJURED SOME 200.
THE ATTACKS WERE CLAIMED BY THE "COMMITTEE FOR SOLIDARITY WITH ARAB AND
MIDDLE EASTERN PRISONERS" AND WERE INTENDED TO PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT OF
FRANCE TO RELEASE THREE SUSPECTED TERORORIST PRISONERS, INCLUDING ASALA
MEMBER, VAROUJAN GARABEDJIAN. (-Did it work, Did it fuck-)

<PaRiS> The Minx Project...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minx. What a fantastic Idea (Code for MiRC in an above article). Instant txt transfer from a site on the web INTO your MiRC client, and about 1000 times faster than a web browser. Why? This is the common question I've been asked since seeing the potential. I shall explain.


1. Why the hell do you want to see flashy GFX when all you want is to know how to do something?
2. I doubt there could be a better way of storing MiRC scripts. You can cut n paste them directly INTO your own, without messing around - Download with IE, open in notepad (checking for hostile cod3), transfer over etc etc.
3. Easily updatable. No "Design needed". Thus easy to maintain.
4. TINY. Minx site's take up no space what so ever, and a vast inph0 archive is thus easy to host, and easy to develop. 
5. *.minx ext is not know to Ie/Netscape etc (Because I thought it up) thus, only ppl who know how to open it (ie its a txt doc...) will be able to see it. Minx files generally just look like cgi data etc. Thus... Minx sites are hidden to all but those who have heard about them in Zine's like this. No prying "Angelfire" staff etc.


Still not convinced? Well bugger you then, cos its happening. The SOL Minx site is already up! all you have to do is install the Minx script into your MiRC and connect to...

www.angelfire.com/va2/luckstruck/minx.minx <---- Check it out and tell me this ISNT a good idea seeing as its so easy to maintain.

Any of YOUR minx sites will be linked, just mail em to me at minx@sanction.org.uk

It might be possible to read minx sites with a WAP phone as well, i personally think they are shite so I've not tried. I thank you.
