<PaRiS> Editorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well looks like we are a bit short on shit for this issue, Im hardly suprised though considering A) The amount of other shit the krew are getting up to, and B) The distances traveled for the purposes of drinking/substance abuse by the said krew in the last month. Who said Lam3 pirates never have any phun? Ppl who know me will be suprised to hear Im actually in a much happier state of mind. I believe the phraze was "I aint got no money, you dont get paid. bow!"

Time for the house keeping...

Just for the record Id like to state that the ex-sol member Urza is not so bad; and has been helping us out with a number of things of late. Him and SOL where just not meant to be. So lets all just let sleeping dogs lie.

Ive nearly finished my album, so you can all go phuck off :) erm... Thats phuck off and BUY it when it comes out. *grin* Its nice returning to ones routes. I was always just the music man, and now Im basically doing that again. "ahhhhhhhhhhhh".

SOL is not a democracy! :) This is a statment shared by the adminz, and Id just like to make it clear that power will always start, stop and go through the founders; as long as they are still in the (dis) organisation. 

Ill be cutting the film parodys from the next issue; because they are getting GAY. Im sure Ill think of something to replace them. Im inventive like that; you should all, in the mean time, check out the SoljO bi-annual which will be available from all the usual places and is being edited by llama. Should be phun.

Ive been getting stressed recently. It happens. 

On a more serious note; Id just like to point out a few bits of SOL policy just to make it clear to everyone. I think the whole underground is loosing... and loosing sight of why it was formed. So here is SOL's manefesto...

1. Unconditional information sharing and publication. If we can, we should.
2. Preventing commercialisation though the (mis) use of telecomunications technology.
3. SOL will NOT tolorate "Selling out". Once pirates, always pirates.

I thank you. One love. Never phear the gear.

<Llama> Bath Mission Report...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operation: Bladdered

Mission: 
--------
1. Go to Bath
1. Get very, very drunk (Llama's plan)
2. See some ducks (Paris's plan)

London, Friday night, 9.30
--------------------------

Paris and Llama are in the pub. There, they plan the next day. The
plan was:

1. Llama wakes up, and phones Paris at 9.30
2. They leave for Harrow at 10.00
3. Llama gets money, and checks on work.
4. At 12.30, they go home
5. Change, and go to Heathrow Airport
6. Catch coach for Bath at 1.30
7. Get drunk
8. See Ducks [Ed]


London, Saturday morning, 9.30
------------------------------

Llama wakes up. He phones Paris. Told to "Fuck off". Phones again.
(repeat). Success at 10.00. Paris and Llama go to Harrow at 10.30.
Get there for 11.15 Disaster strikes there, as the Halifax bank's
computers completly fail. Llama has to queue for 30 minutes to get
some money. Llama checks on work. Get home at 12.30. Decide to catch
coach at 2.30. Inform Godfree. We get changed. We leave for Heathrow
airport at 1.30. Get on coach at 2.30 (Skipping all the people who had
been waiting for 2 hours) [Stroke of PaRiS Magick... - Ed]. We sleep on 
coach.


Bath, West country, Saturday afternoon, 5.30
--------------------------------------------

On coach journey spotted the following things.

1. Scaramanga's Car dealer. (Thats what he did after Bond)
2. Badgerline buses. (Much to the delight of PaRiS)
3. The fact that our mobile phones both are out of charge.

We got off the coach. Frantic scribbling as we write down Godfree's
number before the phone cuts out. Phone Godfree from payphone. Get
instructions to where he is. Walk up Marchants Passage (Ooer) and walk
the wrong way. Twice. Find Godfree and Comrade in the Hobgoblin.
Greet. Godfree shows us his "Gun". Drink 3 pints each. Godfree and
Comrade have Red Bulls (Note: Caffine is NOT an acceptable substitute
for alcohol). Paris and Llama discuss when to move from pints to
mixers. Paris says 3, Llama says 10. Llama wins. Move on to pub which
I cannot remember the name of. Drink another 3 pints. Godfree and
Comrade now move on to pints. Go to cash machine where more money is
removed (Halifax got their act together). Go to student style
housing. Meet Helen, Tasmin and other goth type people. Fired the
"gun" at targets while people hold them. Paris nearly lost an arm,
Comrade a finger. Went to "The Midland" and drank more. Played pool.
Paris beats Llama. Godfree beats Paris. Llama beats Godfree. Helen
performs the "Bird from Goldeneye" attack on Paris. Paris is on floor
in 2 seconds, screaming. Sang "Bohiemian Rapsody" by Queen (Kareoke).
Drank some more. Played drinking games. Llama ends up with a pint over
his head. We move on....


Bath, Still in the West country [Suprisingly Citys DONT move - ed], Saturday evening, 11.30
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Found kebab shop. Llama purchaces kebab, which he eats. Go to
Godfree's workplace. On IRC, claim that we are "Pisded!". Went to
exile, Bath's resident Goth club. On the way, Paris insults someone
from Sunderland by claiming that "You are a Geordie". Get to Exile.
Drink even more. Llama performs the first "Goth foam party" after
having the head of a pint blown at him. This was performed as follows.

1. Get a pint of beer, and drink half.
2. Use another glass, and smack it against the rim of the pint.
3. Repeat until the head reaches the top of the pint glass.
4. Point and blow.

Llama managed to blow into, and not across the pint. Result - Beer
foam everywhere. Helen pours pint over Llamas head. Passed the 10 pint
limit, and move on to Bacardi and Cokes. Paris gets chatted up by
Paddy, a gay bloke. Paris escapes by claiming "I'm not like that, but
if I was, you would be first on the list". Godfree takes picture of
Paris's knob in the toilets. Llama, Paris and Godfree leave, and go to
Godfree's house. Very cold. Sleep the best we can.


Bath, Sunday morning , 10.00
----------------------------

We wake, and make our way to McDonalds. Eat breakfast. Go into the
centre of Bath. Saw ducks on the river [Yay! - ed]. Went to the Roman Baths and
walked round them. Watched street performs run around in thongs,
generally being as rude as possible to foreigners, setting fire to
themselves and doing acrobatics. Checked Hobgoblin to see if it was
open. It wasn't. Walk around, check again. Repeat for an hour. Enter
shop selling "Magnetic Lenin Dress-me-up Dolls" among other things.
Sit in Hobgoblin, watching rugby, until 3.45, when Paris and Llama
leave for the coach station. at 4.00, they leave on the coach, heading
back to London.

**MISSION ENDS**

Mission 1. 11 pints, 5 Barcardis and cokes. Each
Mission 2. Saw some ducks

Result: Success

What we have learnt.

1. The Halifax bank is gay.
2. So is the National Express.
3. Scaramanga is still alive.
4. Don't let pissed people fire "Guns".
5. Goths don't like Foam parties.
6. Heating happens to other people in the West Country.

<SOL> cF^ Are A Bunch Of Lame Script Kiddies...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cF^ are a group of mainly Amiga users who hang out the notoriously lame #amirc channel on DALnet. They keep thier "Movements" and "Organisation" a secret and all are present in the chanserv protected invite only channel #^cF at all times. Know the kind of ppl Im talking about yet? No one knows "what" they do, but we are assured by its membership that cF^ does has a point, but SOL can now reveal what CF *really* are...!

Logs begin in the SOL channel #luckstruck on Dalnet at 5am GMT, myself and Geeza (aka BaDgEr) are tired and just chatting. Enter the ^cF krew...

<InfinityMatrix> The Hackers Poem...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sitting at my computer
on a lonely night dreary
the iridescent glow from my monitor
my eyes quite bleary

telnetting from host to host
checking for vulnerability
testing all the exploits
of much complexity

at last, i've found one!
oh dear, it's phf.
a very old security hole
at this i chuff.

i run the exploit
qalias and all
the passwd file uncovered
by midnight the host will fall

i scour over the passwd file
i execute jack the ripper
i run my custom wordlist
i wish this cracking would go quicker

i sit at my desk
drinking my jolt cola
waiting for jack to complete it's run
but alas, a call on my motorola!

i pick it up, flip it open.
"hello?" i say
i cant hear anything, the phone must be broken
but i call a test sweep, everything is okay.

i sigh and put the phone down
looking at the screen, i see jack is done
grinning with glee
i see jack has completed his run

i start up telnet
a shoot a try at the host
i login as root
it works! i go on IRC to boast.

i connect to efnet
and brag about my latest achievement
in all the best channels
all the logs to my friends are sent

but suddenly, with no warning
all of the ops proclaim me lame
oh no, it's all done!
i've had my 15 minutes of fame

all the ops say phf sucks
"it's old, and it's stupid" 
i frown and cry
my eliteness has been avoided

soon i hear a rap, rap
a rapping at my door
i wonder, what could it be?
i have never had any visitors this late before.

i slumber over to my door
i open it up
i see a group of men standing there
this must be a mixup

one of the men lifts a gun
this cannot be good
"hello" the man says
"i'm agent atwood."

they turn me around 
slam me into the wall
i watch in terror
as they storm down my hall

i scream bloody murder
as they carry my computer to their vehicles
they carry me out too
the leader of the group chortles

they drive me to jail
i'm about to crap my pants with fear
as i start to cry
the agents tell me why i'm here

"you have been charged with possesion trade secrets"
"and violation of the computer fraud and abuse act of 1986."
i am extremely scared now
and i'm feeling a pain in my appendix

they put my sorry butt in jail
next to a huge murderer named bubba
i'm scared of him
he wants me to be his lover

after i got bailed out by my mom
she made me give up my computer
but the hacker in me still lives
oh well, i guess i'll always be an amateur.

<PaRiS> Us 'n' Them...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Its brilliant is'nt it. The underground. Such a sense of unity amung fellows. My arse. Is it me or is everyone in the underground, the Pirates, the Hackers, the Warezd00ds, *everyone*, suposed to help one another out; after all, are we not suposed to be on the same side?

Some so called "Ethical Hackers" would claim that (equaly so called) "Warez" go against their moral's. However, lets face it, when it all comes down to the eyes of society we are ALL just criminals. And until this isnt the case, with is almost the same as saying until it is accepted that what we all do is the "right" thing to do, i.e Freedom of Information (in whatever form), as far as most are concerned there is NO DIFFERENCE between ethical hackers, "Dark" hackers, Warez doods and anyone else who engages in illegal activites via telecomunications and computer technology.

Whats the difference between gaining access to a computer via convert/stolen/an entrace thats not meant to be used and copying the odd overpriced piece of software? (And lets face it, very few Freeware programs are ever cracked n packed!).

Dispite a million moral arguments one could shout at me, in the eyes of the law; there is no difference. And their wont be; Im a realist. Hacking is never going to become legal (unless its computer securitys testing ;) and nor is software piracy. In *fact* its more likly (however UNlikly) that all software is going to be given over FREE in the future, than it is that governments will relax their information protection legislation (The former is covered under old copyright laws the later has still not been ammended into a fit state; hence cases like Kevin Mitnick).

The point is this... Be u a Hacker, or a Pirate (or whatever lil place you wanna pigeon whole yourself into). Your all in the same boat. It therefore amazes me the amount of SHIT that goes on between the two respective camps (and dont get me wrong, a lil idle banter is fine, keeps the moral up, but). Sometimes the scene resembles the crew of a sinking ship, using the time to settle old scores. Ppl, in case you hadnt noticed; WE ARE LOOSING. The Net is as corporate as its ever been, and countrys are bringing in harsher and harsher laws to do with computer and telecommunications technology. Partialy due to the selling out of many ppl who started in the underground and now werk for the "other side". (Although in real life, who can REALLY blame someone for making money? So I wont linger on that point, frankly Im amazed IM still here...)

Recently the Luckstruck site was denied a place on Hacknet because it was said to be Warez based, this is just stupid. Not because its my site (I couldnt give a toss where it is to be honest) but thats such an odd reason to not let it in (Add to this the fact that the site, and sol as a whole these days has little to do with Warez at all. Bad research? I think so...).

I was under the impression, and always have been since I got involved with all this shit LONG before the net was a feesable way of information sharing that FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, and ultimately information sharing was the point. Hacknet obvioulsly disagree, placing the petty rivelrey between pirates and hackers ahead of this. And they are not alone. When are people of the underground going to understand what they are actually fighting for?

Back in the old days, when the Net and the whole underground scene was founded; they knew why they did it. Maybe you should all ask yourselves if you do.

<PaRiS> Revised Rules and Guidelines For The Trophy Game...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the world of extreme drinking games... Just because I've listed some things don't mean you have to catch em all. This is NOT Pokemon. Play this game at your own risk...

Game: 
-----
The game is simple; collection of various objects from around a specified area and bringing together these said objects to another specified "Drop Zone" within an allocated time limit. Each object is worth a certain amount of points. The person, or team, with the most points after adding up objects in the "Drop Zone" after the time limit has expired wins. The game *must* be played drunk.


Advised Time Scale:
-------------------
Its advised that the time scale be of a "medium" variety. Around 3 Hours. Any less then that and its hard to find anything interesting and any more makes things get a little tedious. But hey! Try it out for your selves.


Advised "Drop Zones":
---------------------
Parks have to be the best choice. But the location of the Drop Zone can also change the "Danger Level" of the game. For example; locating your Drop Zone in a police station car park could be fun. And add to the excitment of Extreme Drinking.


Advised Rules for "End of Game" Tallyup:
----------------------------------------
Only things/people that are in the Drop Zone at the END of the game can be counted. So if that bouncer you convinced to turn up has walked off; tough luck. This is the only rule we think should be strictly enforced.

<PaRiS> K-rad Guide To Pokemon...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to my short guide to Pokemon. Its been along time since Ive written a Guide to anything, and infact I think the last guide I wrote was prolly for Elite II on the Amiga (quite awhile ago). The Reason? I dont play games that much these days, which goes to show how good I think Pokemon is *grin* Not only do I play it, Ive written this. So Peace out and listen up. 


K-rad things to know about this GuIdE
=====================================

1. I can get you Mew (Oh yes).
2. You CAN play Pokemon on your PC (Although you cant save the game).


Playing Pokemon on a PC
=======================

Practically any PC worth its weight in Kit-Kat Chunky Bars (mmmmmmm...) can run a Game Boy Emulator, and by far the best, even though it takes a bit of fiddling to get it just right for your machine is No$GMB. Recently, according to its homepage, someones been ripping it off. Well... 'Tis a Warez program, expect piracy! And with that said and done, get it (and loadsa other useful stuff, incluing the games themselves) from:

http://www.angelfire.com/ga2/pokemon30/

Pls note Lameboy emulators can be wierd about file saving so dont be suprised if you loose everything from time to time, my advice, dont turn ya PC off and keep the app running (if my 1.33 16meg ram laptop can do it so can yourz) also bare in mind Ive written this guide from playing Pokemon Blue, I cant be bothered to test compatability. No one said I was The Alien (He of fantastically detailed Doc philes), so here goes.


The Basic's
===========

- The first thing you should know about the game is this really; the Pokemon you choose to take from Prof.Oak sets the difficulty of the game... Bulbasuar is the Easy mode, Squrtle is Medium and Charmanda is Hard.

- Dont forget to get the TOWN MAP from your arch-ememys house b4 you embark on your Poke'journey. His sister will hand it over despite what he says; she obviously thinks he is a little prick as well.

- Repel unsuprisingly keeps Pokemon away.

- Make it your mission to carry lots of pokeball's and catch everything you can ONCE. 


Hints that make life Ea5y
=========================

- Escape Ropes help you escape from caves instantly. Although why u would do this is anyones guess :/.

- Zubats are phatt, and easy to catch.

- Rock Pokemon get their arses whipped by Boulbasaur (and anything it evolves into's) move "Vine Whip" (Learnt at Level 13). Some other plant type Pokemon have this skill too. It really is *Super Effective*. Vine Whip also werks well against Rattatanatanan's's. :)

- Electric Pokemon work real well against ALL Flying Pokemon. (zzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaap!).

- Water Pokemon werk real well against Electric Pokemon (No shit, Fizzle Fizzle; fried Squirtle).

- Calling yout arch enemy "Ladyboy" or "Gaylord" can really boost your morale.

- Giovanni is one of the Harder Vampire Clans in Vampire the Masqurade. Amusingly Giovanni is the name of the sinister leader of Team Rocket.

- Pressing the B button during Evolution STOPS the process. This has its up and down points; evolved Pokemon are naturally stronger, however un-evolved Pokemon learn new skills faster. Depends on your preference ("I just can bear to see my 'lil Squirttle turn into a big smelly Wartortle" etc...)

- When you get the chance to swap a Spearow for a Far'Fetched called Dux in the city with the SS Anne docked there (Vermillion City); do it, Dux is so am the man.

- Anything with wrap must be good because that particular skill pisses me RIGHT OFF. *ahem*.

- Ratata's are worth having because they get a lethal lil attack later on and despite their inherent weak defence this makes them pha77. (Its HyperFang),

- The Day Care Center (Located to the left of the tunnel to the SS Anne City ie Route 6 from Saffron City) is excellent for training Cacoon Pokemon like Metapods which are completely useless untill they evolve. The Daycare center evolves them for ya!

- Nuggets are worth $5000. (aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh...)

Badges:
=======
Here is what all eight of the trainer badges do and what outside of combat skill they let you use in some cases.

Boulder		- Increases Attack + Lets you use FLASH
Cascade		- Pokemon up to Level 30 Obey + lets you use CUT
Thunder		- Increases Speed + Lets you use FLY
Rainbow		- Pokemon up to Level 50 Obey + Lets you use STRENGTH
Soul			- Increases Defence + Lets you use SURF
Marsh			- Pokemon up to Level 70 Obey
Volcano		- Increases Special
Earth			- All Pokemon will Obey


Mew:
====
Well I told you I could get ya Mew and I can, but you have to use the Game Shark codes in the Cheats section (Which might be cheating but hey, do it late in the game and pretend you got lucky!). 

'Tis the only way to get a Mew despite a million and one rumours. This is confirmed. THERE IS NO "Legit" WAY TO GET MEW! *ahem* Some stats for the rarest of the Rare are as follows.


Pokedex Entry:
--------------

Name: 	Mew
Type:	New Species
Poke:	Type 1 Pychic
HT  :	1'4"
WT  :	9.0lb
No. :	151

So rare that it is still said
to be a mirage by many experts.
Only a few people have seen it
worldwide.


Skills (In order that you get them):
------------------------------------

Pound: [Starts With It]
Effective in the extreme (Mew Starts with this skill). Once you reach level 20 this will kick the shit out of most things around, and should continue to do so as you progress though the game and onto harder opponents.

Transform: [Around Level 10]
Allows Pokemon to transform into its opponant. Great for testing out Pokemon you cant find/aint got yet. Trouble is, they are usually not as good as Mew!

Megapunch: [Around Level 19]
Absolutely lethal, if a little in-accurate to begin with. Keep trying, and soon Mew becomes almost impossible to beat in a single sitting.


If You Get Bored Ch34T:
=======================

To Turn Pokeball into ultra ball: While throwing a pokeball, repeatedly press up a down b up a down b and the pokeball should catch the pokemon (This seems to werk better on the gameboy, as opposed to an emulator; I dont know why).

To Make the S.S.Anne stay: Kill Your Arch Rival d00d (well, beat him, er, DEFEAT him), then go and find CUT, *then fight a trainer on the S.S.Anne and faint*. The S.S.Anne should now stay forever.
