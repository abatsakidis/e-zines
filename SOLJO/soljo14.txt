(llama) SKANK TO VICTORY - a parody
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Scene: It is a largish cell in a 1940`s German prisoner of war camp. Inside are Llama, Paris, Chicken Soup. In one corner is the band Madness, in another is Less than Jake. Llama is looking out of the window.)

(sounds of gunfire and general screams of death)

Llama: Well, it appears that DJ RobinB`s attempt to "trance to victory" has failed. Just as the music bored the guards to sleep, a passing German Oompah band woke them, and they were all shot trying to cross the fence.

Paris: Oh well, I tried to warn them.....

Llama: well, we have are own plan of escape, right guys?

All: Right!

Llama: Well, just for a handy timed recap (for all you guys back home). Chicken Soup, explain the plan. Again.

Chicken Soup: We set up a concert for the POW’s with our two ska bands, Madness and Less than Jake headlining. This attracts all the guards, at which point we can all escape. Are we all understood.

Less than Jake: yes, but why do Madness get to headline?

(Roger and Suggs start to fight)

Llama: Stop it guys!

(They both look sheepish)

Llama: Right, I’ll explain it again. Madness will headline, because of Suggs crimes against humanity.

Suggs: pardon?

Llama: two words: NIGHT FEVER. Justice will be done for allowing the channel 5 program to exist. Although because this is 1940`s Germany, it will never be made, because you would be dead, but then we weren’t born yet, so....... AAAAAGHHHHH!

Paris: Calm down Llama, forget about the temporal time breakdown. Ska wasn’t even being played yet.

Llama: Sorry. Anyway, everyone will escape while the mass skanking goes on, you guys in Madness, try to escape as well.

Madness: um, okay!

Llama: so, when have you scheduled the concert?

Chicken Soup: tonight!

Llama: That’s handy......



SCENE 2

(in the concert hall, Less than Jake have just finished playing. All the German guards have been attracted to the infectious beat of ska and ska punk, and they are all enjoying themselves)

Llama: Right, madness are up next, we all ready.

All (apart from Madness, naturally): yes

(Madness start to play)

Suggs (singing): Its just gone noon in the past moonsoon.....

Paris: Right, start skanking toward the exit!

(everyone starts to skank towards the exit)

Chicken Soup: Right, off we go!

(they all leave into the courtyard)

Llama: quick! towards the fence!

(Suddenly, a trio of guards appear)

Rammstein: Hey, stop!

Chicken Soup: Du Hast this!

(Chicken Soup pulls out a General Electric minigun, and turns Rammstein into red mist)

Paris: Jesus Chicken Soup! was that necessary?

Chicken Soup: Yes.

Llama: where did you keep it?

(Anyway, back to the concert hall!)

(all the guards look towards the exit)

Suggs: better distract them!

Suggs: Hey you, don’t watch that, watch this! This is the heavy heavy monster sound, the nuttiest sound around! So if you’ve come in off the street, and you’re beginning to feel the heat, well Buster you better start to move your feet, to the rockingest rock steady beat of Madness! ONE STEP BEEEEEEYOND!

(all the guards turn around and cheer)

(outside again, they have scaled the fence)

Paris: we’re free! everybody remember their German guard uniform and phrase book?

All: yes!

Llama (looking back): what’s that?

(in the distance, a large commotion is happening in the camp. Lets go have a better look)

Suggs: hey, good job I stole that motorcycle! with this I should be able to clear the fence using that handy ramp

(suggs guns the throttle, and drives up the ramp, and off the end)

Suggs: We’re not going to make it..... I knew I shouldn’t have let the rest of you tag along

the Rest of Madness: Thanks Suggs....

(the motorcycle explodes into a ball of flames, killing Madness)

Llama: well, at least Night Fever won`t be made now......

All (including suggs (ghost of) ): hooray!!!!

END.

(|PaRiS|) Editorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I look at this gay windows 98 machines clock in the gay taskbar... its 6.24 AM; llama, comrade and chicken soup have just left my house. I glance over to the slightly damaged absinthe bottle, the empty beer cans and the empty whisky bottle (yes I cained the rest Comrade ;). I turn the playstation off and note llama failed to beat my survivor record on tekken 3. I also notice we drank a quite expensive bottle of champagne; no matter it was good. I recall that Chicken Soup continually won at cards'; brag and poker mainly, but this is okay because it was only for match sticks (its a tradition).

I tidy up abit, discarding fag ends and glasses into their proper place, washing a few dishes in my drunken stat and put my coffee tables back where they belong and not in makeshift "casino" mode.

And why all this...? 

Because that’s what we do. 

We are SOL.

*I now have coffee* I don’t intend to sleep today (I have to stay in touch with my latest web design client), and seeing as I should really get this issue of soljo finished let us commence with my editorial. Yes I am back in SOL, and yes I am back editing the soljo (I was forced to come back by my conscience after reading the last piss-poor release... I was visited by three ghosts, all of whom said that llama was gay, one of whom has photographic evidence...). Alot has happened in SOL world since the last release, which incidentally failed to mention any SOL news at all (another llama innovation I have thankfully dispensed with...) but needless to say we are *still* keeping it real.

And needless to say that IRC is still full of lamers.

But we are still doing it hardcore.

And Cronus is still the man.

And Llama will never edit another soljo (as long as there is a breath in my body...)

And I rock your world.

Do I need to say more?

I think not.

Read on.

The soljo.

The only choice for the UK underground scene...

"You fucking right I did it."

======================================================================================

(|PaRiS|) Llama - The problems with the occult - Reply.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now it would appear that llama has a problem with the occult. He even admits that he has "always been quite sceptical about these sorts of things." And therein lay the essence of his problems, you see the thing the cynical and sceptical never understand is the very foundation of that which they hope to explore; the essence of magick is one simple thing, belief. And what’s a very strongly held belief, that’s right ladies and gentlemen, its faith.

It has been speculated by many philosophers, occult and otherwise (for the term occult is primarily a western term, because most so called "occult" belief's are practised as established religion and or cultural necessities on eastern parts of the world; such as astrology, feng shui and many other superstitious ritual systems.) that the three most important things in life are Love faith and trust (A triad, for those of you who even know what that means). *The* triad in many respects.

"Now, I'll take a look at this in a scientific sort of way" he says in his opening analytical paragraph; how can you take a look at faith scientifically? You cannot quantify what is not tangible. That’s like trying to use a scientific argument to explain the non existence of God against a evangelical minister; it wont make a blind bit of difference to his faith, can you not see the power in that VERY fact?

Despite all the scientific proof (for example, against the creation story in the bible), the minister will still have faith in his beliefs. Why is this? Because in his mind (and when entertaining any analysis of magick at all that’s where you MUST be) his faith supersedes actual scientific fact. That understood, you can begin to grasp upon the tip of an upside-down iceberg that is enlightenment.

What is real? What is reality? Do you really know? Is the outside real, our perception, or is the inside, the mind real, our understanding. Which part is more real? Or is it that they are real in equal proportions? Who knows, not me; but unlike scientists I am not so arrogant as to speculate that one (In scientists case; perception) is more important than the other. The mind has power too (take the opening example of faith and belief); its not a power you can measure in conventional terms, but it is there. 

"Everything in the universe needs energy for it to work. Right?. Okay. Now take a look at spellcasting..." Because you obviously know all about it. I hazard that you wouldn’t even know how to perform a spell, let alone be in a remote position to even speculate as to what energy drives it. However, we can use your theoretical (if ill thought out) template to explain how a spell ACTUALLY works.

You imagine the result you desire.
USING THE POWER OF YOUR MIND (The same "power" that fuels belief)
You can manipulate the world around you.

There is your power supply all explained (no matter how crude a notion it is to suggest that belief can be brought down to the level of the physical). The power that one can muster, is measured by the amount of belief (read faith) that one has in the spell its self, and is the main reason a sceptic will never see a result from magick of any kind.

"Familiars?" I’m glad you used the question mark because you clearly have no clue what they are... Familiars are in essence anything brought down to aid a magician of any sort in the practise of magick, usually in the form of a spirit (ie. a dead thing) or a demon or angel of some sort ("Holy Guardian Angels" etc) - are you now suggesting that there is no afterlife? And if so, scientifically prove it smart ass. And if you cant, you are on no higher ground that I, and in no better position to speculate, its just your word against mine. The very essence of a scientific argument? lol.

Science - The art of the already understood.
Occult  - The art of the yet to be explained.

Tell me I’m wrong; a scientist was once nailed to a tree for claiming the earth was round, the thought was deemed occult by the christian church. Scientific persecution of that which even IT cannot understand is no better morally, they should learn from the mistakes of history; not repeat them.

"The creation of something out of nothing (well, more than oxygen, nitrogen and some noble gases)." When does magick ever claim to have made something from nothing? (outside the sci fi fantasy books you hold so dear) Its all about Quantum Physics (Chaos Magick) - in short, relocation of matter, its not about "Bling" there is a new tree i just made. Even vulgar magick is not about that, magick CAN be used as a catalyst to otherwise scientifically explainable events - example using the power of one's belief to speed up the movement between molecules to create fire (All theoretically possible if one truly believed they could achieve it).

It should be noted that 90% of famous mages were also notorious madmen, usually prone to delusions; who better to believe in themselves enough to perform magical acts? (given the template for power of mind = magick laid out above).

"A spell which affects the outcome of the future?" If one can guess that a stone in a road will cause a car crash, a crash which they WANTED to cause, and then arranges matters so that a stone somehow ends up in that road (without ever actually moving it there themselves) then that IS a spell, and that is effecting the outcome of the future. That’s how small it can be. You are simply defining the very basic concept of cause and effect, quite a large degree of magick is just an extension of cause and effect. Are you suggesting that that scientific theory is wrong?? In your own words "Pull the other one".

"Ability to look into the future? hahah." So you know how time works do you? Einstein couldn’t quite quantify it but you can? Quote: "hahah". If time is forever expanding, then contracting... ie going forward till the end of time, and then backwards to the beginning only to repeat the cycle (If you believe in fate you should more or less agree with this theory, one of thousands on the nature of time which Llama has so arrogantly assumed he knows the nature of) then prey tell me why it would be impossible to remember forwards, as well as backwards? I’m not saying that that’s the case. I’m saying you CANNOT scientifically prove otherwise. Therefore your argument (Based on science) is flawed, its unprovable, you like everyone else on the planet cannot speculate, so how can you assume that its impossible?

"It would also mean that your future has already been predetermined." Can you scientifically prove that it hasn’t? "What an awful thing!" yeah life’s a bitch. "You would have no control over your own destiny." Not true. Just because the outcome would always be the same, that is no indication on what a persons mind would be thinking. You would be making choices and decisions, just the same one's you made before, and what’s wrong with that? Personalities would choose the same options given identical variables time and time again. That’s just the human mind for you. Its all beginning to look far more possible now isnt it.

"Having an effect on somebody’s mind? A mystical energy (lets call it ooh, magicon. Yeah!) affects the brain pathways, disrupting the electrical signals passing between the nerve cells." Your right, you have been playing warhammer too much. Effecting somebody’s mind is no more difficult that having all your pints bought for you all the time (ring any bells?), think small, that’s the point. Its not force its subtle manipulation and barter (of sorts).

"The brain is an amazing organ, but that powerful? no." So you unlike all the great biologists of the human race ACTUALLY understand what the 90% of the human brain we can’t account for does? Your so cool. *Yawn*.

"Here is another point: If witchcraft and spells, or psychic powers really did exist, why are we not all doing them today?" There are many, many reasons for this, the most important being if you don’t have faith in it it wont work, and the second most important being that due to persecution from the Christian church in the so called "Dark Ages" right up to present day the very term Witch and Wicca are deemed as negative, and given negative images, as is the very term "Magic" deemed as "Satan’s" work. Do not under estimate just how much impact Christian propaganda and dogma has had on our society (Despite the fact that according to the bible three mages visited christ when he was born along with the shepherds and kings, the word mage or "Magi" was translated to "Wise Man" but that’s not actually what it means. It means just what it says. Mage.)

"After all, these are fantastic things, being able to heal with a touch, or move objects without touching them, how about influencing another persons mind? Clearly, if we could, we would." And you never will. Gutted yet?

"Now, I’m going to keep this short. Naturally, I’m going to get a bit of uh, stick from some people, who clearly feel that all of these things exist. Well, I say prove it. Bring on the evil death spells, eh? ;) I’ll see how I can attempt to debunk it. If I can’t, well, I’m a believer." One cannot harm another with magic, its goes against the golden rules of the law of three fold (a karmic thing in which whatever you do to another has to be expected back three times). Not all practitioners of magic stick to this rule, but all know of it.

So in conclusion... Faith is the energy of Magic. Disprove Faith, it cannot be proved or disproved, as previously mentioned science is the art of the already explained. That’s why magic is not part of it, because it is fuelled by a non tangible power supply. Llama, it has been proved above knows little about science let alone magic and was in no position to debunk anything at all in the first place.

You cannot prove magick. We all know the old "With proof faith cannot exist" statement, so its an argument I cannot loose (nor win). I just hope you have some better understanding of the concepts you wish to debunk now. Or, any at all. And if you were to need any proof; i still remember your gob smacked look when I did your tarot cards and revealed lots of things you had not told me. Ahh... the mundane mind easily forgets, and falls fast asleep once more.

If you don’t understand it, you never will, and frankly, that’s fine by us.

(Cronus) Hackers At Large 2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hackers At Large 2001 [www.hal2001.org] 

Arriving at the University of Twente the day before the start of HAL 2001
all I can see before me is a vast plain of tents and a jungle of Cat5 cable
and power cords. My only business at the campus was to register for the con
which was to start bright and early (10.30am) on Friday. While trying to
register it becomes brutally clear that Europeans really don't understand the
concept of the humble queue, so I roll up my sleeves and muscle my way to a
cashier. I purquire a stylish green wrist band which clearly isn't meant to
be removed till the end of the 3 day conference and go on a small expedition
to familiarise myself with the layout of the campus. Stomach grumbles and I
turn to head back to my warm and comfortable hotel, smiling gleefully each
time I pass a tent.

But don't get me wrong - most of these tents were serious affairs. I could
easily see myself getting lost in many of the tents I see strewn across
the many fields. What sticks in my mind most of all is the Swiss Telco tent
that’s been converted to resemble the server room of a large ISP. The amount
of electrical energy needed to power one of these tents... well lets just
say, I'm not sure you could find a novelty charity cheque big enough to pay 
the bill.

Friday morning I arrive on the campus unsure of when and what talks were 
planned. A quick beer for breakfast and I headed off to find someone who
knew more than me (no jokes thank you) about the con. A schedule of the
day mentions a talk on Secure Programming Libraries which I head to. The
speaker never turned up for the talk itself, but I was rewarded (?) by
having John Draper (aka Captain Krunch) sit next to me. For those in the
audience who know nothing of hack/phreak history, Captain Krunch was one
of the earliest phone phreaks in the States. Story has it he was able to
generate tones that manipulated the phone network with a plastic whistle
that came free with a box of Captain Krunch cereal. Any clearer now Ark ?!?

John Draper begins to explain, once I had recognised him, that he has had
to go to the last two Defcons in disguise because the Cult of the Dead Cow
were 'after him'. Further questioning reveals that 'after him' means 
attempting to take compromising pictures of John with an underage boy
in a hotel room doing some sort of 'exercises'. All I can say is that I
drew allot of strange stares when I broke into uncontrollable laughter.
John promptly stood and left the auditorium. 

A few talks came next, none of which could be considered note-worthy. But
before all hope was lost Paul Wouters toke to the stage to talk about 
Transportation of Intercepted IP Traffic, which was violently eye-opening.
I thought going to Hal, I might not completely understand every talk but
I would at least understand the concept. It turned out that the Dutch
Authority have published a specification on wiretapping of potential
criminal internet connections. I have little doubt that most governments
have been able to and actually tapping net connections, but to outright
stand up and say (i) this is how we do it, (ii) we want your help to 
improve the security of it and (iii) we expect ISPs to pay for it, is
maddening. 

Introduction to IPv6 was fascinating because appart from hearing about 
the new spec I had never actually learnt anything about it. Walter Bergers 
and Pim van Pelt walked us through the difference between version 4 and 
version 6. And also provided us with information on how to get our own 
hands dirty by playing with the network spec that is just round the corner.

Back at my hotel for the night I realised that any Hal related people
staying in my hotel were likely to be speakers or organisers. Perhaps
now would be a good time to mention that the con was held in the middle
of nowhere. A train ride, a taxi, 2 camels and 15km of hiking from the
airport. It was actually my idea to group together a few of the tables
of speakers, organisers and visitors in the hotel bar to get a decent
discussion going. Fifteen minutes later I was in my room watching dutch
TV having realised the topics under debate were *way* above my understanding.

Saturday started with a discussion of FreeBSD Kernel Modules by the raven
haired visage that was Stephanie Wehner. I had read many articles on 
abusing kernel modules on different OSs but this talk actually kept me awake. 
While covering the programming aspects she also found time to mention the 
uniqueness of the FreeBSD kernel and its own intriquacies.

I had been planning to have a beer for lunch but I had the pleasure of being
recognised by Ignis whom I knew was going to Hal and who I had tried in vain
to call after arriving in Holland. Ignis, Ark, Madboar and Mordeth were all
there. None fit the images I had for them in my mind, but that was to be
expected I suppose. I was quick to point out to Boar when I saw him that he
still owed me a pint which he promised to repay. All wells so far...

I went to lunch with Ignis and Ark. And while they fetched food I found a
table to sit at, which turned out to already be inhabited by FT, surprise
surprise. No points for guessing that he didn't look or act as I'd expected.
And in good ol' traditional FT fashion, he dodged any question no matter how
vague about himself. 

cronus: Do you work or are you in college ?
FT: Part time.
cronus: influence.org is yours isn't it ? 
FT: *faint nod*
cronus: Whats the bandwidth ?
FT: Enough.
cronus: You are FT aren't you ?!?
FT: Eh... Listen maybe I'll cya later...

An exageration granted but point making I think. Over lunch I realised 
that myself and Ignis worked as Admins for competing companies in Dublin.
Many questions followed about the others office and the equipment they
contained. 

Ignis, Ark and I trundled off to see the Daily Security Practices of an 
ISP presented by Scott McIntyre. Both informative and vaguely humourous, 
despite his prediliction to glare at anyone in the audience under 30 
everytime he said the word hacker.

It was roughly at this stage that Boar offered me a drag of a spliff.
Which was to be my first and last taste of anything even remotely
interesting over the weekend. Last talk before I grabbed dinner at my
swanky hotel was on the topic of DNSsec which is a cypto-secured DNS
protocol - something I had never heard of before the con but an obvious
combination of two schools of thought. I gather from the looks from
Boar and Ignis that I am not the only person lost after the talk moved
into cryptographic signigures, keys, hashes, parental certs, child
certs and other cyrpto jargon. One point of the talk was quite odd, 
but admittedly I may not have grasped it fully. It seems that under
the proposed alternative to traditional DNS, once everyone has accepted
the validity of your domain you can never revoke it. Its the truly
stateful protocol. Scary to say the least.

The Hackers Choice hosted a Hacker Quiz last thing that night which 
was quite humorous. I am surprised by answers I know and ashamed at
the questions I should be able to answer. The #hack.se team clean up
even correcting the self-proclaimed Question Master a few times which
brought cheers from the audience and spits from the gods. 

It just occurred to me that I lost a talk on SSH vulnerabilities given
by Dug Song and Solar Designer which was fantastic. Guessing the length
of a password by sniffing the encrypted packets, determining the success
or failure of a login attempt and most notably the future possibility
of correlating inter-packet timing with key strokes. 

Also worthy of mention was Emmanueal Goldstein's (2600 editor and chief)
key-note speech. A full on attack of Corporation Mental, which I didn't
agree with but I was well amused by his unabrased attack. He also presented
a film detailing the Kevin Mitnick ordeal from the point of view of well-
known hackers and general scene whores. I've read the articles, the books,
seen the film and now I saw the 'real' story... *pause for laugther* Its
amazing how both sides are quick to point out the propaganda used by the
other, but ignore their own. John Markoff (of the NY Times who has written
extensively on the topic) was, unknowingly, put through a test of his
journalistic integrity and, unsurprisingly, lost. But it was a close call
right to the final hurdle. 

I'm sure I've left out huge chunks of the con, but I suppose some things
have to be seen to be believed. I will never go to a con where I can't
legally drink (see Defcon), I will never camp at a con (or anywhere for 
that matter) and I will also go on the company expense account... Muahaha !

Ps. Madboar still owes me a pint... Some debts will never be repayed...

[An interview with Keydet79, infamous for his site defacements and various other things. 
Do a search on www.google.com for more details on his underground activities... The Interview
covers hacking ethics and political issues (relating to his native Russia). Read on...]

Session Start: Fri Aug 31 20:39:59 2001
Query with keyDet79 (~ussr@194.134.210.XXX)
Common channels: .#moo
-
( |PaRiS| ) hello :)
( keyDet79 ) yo
( keyDet79 ) hm..starship troopers starts in 15 minutes...
( |PaRiS| ) Lets go then...
( |PaRiS| ) Do you consider yourself a blackhat hacker a whitehat hacker or is all that stuff just bullshit, and if so why?
( keyDet79 ) uhm
( keyDet79 ) pff
( keyDet79 ) let me think for a sec
( |PaRiS| ) np
( keyDet79 ) well i think only a whitehat hacker is truly a hacker..
( keyDet79 ) since he loves the technology, the computer security
( keyDet79 ) that love comes after years and years of experience
( keyDet79 ) people that use the technology for mallicious things dont have that
( keyDet79 ) how ya spell mallicious anyway ;/
( |PaRiS| ) hehe
( |PaRiS| ) dont worry
( |PaRiS| ) ;)
( keyDet79 ) i think im a blackhat hacker
( keyDet79 ) since i use them to gain money for me
( keyDet79 ) next ;/
( |PaRiS| ) hehehe
( |PaRiS| ) okay... do you think eastern europe is home to more talented users than the rest of the world?
( |PaRiS| ) and if so, for what reason.
( keyDet79 ) well
( keyDet79 ) europeans are better educated
( keyDet79 ) its a fact
( keyDet79 ) they speak more languages..
( keyDet79 ) there are a lot of european people working for american firms here in europe, as well as in the usa
( keyDet79 ) but..
( keyDet79 ) eastern europe?
( keyDet79 ) heh
( |PaRiS| ) former soviet states for example...
( keyDet79 ) actually, there are far too few people with a computer degree there
( keyDet79 ) russia doesnt have enough of them
( keyDet79 ) i dunno dude..
( keyDet79 ) damn ur asking tough questions
( keyDet79 ) hmm
( |PaRiS| ) it just seems much of the warez we see, the quality stuff originates in eastern europe...
( |PaRiS| ) :)
( keyDet79 ) no i dont think so
( |PaRiS| ) where do you think the quality warez come from in that case?
( keyDet79 ) yes but thats because warez are pretty much legal there
( keyDet79 ) those countries have enough problems as it is
( keyDet79 ) and they dont give a shit bout warez
( |PaRiS| ) thats understandable...
( |PaRiS| ) :)
( |PaRiS| ) would you ever "hack" for your government? or any government? would it be a matter of politics or money? :)
( keyDet79 ) just money
( keyDet79 ) there is no government here ;/ theres only internet
( keyDet79 ) so i wouldnt care
( keyDet79 ) if someone would pay me to exploit a specific server or company for money, id do it
( |PaRiS| ) you believe the government has lost control totally in russia?
( keyDet79 ) yeh i do
( keyDet79 ) its anarchy, no democracy
( keyDet79 ) polititions drive ferraris, have boats of a billion dollars..
( |PaRiS| ) do you think the united states is to blame for that, one way or the other?
( keyDet79 ) no i dont think its the usa's fault
( keyDet79 ) why would it be
( keyDet79 ) it were 2 seperate powers
( keyDet79 ) i dont expect them to help out russia
( |PaRiS| ) ( keyDet79 ) polititions drive ferraris, have boats of a billion dollars.. <-- thats the same in the west unfortunately...
( keyDet79 ) no it isnt..
( keyDet79 ) well in the west people earn more
( keyDet79 ) in russia, poland, 100$ is a normal salary
( keyDet79 ) but.. the polititions earn as much as in the usa
( keyDet79 ) its not right
( keyDet79 ) they are all corrupt ;)
( |PaRiS| ) who do you think is to blame for "The fall of russia" if the US isnt?
( keyDet79 ) comunism
( keyDet79 ) people just got tired of it
( |PaRiS| ) it doesnt work then? :)
( keyDet79 ) not being able to start your own company for example
( keyDet79 ) or not being able to carry around more than 50 american dollars
( keyDet79 ) i think it works for countries like colombia, china
( keyDet79 ) they have always been poor..
( keyDet79 ) russia hasnt
! |PaRiS| nods.
( |PaRiS| ) okay... back to you... do you have an ambitions related to your technical talents?
( keyDet79 ) no actually i dont ;/
( keyDet79 ) its not a technical talent..
( keyDet79 ) its just a love for my hobby
( keyDet79 ) and i love it too much
( |PaRiS| ) in an world where you didnt have to worry about the rent... would you say your in it for the love or the money?
( keyDet79 ) the love of course
( keyDet79 ) the money is just a part of it
( keyDet79 ) i get a kick out of it, out of making money my way
( keyDet79 ) in a way not many people can ;)
( |PaRiS| ) do you consider yourself notorious?
( |PaRiS| ) a search on google about you comes up with alot of stuff :)
( keyDet79 ) uhm
( keyDet79 ) i guess so, im pretty famous
( keyDet79 ) but that doesnt mean im any better than jack smith the computer programmer ;)
( keyDet79 ) or something
( keyDet79 ) i get a kick out of it
( keyDet79 ) out of reading about myself
( |PaRiS| ) do you have issues with windows as an operating system?
( keyDet79 ) well actually, and most people will disagree..
( keyDet79 ) i find windows more secure than unix systems
( keyDet79 ) its not open source..
( keyDet79 ) thats good when it comes to security
( |PaRiS| ) there are always gonna be security issues with systems built for sharing like UNIX...
( keyDet79 ) there are no wicked wu buffer overflow sploits for it by example
( |PaRiS| ) do you think microsoft are as sinister as everyone thinks?
( keyDet79 ) people just cant fuck around in the source code lookin for mistakes
( keyDet79 ) heh
( keyDet79 ) microsoft
( keyDet79 ) i like microsoft products
( keyDet79 ) uhm
( keyDet79 ) i dont like microsoft cuz its the richest company in the world..
( |PaRiS| ) amen :) heh...
( keyDet79 ) but if it wasnt for microsoft
( keyDet79 ) many of us wouldnt be here on the internet right now
! |PaRiS| nods.
( |PaRiS| ) is there anything else you would like to say?
( |PaRiS| ) :)
( keyDet79 ) yeh, ur questions suck dude ;/
( keyDet79 ) they make me think

=========================================================================================

(Comrade) Brief analysis of some issues involving the use of IRC...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am going to attempt a brief analysis of some issues involving the use
of irc and the relatively recent advent of electronic communication.
This is a difficult area to research so my ideas are mainly based on my
personal experience. Firstly I always find it useful to consider man as 
a product of evolution in an environment increasing unfamiliar to our own 
in modern society. Indeed it's thankfully common knowledge that civilisation
itself is but a film on the history of man, who for millions of years
pursued that clichéd hunter gather approach to living, killing animals
or finding wildly growing plants for sustenance, frequently changing
location (nomadic) and thus obtaining a very wide ranging diet. Socially
I understand this pre-civilised lifestyle required living in small
groups, what with the obviously sparse population and limited contact
with any other people. Enjoying myself on this tangent, what we should
also come to recognise is the social conventions that built up with the
coming of civilisation since these conventions that are not all entirely
compatible with the modern electronic environment that has suddenly 
mobilised.

Instinct dictates a sociable approach to living for obvious reasons, and
the use of the Internet for direct forms of communication like e-mail
and irc (or any kind of chatroom) were inevitably one of it's most
popular utilisations. The web didn't come along until a fair bit later;
people were chatting on bbs' and trading warez before that 'information
resource' in the form of a commercial enterprise grew popular. E-mail is
all well and good for having a personal or group discussion but irc is
real time chat - a far closer approximation to real life which comes 
cheap and easy to so many teenagers today especially in the US. A 
limited popularity with people in middle age upwards is mainly due to 
the young age and recent popularity of the technology. Time will only 
tell if you're going to be loading mirc when you're beginning to feel 
the effects of all those cigarettes and loosing your teeth as much as 
you do now but I suspect you won't, and I'll try to demonstrate why. The
coming of the telephone was the one of the few times technology really
made an impact on the way people communicate, but it's the first step 
backwards in a respect - you can no longer see the person you're talking
to. Body language and facial expressions are an important part of 
communication of course but conversation on the phone can still be quite
intimate; you can hear variations in tone of voice and audible 
expressions etc. It's worth considering telephony has only really ever
involved two parties though, the communication is always formal to a
degree because you're unlikely to phone someone and 'idle' ;)

IRC was the next step with a difference. Linked servers mean any number
of people can potentially chat in channels or privately for long periods
of time without necessarily running up a phone bill (I'm not about to 
forget the days when we did), but now there's another step backward - 
you can't even hear this person anymore. It's all text based and the 
establishment of emoticons are a personal but poor substitute to make up
for 'real life' communication. It's a unique environment everyone likely
to be reading this knows about; no-one is going to be prejudiced about
the way you look, sound or how you're dressed when you first start 
talking to them and because of the immense size and dynamic nature of 
the online user base you're unlikely to have heard about someone before
you start talking to them either. Although established channels on irc
make up for that a little, there's nothing on icq or any of it's 
derivatives I know of that do practically. Upon meeting a relationship
of some form might develop, but they will take forms not entirely 
analogous to 'real life'. You might run into one person every day when
this would have been unlikely outside school/work and this time you can
choose exactly where you go, leaving one place and never coming back 
with no more trouble than a few keystrokes.

A potential problem can occur if you become acquainted well enough with
someone irc you can of course get to know one another only so well. This
is not especially significant in itself but what happens if someone 
begins to idle in #xyz when they could be out 'getting a life' with some
real people. The Internet might be an interesting way of meeting people;
I met the sol krew irl a while back and never looked back, but you can
spend a very long time online without realising it. The longer you do 
that, the longer this artificial environment becomes your reality where
ops, ircops and network admin really are significant figures of 
authority and war scripts affect your normal socialising patterns. 
People get worked up with events on irc, and others get worked up 
because they do, bringing us back to the get a life argument. It's all
well and good trying to do a reality check but these people (often 
ircops for example) may fail to appreciate that irc is becoming their 
users reality or at least a part of it. It might be fair comment 
advising anyone to take the whole thing with a pinch of salt but until
you've taken that transcendal leap into real life you're left to stew in
your own emoticons and *actions*.

Mobile phones have a slant on things as well nowadays given the 
widespread use of text messaging. The relationship may be more complete
(or traditional perhaps), you might know the person for real and texting
offers a non-confrontational alternative. That explains the particular
popularity between young people and kids but now comes the crux of my 
argument. What might have otherwise been said in real life might just 
find itself packaged into 160 characters and a few irritating electronic
beeps. You can dismiss that pretty quickly as irrelevant but in my own
experience the worst decision i ever remember making was trying to put
something into a text i should have said face to face; i was replying to
another message, natch. Sour grapes maybe, I cannot deny it's a 
revolution of sorts given the accessibility and convenience. Things may
change as the technology improves to allow streaming video to be sent 
online and from portable devices cheaply, but ask yourself why do people
text when they could phone? To come back my apparently unrelated 
introduction ;) people aren't yet used to dealing with this kind of 
correspondence and therefore relationships within our current 
traditional social framework and established ideals. Things may have 
been changing a lot over the 20th century but this change has come about
quicker still and as I write, I can't predict exactly where it's going
to lead us. I've become more general than I originally intended to but
that demonstrates this is an issue of global and historic proportions
and SoL are right in the middle of it.

(Cronus) FreeBSD Networking - part I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-(introduction) 
After a recent bout with FreeBSD 4.2 networking I decided it was worth my time to actually 
record what I'd learnt. As time goes on it seems that the simpler the topic the more FAQs, 
tutorials and How-To's exist. Any topic that is even slightly above the heads of the masses 
is ignored other than in esoteric hardcopy manuals. I'm going to try to broaden the number 
of articles on slightly more technical topics. On a side note - allot of the information contained 
here will carry across to other *nix environments - mainly those with networking code derived 
from bsd code. 

-(hardware) 
A Network Interface Card slots into an expansion slot at the back of a computer allowing it 
to connect to an ethernet using bog standard Cat 5 (category 5) cable. The NIC is also called 
a network card, an ethernet card or an Interface. Interface is the term used by the man pages 
and the How-To's. And its the term I'll be using. 

-(interfaces) 
The installation script will give you the ability to configure any interfaces you have on your 
machine. This GUI makes the process simpler than command line setup but you need to 
understand the terminology before you can set it up to work. That you will need to learn 
elsewhere - if I remember I will add resource links at the end... 

ifconfig is the tool used to configure the interfaces installed in the machine. Entering ifconfig 
without any command line arguments will simply give you a list of the interfaces that are 
installed. Heres an example; 

www# ifconfig 
fxp0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 
inet 172.87.23.170 netmask 0xfffffff8 broadcast 172.87.23.175

I removed some columns and rows that aren't applicable to this article. The first section of 
information relates to the interface named as fxp0. The next section of information relates 
to the interface named as fxp1. The naming scheme for interface cards is determined by the 
manufacturer. So whereas mine as listed fxp0 and fxp1 you may have interfaces named as 
eth0 and eth1, its not important. The computer from which I've taken this examples has 
two network interface cards which is unusual but the reasons will become obvious later on. 

The first line of information about the interface named fxp0 states that the interface is UP 
and RUNNING and can handle BROADCAST and MULTICAST data. An interface can be 
brought up or down with the simple ifconfig command like so; 

www# ifconfig fxp0 down 
www# ifconfig fxp0 up 

If you bring and interface 'up' without any command line parameters its brought up using 
the settings it run under last time. Alternatively you can bring up an interface while also 
specifying your own parameters. While we're on the topic, you should remember you must 
bring down an interface before you can reset its IP address or netmask. 

www# ifconfig fxp0 172.87.23.170 netmask 255.255.255.0 

The above command would bring up the interface using the IP address 172.87.23.170 and 
a netmask of 255.255.255.0 - if you don't completely follow IP addressing and subnetting 
there are some resources at the end of the document you should read first. 

Going back to our example. The next lines tells us that the interface is listening on the 
IP address 172.87.23.170 with a netmask of 255.255.255.248 (represented here in hex: 
0xfffffff8) and using a broadcast address of 172.87.23.175 - which is driven from the IP 
address and the netmask. Oddly this interface seems to be listening on two IP addresses 
both 172.87.23.170 and 172.87.23.171. But the 171 IP address is simply an alias. The 
command that follows creates this alias with an IP of 172.87.23.171 using a netmask 
of 255.255.255.0 (represented as 0xffffff00). 

www# ifconfig fxp0 alias 172.87.23.171 netmask 255.255.255.0 

The line that begins 'ether' shows the MAC address of the network interface card. This 
address is a unique one given to all NICs at the time of manufacture. No two NICs in 
the world have the same MAC address. If you look at the example you will see that 
the two interfaces that this machine contains are seperated only by one bit. The line 
detailing 'media' shows that the interface is connected to an active ethernet cable 
capable of 10baseT data transmission. Finally the last line of the section gives us 
details of what media is supported by the interface. 

The interface named fxp1 is detailed in the next section. And its details are just as 
easy to interpret, with one exception. The first line of the fxp1 section states that 
the interface is UP and RUNNING and also that the interface is PROMISC. This 
flag means that the interface is running in promiscous mode and will read any packets 
of information on the network whether they were destined for the interface or not. 
The machine is running a program called Snort <" target=t21Linkhttp://www.snort.org/> 
</bti/redirect.html?http://www.snort.org/> which 'sniffs' 
every packet of information on the network looking for attacks against the network's 
computers. Any program that runs as a sniffer will need to turn on this promiscous 
mode flag in order to evesdrop on the network's traffic. 

There seems to be three more interfaces setup on the machine. ppp0, sl0 and lo0. 
ppp0 is the interface that would be used if the machine was connected to a modem 
and had dialed up its internet connection. Specifically the ppp0 interface is used for 
Point-to-Point Protocol connections. sl0 is the interface used for SLIP connections 
which are similar to PPP connections. 

lo0 is an interesting interface. Called the loopback interface it is the interface used 
when a user or a program tries to initiate a network connection with the same machine. 
Used by certain software daemons and testing procedures the loopback interface 
catches any packets of information addressed for the machine and processes it 
locally. The section specifies the IP address of the lo0 interface as 127.0.0.1 which 
is the IP used for loopback interfaces on all modern operating systems to my knowledge. 

-(networks) 

The netstat command is used under FreeBSD to list the network connections and 
routing table. To view the list of configured network interfaces use the following 
command; 

www# netstat -in 
Name Mtu Network Address 
fxp0 1500 <Link#1> 00:02:b3:3f:3a:b2 
fxp0 1500 217.78.6.168/ 217.78.6.170 
fxp0 1500 217.78.6 217.78.6.171 
fxp1 1500 <Link#2> 00:02:b3:3f:3a:b3 
fxp1 1500 192.168.1 192.168.1.100 
ppp0* 1500 <Link#3> 
sl0* 552 <Link#4> 
lo0 16384 <Link#10> 
lo0 16384 127 127.0.0.1 

I've removed some of the columns and rows that are not relevent. The interface 
name is listed in the first column which refers back to the output of the ipconfig 
command. MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit (I fink) which defines 
the latest size of data packets sent using each interface. 1500 is the ethernet 
standard and because of that, is cross platform. An interesting point of note is 
that the MTU of the loopback interface (lo0) is very high, this is because the 
data never actually leaves your machine - it is simply processed by the kernel. 

The routing table defines the route that needs to be taken for packets for 
different hosts or networks. To display the network routing table, we again 
use the netstat command like this; 

www# netstat -rn 
Routing tables 

Internet: 
Destination Gateway Flags Netif 
default 217.78.6.169 UGSc fxp0 
127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 UH lo0 
192.168.1.0 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff UHLWb fxp1 
192.168.1 link#2 UCc fxp1 
192.168.1.4 0:50:e4:50:c5:73 UHLW fxp1 
192.168.1.255 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff UHLWb fxp1 
217.78.6 link#1 UCc fxp0 
217.78.6.168/29 link#1 UCc fxp0 
217.78.6.169 0:0:c:e5:6d:78 UHLW fxp0 
217.78.6.175 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff UHLWb fxp0 

Surprisingly, yet again I have removed columns and rows that aren't needed. In 
particular I have removed IPv6 entries because that is an entire article on its own. 
Destination species the host or network which the route applies to. Default is 
a magical route that all packets are sent to when no other route is known. Again 
you'll remember that the host 127.0.0.1 is the machine itself, its the loopback 
address. Netif is shorthand for network interface and species which interface 
the route needs to take to reach the destination. 

The flags break down like this; U stands for UP and running as far as the kernel 
knows. G stands for gateway, I will get back to this, H stands for host, C stands 
for network, b stands for broadcast address. 

The gateway keyword is used to define the next host in the route to any destination. 
If the gateway host is only one 'hop' (on the same wire) then the routing table will 
contain an entry for it listing its MAC address as in 217.78.6.169 whos MAC 
address is 0:0:c:e5:6d:78. Note that all the broadcast addresses are listed with 
the same MAC address, but this is an address imply to show that they are not 
actual network interfaces. 

Routes are added and removed dynamically by the kernel as they become known 
or expire. But you can also modify them to suit your needs. You would use the 
follow command to add the entry for an IP address outside your local network; 

www# route add -host 66.70.14.70 default dev fxp0 

Add a route to the host 66.70.14.70 using the default gateway on the interface fxp0. 
The keyword 'add' can be replaced with 'delete' to remove an entry from the table. 
'-host' can be replaced with '-net' to add an entry to a network rather than a host. 

Stay tuned for part II when I will write about NATd, ipfw and setting up your FreeBSD 
machine as a gateway or a bridge.

What is love? 

Does anyone know?

A beautiful white dove? 

A deathly looking crow?

 

A flower that grows, bright and strong?

A weeping willow, whose death is so long?

 

The gentle caressing,

touch of a hand.

The sudden strike, 

sending me to the sand.

 

Warmth of a golden,

radiant sun.

Stabbing pain,

shots from a gun.

 

Blinded by love,

we all seem to be.

Have we forgotten,

what is reality?

 

For all of this,

love means to me.

However, now,

sugar-coated it seems to be.

 

Face the light,

for all that is real.

Accept what's in sight,

this is the deal.

 

Love is not perfect,

neither are we.

But do not neglect,

it can be great, you'll see.

 

With all the good times,

come the bad.

So please do not fear, 

it shall pass..this strange old fad...

(SOL) Radio 1 and its crimes against the underground.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IRC channel #Radio1 and its affiliated website www.radio1.org have always been a bit of an issue with SOL, mainly because many of #Radio1's original users came from the channel which sol more or less began its IRC related enterprises on, that being #amirc on DALnet. Thus many of the SOL members around at the time of SOL's "Reformation" in '98 were friends with the original #Radio1 users and founders who are now known as either senior users or the "Admin" of the channel its self. Amazed by the hierarchical irc channel shit? You would be, but we're not even gonna go there, where we are going to go is by pointing out exactly what we think that #Radio1 has done wrong.

The whole point of this is thus: The people in radio1, who more importantly, those who founded it, KNOW what IRC should be like and how people should be treated (lamers with contempt, etc), however, they seem to lack the notion of ethical responsibility in alot of cases to act as they know they should. And another reason, which is admittedly abit of a SOL gripe, channels like #radio1 encourage more lamers on IRC. And that is something we can ALL do without.


THE ACCUSED:
============

DJ Robin B:
-----------
Charge 1: Stealing the original "Fun" concept of Radio 1 from his friend comunion and exploiting it to gain free entry to various dance events, and other similar fringe benefits from Dave Pearce after contacting him independently and explaining the concept of an IRC channel to him.

Charge 2: Pasting private conversations to female IRC users in order to gain their favour, and more worryingly decrease that of others. This has probably occurred more than once, but in specific instances it was to someone who regarded him as a "close" IRC friend.

Charge 3: Choosing to ignore channel politics totally, leaving the channel he stole to the dogs after he has used it for everything he see's it as worth, yet still maintaining a kind of executive control where he seems to care little for the efforts of others made in his name, or the users of the channel in general.

Matty B:
--------
Charge 1: Pasting private conversations to female IRC users in order to gain their favour, and more worryingly decrease that of others. This has probably occurred more than once.

PaRiS:
------
Charge 1: Involving SOL with the channel #radio1 in a vain hope to change it.


EPSiLON:
--------
Charge 1: Choosing channel politics and "power" over friendship.


Sterri:
-------
Charge 1: Holding Green Eyed Grudges.


DJ-Evil:
--------
Charge 1: Claiming to be "Into" the warez scene, and mocking others for not being in his so called "Warez" circles when the only thing he truley pirates is MP3's, when frankly, any moron can do that with Napster or other such file sharing programs. And Im sure your benefactors at Radio One would LOVE to hear all about your Warez antics in their sponsored channel, we wondered, so we have to logs ready for emailing to dave.pearce@bbc.co.uk, what do you think Evil?

Charge 2: Turning into the type of user he claimed to be persecuted by the instant he was given operator status.

Charge 3: Pleading he didn’t know any better. The last refuge of a true lamer.


What Now?
==========

As for the channel and the principles it stands for? Well... We have been there already, and despite the best efforts of SOL over the last year to try and do something to Radio1 from within to make it a better place, it has only gotten worse. Read SOLJO 4 for our opinions. We shant state them again. For us, Radio1 is history; another example of the sad demise of the internet into commercial hell.


Other Interesting Radio1 facts...
=================================

- On the www.radio1.org website it is claimed that the radio1.org site and the chatroom #radio1 are UNOFFICIAL and in no way connected to radio 1, however the chatroom (in the topic at time of writting and in attitudes) claims it is the official "Dance Anthems" and or Radio 1 chatroom. Which claim is wrong? And if its, as we suspect, the chatroom making false claims, shouldn’t the BBC be informed?

1. EXT - DAY - Highstreet.

A busy town centre highstreet. The street is lined with shops and restaurants. People move from shop to shop. A group of people sit outside a coffee shop smoking and sipping from their overlarge cups. Amongst it all a man stands facing a restaurant, looking up at the sign. He turns and we can see his face. He is grey haired and middle aged. His eyes are piercing blue. He wears a sharp grey suit with an open shirt collar.

MR SUIT

Why are restaurants so expensive? Isn't it one of our natural rights to eat? Its one of those basic things to be allowed to eat and drink, sleep, breath. When we are deprived of these we die. Or go mad. Or both.

Someone walks past MR SUIT.

MR SUIT

So why pay out for something we grow in the garden or keep in the pond? Take a look at the menu for this place...

MR SUIT points to the window a menu faces the street.

MR SUIT

This place isn’t even a good restaurant. Its one of those half decent places where poor people take loved ones on birthdays as a treat. Tame the Salmon Movsee, £7. That’s £7 for whipped fish at a crap restaurant.

MR SUIT spins round and points across the road to a large restaurant.

MR SUIT

That however, is a very, very good restaurant.

Time-Cut. MR SUIT is stood infront of the good restaurant.

MR SUIT

This is the kind of place you want to take someone on a first date to impress them. To create the right impression. These people at the window.

Sat in the restaurant by the window are two well dressed men in suit and tie. One has a laptop on the table.

MR SUIT

They think its good enough to hold a business meeting. The last thing you need when discussin multi-million pound deals is a chunk of gristle between your teeth.

The man with the laptop closes it and tucks into his meal.

MR SUIT

Look at the menu at this place. Those three Michelin stars... there not from the tyre people. The chef at this place even has one of those annoying TV shows.


2. INT - DAY - TV Kitchen.

The walls are covered in bright fruit and vegetable designs. In the middle a grinning chef stands over a stove with frying pan in hand. The CHEF puts something in the pan.

CHEF

...and if you fry the chilli with the syrup you will get the most lovely pudding.

MR SUIT (V.O)

Where they cook the most disgusting shit you will ever see in your life and then try to convince you that it will taste better that Gods sweat.


3. EXT - DAY - Outside Restaurant.

MR SUIT

Because of all that the £7 whipped fish now becomes £12 whipped fish. For the extra £5 Id expect at least a handjob from the waitress.

He sits back on a bench and pauses.

MR SUIT 

But there are ways to eat on the cheap. Sometimes even for free.


4. Int - Day - Restaurant.

A blonde hared man sits at a table in the restaurant he takes the napkin from the table unfolds it  and places it on his lap. He is dressed in jeans and shirt. A leather jacket is draped over the back of his chair.

The slim attractive waitress puts his plate of food down in front of him.

MR BLONDE

Can I have a glass of water please? Thanks.

The waitress turns away. MR BLONE cuts into his food. HE begins to eat. After a couple of mouthfuls the waitress brings the glass of water.

MR BLONDE

Thank you.

He puts the glass of water to his lips. TIME-CUT. He takes the water away from his lips and puts the glass on the table. His plate is empty. The waitress walks past.

MR BLONDE

Excuse me Can I have the bill please. Thanks.

The waitress walks off to go and get the bill. MR BLONDE stands up from his chair and puts his jacket on. The waitress comes over with the bill. MR BLONDE reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a gun. He holds it to the waitresses head, she screams. The people in the restaurant scream and duck for cover.

MR BLONDE

Okay everybody this is...


5. Ext - Day - Outside.

MR SUIT is sat on the bench.

MR SUIT

I think you guessed what was going on. Now, I only recommend that technique if you are holding the resturant up anyway. That has to be the main focus, but you do get a free meal as well.


6. Int - Day - Busy Restaurant.

A small but busy restaurant. A tall slender WAITRESS is carrying a tray full of glasses over to a table. She puts the tray down on the table and hands out the drinks.

CUSTOMER

Thank you.

As WAITRESS walks away the people at the table swap their drinks. At the restaurant doorway stands a young man in a designer shirt and blue tinted sunglasses.

MR BLUEEYES

Jade. Hey Jade.

WAITRESS turns and looks at MR BLUEEYES, she smiles.

MR BLUEEYES

I need to talk to you.

WAITRESS

I cant Im busy cant it wait.

MR BLUEEYES

No it cant ask someone to cover for you.

WAITRESS

Alright, alright. Hang on a second.

MR BLUEEYES beckons WAITRESS over. She walks up to him. He pecks her on the cheek.

MR BLUEEYES

Be Quick.

WAITRESS walks away towards the till area where there are other waitress's gathered together. MR BLUEEYES follows her with his eyes, whilst he us watching her his mobile phone rings.

MR BLUEEYES takes the phone out of his trouser pocket.

MR BLUEEYES

Hello

He Pauses.

MR BLUEEYES

I’m sorting it out now. It should be fine.

He pauses. WAITRESS waves MR BLUEEYES over.

MR BLUEEYES walks toward WAITRESS.


7. Ext - Day - Alley at the back of the restaurant.

The alley is completely empty. There is only a large green bin. A door opens and WAITRESS exits followed by MR BLUEEYES.

WAITRESS

What was so desperate then?

MR BLUEEYES grins. He takes waitress in his arms and kisses her. He puts his hand inside her shirt. WAITRESS breaks off the kiss.

WAITRESS

Is that what was so important?

MR BLUEEYES

Yes, but there is something else.

MR BLUEEYES twirls WAITRESS'S hair.

MR BLUEEYES

Tomorrow night I have to take out my cousin for dinner. I don’t have much cash at the moment, so I was wondering If I could come here...

WAITRESS lets go of MR BLUEEYES and turns away.

MY BLUEEYES

I only want a discount or something. I’m not going to take the piss.

MR BLUEEYES puts his arms around waitress.

MR BLUEEYES

Please. Its not bad enough I have to take my bloody cousin for a meal but i have to spend out as well?

He kisses her neck.

WAITRESS

I'll see what I can do.

MR BLUEEYES

Now, what do you want to do tonight?


8. Ext - Evening - Street.

MR BLUEEYES is walking along the street with a tall busty blonde.

BARBIE

Are you sure this is going to work?

MR BLUEEYES

It will.

BARBIE Kisses him.

BARBIE

You are so smart baby.

MR BLUEEYES

I know.


9. Int - Night - Restaurant.

MR BLUEEYES and BARBIE sit down at a table. BARBIE starts to stroke MR BLUEEYS let with her foot.

MR BLUEYES

You'd better stop that or we wont get to eat.

WAITRESS wanders over to their table.

WAITRESS

Hi baby.

WAITRESS pecks MR BLUEEYES on the cheek.

MR BLUEEYES

Jade this is my cousin Barbara.

BARBIE

Pleased to meet you.

MR BLUEEYES

How much are we going to pay?

WAITRESS

You aren’t.

MR BLUEEYES

Here I told you how much I love you?

WAITRESS smiles and walks away. BARBIE stars to rub MR BLUEEYES upper leg with her unshoed foot.

MR SUIT (V.O)

This approach is not limited to just one meal.

BARBIE is sat at the table.

MR SUIT (V.O)

After all, people have lots of relatives. Time-Cut. A giner haired girl is now sat at the table.

MR BLUEEYES

This is my cousin from Scotland.


Time-Cut. A brunette is sat at the table.

MY BLUEEYES

My niece.

MR SUIT (V.O)

When you run out of family, be more creative.

MR BLUEEYES

...an old school friend.

Time-Cut. A black haired girl is sat at the table.

MR BLUEEYES

...my aunties dogs cousins brothers cats son in law.

WAITRESS slaps MR BLUEEYES.


10. Ext - Day - Bench Outside Restaurant.

MR SUIT

Eventually, she will suss you out. But by then you will have saved alot of money.

MR SUITS stops and looks around the street. He watches a man sat at a table outside a coffee shop.

MR SUIT (V.O)

Another way to save money is to try what the guy at the table is doing.

The man at the table is wearing a blue shirt and trousers. He is sipping the last of his coffee.

MR SUIT (V.O)

When the waitress comes over with the bill he is going to offer her a deal.

The waitress goes over to the table and the man starts to say something. We cant hear because we are too far away.

MR SUIT (V.O)

He's going to say; if I give you half of the bill straight in your pocket you don’t see me walk away.

The waitress mouths something angrily.

MR SUIT (V.O)

She is telling him to piss off. The reason why is apparent when you take a look at his table. 

Close up of the table. On the table is an empty cup of coffee and a newspaper.

MR SUIT

All he has bought is a cup of coffee. HE got the newspaper before he got on the train this morning. That cup of coffee cost just £2. He is offering the waitress £1. Id tell him to piss off as well.

MR SUIT puts his hand in his pocket and takes out a small piece of paper.

MR SUIT

For it to work you need a large bill.

MR SUIT outs his hand in his pocket and takes out a small piece of paper.

MR SUIT

This bill is from when I took a number of friends out to dinner. It comes to £300. I offered the waiter one fifty and he practically bit my hand off for it. You have top make it worth the waiters while.

MR SUIT screws up the piece of paper. He stands up from the bench.

MR SUIT

I hope that you use this advice well.

MR SUIT straightens his suit.

MR SUIT

All this talking has made me hungry. I’m off for my free meal...

He reaches into his blazer pocket and takes out a gun.

MR SUIT

...and a little something after.

MR SUIT turns his back to us and walks towards the restaurant.

(Angel) Unlock Me
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Insignificant as i may be
does anyone know the real me?
deep inside my mind
many thoughts i struggle to find.
I have a deeply troubled soul
in my life, a painful hole.
What is missing? I do not know.
My sadness and sorrow i cannot show.
Why..and when, did it start?
This aching feeling in my heart
Every day i feel this pain
from it, what do i gain?
I now have a heart, of stone so cold
but please be kind, and do behold
If you are willing to take a slice
you will find inside the emotionless ice
a burning flame of passion
with a loving type of fashion.
If you unleash this fire
my heart will spark, a live wire.
Ice shall melt away
gradually, day by day.
The real me shall be free,
the lock undone, with the magic key.

(|PaRiS|) "How to use your Atari ST as a Dumb Telnet Terminal." 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Originally written for www.sanction.org.uk.

The Atari ST (First really mass produced in 1983) is a large, desktop based, 16Bit low spec low maintenance machine with a 3 1/2 inch disk drive, anything from 1/2 to 4 Meg RAM and a built in operating system (which it's creators unfortunately named...) TOS, complemented (*snigger*) by a GUI named GEM (Which stands for Graphix Environment Manager). Now I've had one of these lying around idle for a good long while, and I hate having things lying around that I cant use. And another problem I have at the moment is I only have one PC. So I think to myself, "The last time I had another PC" I think "What was it and what did I do with it?" and the answers to those questions are simple it was a 486, and I used it to serial link to my main PC and primarily as a Telnet terminal, and occasionally to run a MiRC client from (When I had mate's round etc). So off goes the light bulb in my head, I cant afford another PC right now, so maybe I could use my Atari ST as a Telnet Terminal? And I could. How? I'll tell you. 

Instructions 
------------ 
First of all, and this is vital this is, you will a free serial port on your PC. Naturally. Then you will a Null Modem (Serial to Serial Cable), you will then need to download some Software (all of which is on www.sanction.org.uk/atari/). The Software you need is as follows: - STERM: This is a kind of Telnet Server for your serial (com) ports. Install this on your PC, its small sexy and easy to setup. Follow the guidelines set out below 1. Baud Rate should be set to 19200 (Thats as quick as non-modified ST's get) 2. Put BOTH the listed HAND SHAKING settings to ON (This seems to work best) - KMTERM: This is a VT100 Emulator for the Atari ST, ie. Its a Telnet Client which connects to your serial port (Which in then connects to your PC, which in turn directs traffic to STERM, which then allows you to go out and onto the internet and access what ever internet address's you see fit to access). - EMULATOR.ACC: This is the standard VT52 Emulator which comes with the Atari ST language disk, this works for connecting to UNIX Shells etc, but struggles with anything complicated, I strongly recommend using KMTERM instead. - Whichever ST Terminal program you use, the settings should mirror the STERM settings. ie. Baud Rate 19200, HAND SHAKING ON (If you can only choose one HANDSHAKE choose RTS/CTS, it appears to work better). Oh yeah, you have to reconfigure KMTERM every time you use it, don’t blame me, blame the programmer. Ditto for EMULATOR.ACC. And Robert’s you father's brother. As soon as you load KMTERM (or Emulator.acc) click the "Serial" button on STERM and you should (Hardware problems with your PC serial ports aside...) see The STERM standard greeting (or the greeting you have set). Type HELP for a list of STERM commands and away you go. 

Compatibility: 
-------------- 
As before mentioned the vt52 emulator although good to test the initial linkup isnt much practical use for anything on the internet because most if not all systems use vt100. Like I said before, use KMTERM. So far I have tested KMTERM with the following *NIX programs: 

PINE - Works Fine. 
PICO - Works Fine. 
MAIL - Works Fine (Even works "Okay" in vt52) 
BitchX - Loads, but its touch n go if you would be prepared to use it. 
TELNET - Naturally works fine along with other "Basic" commands. 

I assume a more basic IRC client would work (Such as IRCII). But I have not tested so dont quote me on it. But the concept of IRC from your Atari ST with BitchX should have all the Amiga users in owe, because techincally BitchX is better than Amirc (That should stir things up abit...) 


Ideas: 
------ 
If you dont intend to use your ST for anything other than as a TERMINAL, why not load KMTERM Automatically on boot? (Either from your HD, if you have one, or floppy). If you are going to use your ST for things other than as a TERMINAL you should probably install Tera Desk, its much better than GEM which is frankly pants. Tera Desk is also available from www.sanction.org.uk/atari/. I wish you happy ST'ing. Long live the *STILL USFULL* Atari (At this rate it will out live us, I mean mine is 17 years old ffs).

(Laura) Lost Hope.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Her crimson tears streaked down her face,
Smooth as glass.
Inside, her mind is boiling
With the realisation
Of the murderous breed
That walks amongst the fallen angels.
That she had once been a part of.
This once beautiful winged creature
With a voice that soothes the suffering,
Now lives in an eternity of continuous pain
As she bleeds forever unto the earth.
her fruitless attempts.
To sing in a rapture as she had before
Results in screams of pain
Even the most blissful spirits
Shudder at her voice.
The one that was once loved.
Is now shunned.
Because of what this world has done to her.
There will be no mercy
For the deteriorated soul.
There will be no second thoughts
For the misplaced life.
There will be no recognition
Of what has been used and thrown away.
Just the stain on the earth
That was caused by itself.

[The Mysterious Cities of Gold...]
I think you're right-it went on and on so long that in the end no-one was
sure whether the point was to find the cities of gold, (which they didn't
ever do) or to find Esteban's father, or to save Tal's people from the
Spanish conquest, or to find Tal a bird to shag, or for Esteban and Zia
to get together... or was it just to fly that big golden bird around?
very very bizarre cartoon. I guess if you put the french and the japanese
together whatever will they come up with? (probably art-house woodland
fairy manga porn these days....) sheer class mind. - kath.

2 channel compressed bollocks, use ogg vorbis, www.vorbis.com much cleaner, crisper sounding audio, doesnt sound compressed, and is multi-channel, filesizes are about the same size as similarly encoded mp3s, but this format will be backwards and forwards compatible, is about 40 times more complicated than mp3 and sounds 20 times better, it is also open source and version 1.0 has just been released, download cd'n'go and start using ogg vorbis today, i have just converted all my mp3 collection (about 2500 files) to ogg, get the winamp plugin at: http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml componentId=60647

[@stake - US to Help Chinese Evade Web  Censorship]
The US government's International Broadcasting Bureau is in discussions with security vendor Safeweb to deploy additional Safeweb infrastructure to help Chinese citizens to browse the world wide web without being monitored by the Chinese government. The Safeweb technology itself uses an intermediary secure proxy/web server that the client communicates with using SSL. This intermediary server then downloads web content on behalf of the client web browser, and then returns it to the client web browser encrypted using SSL. An external entity attempting to monitor web usage would only see encrypted traffic passing back and forth from the Safeweb intermediary server to the web browser, and would significantly hamper the monitoring of the actual nature and source of the web content.

(PaRiS) The Watcher...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Things just aint the same for crackers
Times is changing, the young hackers is age'in
Becoming OG's or sellouts and changing
To make way for these new names 'n faces...

But the strangest things can happens from hacking
When hackers get wrapped up in image and acting
Hackers get bought up and sell out for cash
Zipped up in corporatism, when it happens that’s that.

Ive seen 'em come, Ive watched 'em go,
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em fall,
Watched 'em blossom and watched em grow,
Watched the law suits when they lost their flow,

Best friends 'n money; Ive lost 'em all,
And now they still all search of my fall,
And its all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show.

[Chorus]
Everywhere that I go, aint the same as before,
(The Watcher)
People I used to know just dont know me no more,
(The Watcher)
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know,
(The Watcher)
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low.
(The Watcher)

I moved off the big nets for good, you blame me?
Hackers get mad at hackers they cant be,
But the mother fuckers cant hit what mother fuckers cant see, 
Im out of sight now, Im out of their damn reach,

How would you feel if hackers wanted your root?
You'd prolly move to a new nick, on a new serv
And choose a new spot to shot,
See I aint a thug, I watched too many leave like that.

But I aint no bitch niether,
Its either my bandwidth or yours dog,
And I aint leaving.
I like warez stealing.

Coz' lil' hacker we can go packet for packet
byte for byte full attack it, attack it,
Bitch if you really wanna take it there we can,
But just remember your fucking with a self made man.

I got a lot more to loose than you do
Just remember that,
When you wanna come try and fill these shoes
Yeah, Im The Watcher.

[Chorus]

Things just aint the same for hackers,
Cops now got sanctions to put us in handcuffs,
They wanna hang us.
Keep us enslaved without trust.

Keep us trapped in the same place as the others are,
Then they wonder why we act so crazy,
Run around stressed out and fuck shit up like we aint lazy,
Its Because when you let an animal out a cage its dangerous, you get it,

But now we got a new era of hackers, crackers, phreaks and youngsters,
Living amungst us...
Looking at us now; calling _us_ busters
Cant help but remember when it was us...

Mofo, we started this hacker shit,
This the mother fucking thanks we get?
Funny how time flys...
And im just having fun watching it fly by.

[Chorus]

(JerichoZZ) Computer Eyestrain Syndrome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Originally by Barry Auchettl B.Bus. Dip.Ed. Grad.Dip.R.E. - Edited and additions made by JerichoZZ)

Intro
-----

Okay so first of I is no expert on these matters, so thats why I feel the need to include Mr Barry Auchettl article, who is completing a masters on the effect of computers on vision.

This CES computer eyestrain syndrome, as it goes, I have had it since the summer of 94.  I blamed it on tired eyes, and in a way I wasn't wrong but I never knew that it would get fucking serious.  What pisses me off is I have been using computers since '87 (remember C64's?) but machines with screens have existed much more than that, so why all of a sudden does it get recognised now?

RSI has been recognised and a whole load of shit is available to excerise your wrists and joints, and people have schmoooozed many days off work and even sued over there poor little hands.

Is CES another spinoff so people can take more days off work, sue allover again.  Well I am not sure, because I am suffering from it. I am glad I am in France now, and not left victim to the NHS.

I had been to the opticians, in the UK, I had eye tests, no prescriptions were given, no recommendations were ever given, just a smile and "your eyesight is fine I can't do anything for you"...  you bastards I say.


Here is Barrys' rundown of CES.
-------------------------------


Visual problems occur for people working with computers. Some symptoms 
related to work and computers include headaches ('headaches' no more like physically crippling migraines - JerichoZZ), sore eyes (he makes it sound so tame - JerichoZZ) and blurred vision (for so long I blamed booze - JerichoZZ). For industry, this leads to a loss in productivity as a result of lower concentration levels and potential insurance claims caused by eyesight problems.  (the whole new schmooze i was talking about - jerichozz).


Almost every worker now comes into contact with computers with the approach of the new technological millennium (true, and this makes me think, I can't be the only bastard to have this, where is everyone else hiding? conspiracy theory perhaps? - jerichoZZ). Ten years ago, Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) was the main concern with computers, particularly amongst office staff. To day, Computer Eyestrain Syndrome (CES) is fast becoming the dominant factor at home and at work.


Headaches or eyestrain can occur if computers are improperly arranged, from poor lighting the work space area and insufficient break time is given for the eyes during a long task that tries to be completed in one go. They also occur if an incorrect prescription is used for close up work. A person working on the computer wearing glasses designed for long distance may experience greater fatigue. (ok whatever, my workstation was a fucking proper cotch spot, leather chair with auto recline lots of levers and hydraulics, etc.  I first suffered of loss of sight after a 2 week mission playing DUNE on my 386 while I was billy no mates cos all my bods had gone on holiday... so non stop screen action was the deal, no sleep never helped either - jerichoZZ)


A variety of measures can be taken in order to reduce the effect of CES. First of all, computers should be set up to provide maximum comfort (Done -JerichoZZ) and minimise visual stress (Done -JerichoZZ) . This would include an adjustable chair (Done -JerichoZZ) and a swivel stand for the monitor (Done -JerichoZZ) in order for the screen to be adjusted to the most suitable angle (Done -JerichoZZ). The standard of monitors has also increased dramatically in recent years with various screens to reduce glare and the electromagnetic fields generated by computers. Yet too many people still persist with an old monitor as they upgrade the other components of their computer. Decreasing the effect of CES should be just as important as upgrading the memory or disk space. (NOW THEY FUCKING TELL ME! - JerichoZZ)

Not all people look at the monitor in the same way (some see it through 
their ass I guess - JerichoZZ). The amount of visual stress caused by 
watching the monitor will vary according to the task required to be 
completed. Word processing is more likely to create CES as it requires more text entries than other software packages such as spreadsheets and databases (He forgets to mention Dune but I have, so all is ok xos the world has been warned - JerichoZZ). Those most affected are people entering data throughout most of the day. Programmers would normally require the least amount of time at the screen, yet often are affected by "binging" at the computer (I have no idea what he means, but this is one thing even the e7it3 must ph3ar - JerichoZZ).

The Internet has also led to many people staring at a screen both at home and at work ( no shit Sherlock - JerichoZZ). The amount of time spent viewing the screen and other source documents will have an impact on CES. Yet it is here that measures can be easily taken to help compensate the effects of eyestrain. Looking away to rest the eyes should always be done when waiting for the next URL to be downloaded. Something as simple as this would not only improve eyestrain but will lead to increased concentration when looking at the next site. (ok so this sounds true enough, but with high bandwidth now available how much time have you got to look away? next recommendation please? - JerichoZZ)

It is important not to learn to stare at the screen, as this is the major cause of CES. Blinking every three to five seconds helps to avoid redness, itching of the eyes and decreases the chance of headaches (well my problem in particular was I have to got to a point where I don't blink, as my tear ducts don't work correctly because of it much pain and blurred vision I have been told to blink twice as much as he says just to get the fuckers working again - JerichoZZ). It also helps breaks the habit of staring and over-concentration (another problem - JerichoZZ). Another simple method is to stop and take a few deep breaths every ten minutes which can help relax the shoulders and take the pressure off the eyes. (Fuck off, my shoulders are not to blame, they are fine - JerichoZZ)

There are numerous exercises that can be undertaken in order to reduce the amount of stress on the eyes. The easiest and most well known exercise is palming. Palming involves cupping your hands and placing them over your closed eyes without actually touching the eyes. Take a minute to simply breathe and relax. Notice whether you see black or colours in your mind. For some people, their hands may feel extremely warm or tingly. The act of palming not only relaxes the physical eye but also energises the entire body. (I know a much more interesting type of massage also called palming, but I am told that too much of that will also make you blind so its a no win each way - JerichoZZ)

Increased dependence on computer based work is creating increased 
absenteeism (I use whatever excuse I can, but this one sounds like a winner, I reckon  you can get at least a week off, all you have to do is moan about a headache and claim you can't see things - JerichoZZ), and potential insurance claims caused by eye health problems (weeks off work and a cash bonus, can't be true but it is, start it now, I will help you - JerichoZZ). 
These occupational, health and safety concerns are currently being addressed by business. The Computer And Vision Enhancement (CAVE) Program offers an unique investment in the maintenance of eye health by incorporating simple exercises and awareness. It is based on an educational model rather than a medical one (I seem to always prefer the drugs approach - JerichoZZ).

In the future, RSI may be reduced with the advent of voice activated 
commands reducing the need using a keyboard. However, as long as people 
remain focused on the screen, there will be a continual rise and concern regarding the eye health of anyone using a computer (we need direct neuro link bypassing the need to even use our eyes, until then I guess we are fucked - JerichoZZ). With over 50% of the adult population now wearing some sort of corrective lenses, that figure could increase considerably if steps are not taken to reduce CES at home and at work. (from the shit I went through, corrective lens won't help, new fucking eyes seemed to be the answer - JerichoZZ).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok, I know, some people out there are thinking, this is a fucking wind up. Well how about you test it out for your self.  Take a friend or colleague and compare the number of times they blink when they use a machine, over minute or two and then see how many time they blink when they talk to you away from a screen.

So the moral of the story is:

"Boys with no penis can easily amuse girls with a stupid puppet show"

no that wasn't it...

You are probably already suffering and don't know it, or are on your way to few days blurred vision so I will quote sienfeld;

"starring at breasts is like starring at the sun, you get a quick glimpse then you look away"

Don't stare at the fucking screen cos it will fuck you up.  Remember to 
blink.

( .AaronX ) 0.0: Won't my hacker break into my computer and steal my trade secrets?
( .AaronX ) No. Hackers aren't, contrary to media reporting, the people who break into computers. Those are crackers. Hackers are people who enjoy playing with computers. Your hacker may occasionally circumvent security measures, but this is not malicious; she just does it when the security is in her way, or because she's curious.
( .AaronX ) ;)
( .@|PaRiS| ) trax: you done any articles for the soljo....
( .@|PaRiS| ) AaronX: Your giving US a lecture on hacking ethics... WHO IN THE BLUE HELL ARE YOU???
( .@|PaRiS| ) Fucking little prick. The original term cracker didnt mean that at all, crackers are those who break copy protection on something, your just reading a lamer new definition, and a media one at that. Fuck off.
( .^cronus^ ) aaron is a she ?!? 'she just does it...'

<SOL> Conference: Copy Party 2002...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Its a bold venture, but we hope with all your help we can actually make this happen. So
what are we talking about? A Conference. A Party. Call it what you will, you are ALL invited,
you are all welcome. We are to arrange the first SOL conference.

Copy Party 2002...
------------------

We plan to host this event in February/March 2002 in London, we estimate that tickets to the 
event will cost £5 (On the door or pre-booked). There will be a bar, there will be SOL crew +
many other names from this zine and others, there will be pineapple on sticks (Natch) there will be internet access. There will indeed be music, and much fun had by all.

Why?
----
To exchange ideas, celebrate the underground culture and generally speaking get abit drunk and have a wicked time, taking us back to all those copy parties in the old days; be they in your mates house just having a laugh or in a specially made camper van in the middle of the black forest (you know who you are!) the point is simple; lets have fun with this all.

The Catch...
------------
We need your help. SOL are not so much overstretched as lazy motherfuckers. We need a phatt website to aid us in promoting this event, we need ppl to design GFX for and this actual site, naturally we have a place to host it, naturally without your help it will probably get done anyway. But come on, join it; get involved. If you want to help with this event email paris@whitedust.net. 

We hope to see you all sometime in the near future at copyparty 2002. Until then, read the soljo to stay informed about copyparty 2002 information.

(Cronus) Nothingness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/intro/ 
I'm sure a wiser man than me has already named the topic I intend to write about. But for the benefit of the audience who, like me, aren't philosophers I am going to write about the theory of nothingness. And before the wise-ass in the back row points out that a theory of nothingness is a contradiction, let me point out that I am not paid 
to write these articles, nor do I have the education to seek payment - I write in the vain hope that the masses might actually think, I don't write to make sense. (Don't you just love the obligatory disclaimer ?) 

/nought/ 
When civilisation had only just come up with the clever idea of dragging itself from the evolutionary gutter it had no understanding of what latter-day society called ethics. Infact early civilisation was far too wrapped up in hunting for food and bartering for necessities, that it had no concept of ethics, traditions, laws or even (shock, horror) morals. 

People survived their day to day lives by spearing wild animals, trading meat for clothing and working on the roof of their dwelling to keep the winter rains out. They had little time for leisure, enjoyment was a foreign idea to them. The most profound thought of the time would have been the realisation that it made no sense to work on your dwelling unless you had clothes to keep you warm inside. And in the same vain it made little sense to worry about your warmth if you were starving to death. No one worried, much less actively, thought about what next week or next year might bring. 

The picture I am trying to paint is one of the simpler life. A life when you did what you needed to do to survive. And nobody would begrudge anyone else for trying their damnest to survive, which was blatantly the name of the game. 

/nada/ 
Time moved on and people wouldn't steal from a rouge trader as retribution, but rather they would turn to the leader of the people and seek vengeance publicly. The leader of the people  (King/Chieftain/Holy(wo)man) would use their power to exact retribution to maintain his place in the favourable light of the people. Laws were decreed to try and standardise the handling of 'crimes' such as theft, 
murder, adultery and the rest. If people knew what fate awaited them they might act responsibly, or so the thinking went. Forgivably, parental instinct wanted to protect the young from themselves and so taught them of these 'crimes', and the punishments inherent with them, as ethics. 

/zip/ 
It wasn't long in the bloody history of mankind (and others) that religion began to wrap its merciless fingers around the neck of civilisation. I won't go into details but suffice to say that the strength of religion hinged on the threats for those who disobeyed the religious leaders. 

The religious leaders taught the law of the land to their flock to stay on the right side of the genuinely powerful leader of the people. But now these laws were described as morals rather than ethics. Over a short space of time, 'crimes' moved from being punishable by your peers to punishment from the unstoppable force from above. 

If the average farmer/hunter/landlord/whatever hadn't gotten the point as a child that ethics needed to be followed, then the weight behind morals really drove the point home. 

/zelch/ 
Over the course of perhaps a dozen generations, mankind had moved from utter complacency with regard to his actions, to a state of constant fear for his choices in life. A intricate structure of laws, ethics, morals and beliefs now existed which controlled the way people lived. And when I say lived I am not referring to their day-to-day simple lives but to the ever more complex Pandora’s box that was their 
own free will. 

Laws, morals, ethics and what society would call 'acceptable behaviour' is nothing more than conditioning that has been breed into children for hundreds of decades. These ideas that modern civilisation clings to, under the guise of protecting us from ourselves, are all man-made. They have no basis is reality. 

But this brings us back to mid-article. If enough people believe in a God, there can 
be no doubt that a God does infact exist.

(JerichoZZ) If Men Wrote Cosmopolitan...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SUP mutha-feckerz (father-Jack influence on the West-Siiiiiide),

k it seems we were on the look out for new cutting edge regular articles to calm the constant moan of, I dunno what to write.

Well we didn't think of any, so I took a step away from cutting edge and decided for an agony aunt column, but how do you start one of those
without any problems to solve or in fact being the wrong sex to be an
official aunt.

So I found imaginary problems in the form of this joke email I received, when I get some more, and if I don't get real ones I will just make them up until I find it not funny any more or I might even borrow some from teenage girl magazines "can I get preggers standing up" sort of deal!

I am here is answer all questions on politics*, sex*, code*, martial life*, kung fu*, computer repair*, credit card fraud*, drugs*, music*, etc*.

I know you're all fecked (DO IT FATHER JACK!!!) in the head, so get writin and Aunt-JerichoZZ will sort it.

advice given clearly states to part with cash and to 'donate' to

   If Men Wrote Cosmopolitan...

   Q: My husband wants to experience three-in-a-bed-sex with me and my
      sister.
   A: Your husband is clearly devoted to you. He cannot get enough of
      you, so he goes for the next best thing your sister.  Far from being an
      issue, this will bring all of the family together. Why not get some
      cousins involved? If you are still apprehensive, then let him go with your
      relatives, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and don't
      mention this aspect of his behaviour.


   Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex with him.
   A: Do it. Sperm is not only great tasting, but has only 10 calories
      a spoonful. It is nutritious and helps you to keep your figure and
      gives a great glow to the skin. Interestingly, a man knows this. His offer
      to you to perform oral sex with him is totally selfless. Oral sex is
      extremely painful for a man. This shows he loves you. Best thing to do is to thank
      him, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal.


   Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.
   A: This is perfectly natural behaviour - and it should be
      encouraged. The man is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with
      other men. Far from being pleasurable, a night out with the boys is a stressful affair,
      and to get back to you is a relief for your partner.  Just look back at 
      how emotional and happy the man is when he returns to his stable home.
      Best thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a
      nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his behaviour.


   Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.
   A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband.  If you must
      mess with it, do it in your own time. To help with the family budget you
      may wish to video tape yourself while doing this, and to sell it at flea
      markets. To ease your selfish guilt, buy your man a nice expensive present and
      cook him a delicious meal.


   Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.
   A: Foreplay to a man is very hurtful. What it means is that you do
      not love your man as much as you should - he has to work a lot to get you
      in the mood. Abandon all wishes in this area, and make it up to him by
      buying a nice expensive present, and cooking a nice meal.


   Q: My husband has never given me an orgasm.
   A: The female orgasm is a myth. It is fostered by militant,
      man-hating feminists and is a danger to the family unit.  Don't mention it
      again to him and show your love to him by buying a nice expensive present and
      don't forget to cook him a delicious meal.


   Q: How do I know if I'm ready for sex?
   A: Ask your boyfriend. He'll know when the time is right. When it
      comes to love and sex, men are much more responsible, since they're not
      confused emotionally as women. It's a proven fact.


   Q: Should I have sex on the first date?
   A: YES. Before if possible.


   Q: What exactly happens during the act of sex?
   A: Again, this is entirely up to the man. The important thing to
      remember is that you must do whatever he tells you without question.
      Sometimes, however, he may ask you to do certain things that may at first
      seem strange to you. Do them anyway.


   Q: How long should the sex act last?
   A: There is no average time, but anything over two minutes is good.
      Anything under that and you may be rushing your man. After your man
      has finished making love, he'll have a natural desire to leave you
      suddenly, and go out with his friends to play golf. Or perhaps another
      activity, such as going out with his friends to the bar for the purpose of consuming
      large amounts of alcohol and sharing a few personal thoughts with his
      buddies. Don't feel left out-while he's gone you can busy yourself by
      doing his laundry, cleaning his apartment, or perhaps even going out to buy him
      an expensive gift. He'll come back when he's ready.


   Q: What is "afterplay?"
   A: After a man has finished making love, he needs to replenish his
      manly energy.  "Afterplay" is simply a list of important activities for
      you to do after the lovemaking. This includes lighting his cigarette, making
      him a sandwich or pizza, bringing him a few beers, or leaving him alone to
      sleep while you go out and buy him an expensive gift.


   Q: Does the size of the penis matter?
   A: Yes. Although many women believe that quality, not quantity, is
      important, studies show this is simply not true. The average erect
      male penis measures about 3 inches. Anything longer than that is extremely
      rare and, if by some chance your lover's sexual organ is 4 inches or over,
      you should go down on your knees and thank you lucky stars and do  
      everything possible to please him, such as doing his   
      laundry, cleaning his apartment and buying him an expensive gift.

Shit of the Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Reflection over the last few months of what was hot, what was not, who was lame and
who was kool; not to mention who we miss, who we dont and all the other random
irrelivent stuff has played a part.

lamers: #Radio1, RobinB, MattyB, DJ Evil et all, irc.mindfields.net (dear oh dear...) other
IRC lamers we have noted are SystemX, |Jason| (Rascist son of a bitch) and AaronX (The *King* 
of the lamers) all from Moonet.

Kewl People: fwaggle (for continued efforts with MOOnetIRCD), Cronus (for continued efforts with
www.whitedust.net)

We Miss: The Ultimate Warrior (Or "Ultimate Crack Head" depending on your view...), Knightmare,
and Various other Kids TV programs now deemed unsuitable for kids.
