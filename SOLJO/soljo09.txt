Double Hard Bastards...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scene opens with 3 suited and booted men knocking on the door of some sort of 
business premises. A newbie opens the door, he looks at the 3 men. The 3 men look 
at the newbie. The newbie continues his starring antics. The 3 men cool as fuck 
continue looking at the newbie. The newbie starts to sweat and tears come to his 
eyes, he makes a move to speak

"We're closed."

"We called this morning." says the leader of the 3 men.

"Come back tomorrow." the newbie says, trying to be elite.

Another man comes to open the door, to the relief of the newbie its his boss.

"Whats going on here then, who the fuck are you?" The boss, a bald version of cooksey, 
pulls an evil look.

"Are you Terry Cooksey?" The leader of the 3 looking directly at him.

"Who wants him?"

"I'm Jericho, err I mean Philip Morris, and these are my collegues llama and |PaRiS| umm I mean John Smith and David Jones."

Llama, speaks for the first time, "We're from the Inland revenue."

"You better come in boys," cooksey leads the way.

The 3 men are lead to an office, they are seated next to each other, the newbie has split, not to be seen or heard of again.  Cooksey sits behind his big flashy desk.  The 3 men place their breif cases upon their laps.

"So whats all this about." Cooksey seeming not to be interested.

"We're here to..." jericho's words are cut short, as 2 built like brick house script kiddies walk in.

"These are my partners, this is Bob and Caz." they take up defensive positions either side of Cooksey.

The 3 men, do not pay attention to any of them.

Cooksey continues his introductions, "These men are from the tax office" he sits forwarding leaning towards the seated men.  "somethings not right boys, I've been in business for 150 - 200 years" (a typical Cooksey lie) "and I've never had any tax men come to my office before, what is that?"

Jericho speaks "We are here on a fact finding mission, we are here to give you to a better service"

Relief poors out of Cooksey as he says sighs, he laughs, "well go ahead"

"right, we'll get started then" the 3 men open their brief caces to reveal their guns, but these remain hidden from cooksey as the brief cases are still open.

"Ok, question 1, How long have you been in business?"

"HAHa ha ha, I dunno 700 - 800 years"

"you getting this John" llama pretending to be writing down information.

"Question 2, Do you pay a) too little tax, b) too much tax or c) just enough tax?"

"Everyone pays too much tax."

llama confirms "to-oo mu-ch t-ax"

"question 3, Have you ever heard of the SOL?"  With that everyone in the room rose to their feet, Cookseys men aiming pistols at the 3 men.  Jericho reveals his hidden weapon, a typical Bronson special, the barrel a good 2 feet long, with bullets that could take out a tank.  Llama reveals a banana, slightly over ripe, |Paris| reveals his chosen weapon, a samurai sword, he quotes something that sounds like something a samurai sort of person should say.

a stand off occurs, no man dares move or say anything, they stand around trying hard to think of something cool to say.  A mobile rings.

"excuse me cooksey," jericho says while patting down his coat for his mobile.  llama realises that he has part of his lunch in his hand and takes the momentary cease fire to locate his gun, he fails and continues to look like the bad man with a banana...

jericho answers the phone "hello."

"Hey Jericho it's me Nix^."

"I am right in the middle of a business meeting can I call you back?"

"No wait listen..."

"|PaRiS| is right next to me..."

"I just have to tell you that a parody of 'Hard Men' is a shit idea..."

|PaRiS| puts his samurai away to point an Uzi 9mm at jericho, and Jericho panics.
"look its a small part, just make baby noises and put phone down..." 

Jericho smiles and says no more, he puts phone down.  |PaRiS| whispers "I'll have words with you after this parody" and points his gun at the script kiddies.

Jericho continues with the story... "sorry for the interuption Cooksey, I don't wanna incident we just wanna talk."

Llama steps forward... "PUT YOUR GUNS DOWN"

Cooksey gives them the nod and they put their guns on the desk....

Llama takes another mighty step forward... "HANDS ON YOUR HEAD"

Cooksey and his men raise their hands, 

"Not you Cooksey" says jericho with a 'your a prick' sort of tone.

Cooksey resumes his standing pose of alertness... 

"Now we can do this the hard way, or the easy way," jericho explains, "me I like the easy way, lazy see."

"what do you want?" cooksey says as he trembles...

"We want to know what you know about ^cF?"

Cooksey laughs, "I only have one word about them" everyone gathers around to here what has to be said...  "WANKERS"

|Paris| lunges his uzi in to the face of one of the script kiddies, breaking his nose and allowing blood to run everywhere... "This we know, tell us why your gay?"

Cooksey shows his anger "I have logs of this, I have friends in the FBI, in fact I am FBI, your going down, I am gonna sue, you'll hear from my lawyer"  he stops, realising that none of his statements are true, he worries.  "I have money, please leave me alone"

"We are SOL and we will not sell-out!" |Paris| says, pointing his gun at Cooksey...

Jericho points out that this isn't a commerical sell-out and says "a leave me alone fee would be £75,000"

"I got the money right here..." Cooksey mutters as he dives in to his desk draw and spills out wads of cash.  "Now there's your money, now fuck off"

"Count it Llama" Jericho orders, "I don't trust you Mr. Cooksey"

Llama feels it necessary to eat his banana, and takes the money away for counting.  Jericho and |Paris| remain to keep Cooksey and his minions under control...

llama returns, he found his weapon, a slightly under ripe banana, much more deadly than an over ripe one.

"£74,980" llama points out. pointing his banana at cooksey.

|Paris| is vexxed, "thats £20 short, do you know who your fucking with!"

"Relax I made a mistake," Cooksey mentions in an apologetic sort of way.

"the way of the samurai is not to relax, but to kill people who are clearly gay"  and does what your supposed to do with an uzi, 'point and spray'

With that being the signal llama fires his banana (don't ask me how - Ed) Jericho shoots 1 round from his gun and is knocked off his feet, a 6 foot hole occurs in the office wall, no one is hurt.

When the ammo from |Paris|'s uzi runs out he unleashes the sword once again and removes the heads of cookseys minions in go swoop.

The 3 men pause, |Paris| with a slight grin laughs, jericho covered in dust remains looking hard, and llama looks at the mess a loaded banana can make.

The men leave the premises, Jericho and llama look pissed off, |paris| empties tablets from a perscription only bottle.

"£20 short and you have to shoot up the place." Jericho mutters, 

"The geezers an asshole, he had it coming to him" explains |Paris|.

"What the fuck is that" says llama pointing to the tablets...

"What, Valium..." |paris| shouts as he chews...

"Without the steroids he thinks he's the terminator" explains jericho...

llama stops |Paris| from chewing, "look if you wanna do that shit you do it after work..."
"don't tell me what to do I can look after myself"

They start to fight, until they arrive at their car...

The men approach their car, a red Rolls Royce... they throw their brief cases in to the boot...

Whoo'd dah BAD MAN whoo'd is 'ere!

Maybe the story will continue, 

Maybe I'll be lazy and it won't,

Maybe a monkey may fly out of my butt,

Maybe it won't?

<PaRiS> Editorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well issue 9 ay, and im actually writting this editorial at a sensible time of the day; who would have thought it. its been another patternted SOL "long month" but frankly you can blow me, as can all the ppl harrasing me about approving subscriptions on the mail list. Im Busy :) *grin*. Anway...

Ive rediscovered Garage. Which is definatly a good thing, although this month I have been using !'s on IRC alot for the first time ever, I dont know why. Im not sure Im happy with it. Maybe I am maybe Im not. Who knows. HAHAHA. Etc.

Anyone remember my Under ground IRC Network idea? Well its finally been taken up by someone else and if ya care ot visit #luckstruck on xnet (xone.xnet.org 6667) you will find various IP's of the various underground server's there, 6 servers are planned 2 are almost constant and 4 are linked if you see what I mean, SOL will be running sol.underground.net and angel.underground.net respectivly. Angel's up n running already like.

Just like to say "hi" and welcome back to Kleptic (he of TDA fame) who as you may notice submitted a number or articles for this issue. Klep is currently looking for all the Discordia (another zine) back issue to convert to HTML; if anyone has any mail em to kleptic@grex.org.

The site "Should" get updated when I finish this issue, like now. :) So there. Writting some music for a demo at the moment, anyone wants to do the whole gfx theme for an SOL demo disk  contact me on IRC, im usually there, or idl3.

SOL, and The PaRiS, back on form. Word to ya kitten.

"Paris didnt do it"

<PaRiS> Dont Say What Might Have Been (Part IV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There was something in the air this evening; as the band played a succession of slow, but strangly upbeat songs and the balloon's strayed off into the night, the water in the swimming pool rippled pleasingly, the dim lighting creating just the right atmosphere as the crowds of people wanderd and mingled, drinks in hand, the warm summer air intensified by the sounds of distant crickets chirping away from somewhere beoned the mansion like school conference centre.

A cigerette falls seemingly from the sky, landing at the feet of an unknown boy, smoke trailing from its still lit end. The boy looks down with some disapproval, almost a tut as he steps away from the offending object he slips his hands into his tuxedo's pockets and once again trys to concentrate on what his friends are saying.

"This is the best party ever! I cant beleive we are all going off to college..." Says one of the boys friends, another boy of around 16 or 17 years old.

"I know man" a third boy. "Its just not right; school just gone so quickly... Dont you think Rem?"

The first boy looks up, considers "Yes" he says, something in his voice not at all fitting with the jolly words of his counterparts, or indeed the party atmosphere of the night, a resigned smile crosses his frowning face "It's all gone so very quickly."

The others seemingly ignore the apparent displeasure of their freind. "Yeah... been a blast though. Right Im off for more drinks, you coming Rem?"

Rem shakes his head. "No... I'll stay here for a while."

"Come on man, she's in there..." The boy winks "I saw her earlier."

Rem turns away and glances up to the full moon "No I'll stay here, I'll be in in a moment."

The other two boys shrug and begin to work their way through the mass of people toward the bar which is apprently housed inside the impressive looking building. The first mutters something "He should get over it man..." The other nods in agreement.

Rem sighs... The night seems to fade from his thoughts; which instead linger on he past. What he has done, what he could have done; but most importantly what he should have done. The most distressing factor "I still dont know..." He whispers somewhat the the world in general and his conciousness fades back into the leaving party at hand.

Another cigarette falls just behind him, dropped from the hand of a man perched upon a branch of a high tree. The figures long coat drifts silently in the wind as he watches. "It's not over." he says loud enough for Rem to hear.

Rem spins on the spot, and looks up into the tree... catching a glimpse and a man, and a grin before the figure leaps down from the tree and seems to disapear into the darkness. Rem blinks. Now I'm seeing things, I shouldnt have come, this evening is only getting worse.

He turns back around the face the party. The man from the tree smiles broadly at him. He jumps back... "What the fuck?!"

"Indeed." Smiles the man. "My name is Desirei'.... Its not French." He adds.

Rem does his best to regain his composure "And what? Look Im busy mate, and not in very good mood, you'll have a much better time talking to someone else..."

"Oh..." The Desirei mock frowns, turning to stand at Rem's side "So whats the problem?"

"No problem."

"There must be."

Rem looks at him "Who the Hell are you? Ive never seen you here?"

"Its a big school" Retorts Desirei'.

"Your about 20" Retorts Rem.

"Call me a teacher." Smiles Desirei' bringing to an end the abrubt crossfire of words.

"Whatever." Rem turns and shuffle's his hands in his pockets, glancing around the party, scanning the distant faces.

"So whats the problem?" Asks Desirei'.

"Why should I tell you?"

"I have no idea, but people generally do." Desirei' appears to consider this "Samual said its all part of the job." He scratches behind his ear.

Rem looks, perhaps for the first time at the man. Desirei' appears tall, dark, and has those classic features. He seems... Almost too much. Rem looks away; not bothered enough to question the seemingly strange visual effect of the man. "Girls, same as always" he says without actually wanting to.

"I see... Lack of? Or..."

"One in particular."

Desirei smiles "Go get her." 

"I can't. She doesnt want me."

Desirei frowns, and looks Rem up and down, "Why, there nothing wrong with you? Is she the..." He searches his modern vocab database "Babe of the school?"

"Far from it."

"Then whats the problem?"

"I have no idea." Rem sighs and shakes his head, pulling his hands from his pockets and folding his arms.

Desirei' raises an eyebrow "Odd" he says.

"Yes" Rem turns to the man... who has gone. He spins on his heel and scans the crouds. No sign. He blinks. Who was he just talking with? He blinks again? Where are his friends... He walks abruptly, somewhat spooked but unsure exactly why toward the bar... making his way through the throng of people.

There they are.

His heart sinks, ache's and almost explodes all at the same time. There SHE is. He blinks, looks away, trys to compose himself; fails. Turns on his heel. Makes a valient fight for control; turns around again and stalks toward her... them. Whatever.

"Hi"

"Hi Rem" Say the males in unison.

"Hi Rem" She says...

Rem trys to smile, trys to act happy; when all he realy wants to do is stare at the girl in front of him. He cannot find the words; he doesnt KNOW any words. All he has is feelings, and all they do is hurt. "Hey people... whats up?"

A blinding flash of light.

"Stop this." The Desirei steps from behind someone, in a very improbable manner. 

"Stop what?" A women, dressed in a long white dress, and equally as confussing to gaze upon as the Desirei, steps from behind someone else in the crowd; whom all stand like statues in the hall. Even the sound of the crickets as stopped. There is only silence and her words "What has it to do with you Sir?"

"Its not fair...." The Desirei crosses his arms.

"Its his will." The women looks down at Desirei from accross the room, a clear line of sight between them having somehow developed.

"I dont care; if I cared about that I would have never fallen..." He hisses.

"Oh please." She rolls her eyes "You Demons are so alike; so moral, yet flawed in the fact you do not grasp to the concept of a greater good, its all now now now for you isnt it?"

"Far from it. Ive seen the greater good, Ive even spoken with him, and in my opinion he has just as much clue as the rest of us; ie, none. Therefore his greater good is just the same as our now now now. The difference being he has an army of so called angels to come down here and do his dirty work for him."

The Angel, for thats exactly what she was, frowns... "I find your lack of faith disturbing." She sighs... "But it matters not, you cannot stop this; it is written."

The Desirei takes a step foward. Suddenly, without any warning, the walls of the hall seem to shimer, fade from reality; figures step from behind other frozen statues... Angels...

"We are the Resht'tu... You will leave this place Demon." Smiles the Angel, taking a step toward Desirei`, her wings somehow unfolding behind her, her white dress flowing in the sudden deadly cold breeze.

The Desirei growls... "This isnt over Resht'tu; You know what he could be, and you know what will happen if..."

She interupts him "All speculation. It matters not. Those possibilitys are not his will. His will will be done." She tilts her head to one side.

"Your nothing but slaves."

"And you Sir are nothing but a criminal; an outlaw... and exile. Now be gone before this develops into something that you can no longer cover for."

The Desirei spits at her and turns on his heel. 

A Blinding flash of light. And all is as it was. The music playing, the warm summer air, the sounds of the party; even the crickets in the distances chriping.

"Not alot" Say the boys "We're just gonna go dance probably..."

"Ahh" says Rem, looking to the girl "You..." More courage than he would ever use again in his life now spill from his mouth "Fancy a dance..."

Somewhere, sometime, someplace and some-life-time a harp chord plays in the, or a, distance; unheard by all but two of the rooms inhabitants. Rem and the girl blink.

"No" she laughs and turns on her high heel marching off into the distance toward the dance floor, out of his life. His friends follow her, the last of the boys glances back in a "Sorry" kinda of gesture. Rem doesnt even see him. He turns; "Cut my loses" he thinks. He walks through the crowd of people.

Away from this school.

Away from her.

Away from a whole life that might have been.

Several streets away in begins to rain; a tropical storm of sorts, warm water beating down heavily upon him. Soaking him through; hiding the tears if nothing else. He wipes his wet sleeve across his face and stands beneath a dark street light sobbing.

In the distance, sitting beneath a hugh tree which serves the purpose of sheltering him from the rain stands the Desirei'. He exhales a thick cloud of cigerette smoke. And holds the Cigarette aloft "This is to what you might have been." He takes another drag. In the far distance thunder rolls. And the Desirei is gone.

A harp chord plays... Rem looks up into nothingness; barely hearing it, and a thought glides into his mind... "Dont say what might have been..." And he never did.

   Take a crisp dead president (dollar) and lay it face up with the george    (or who ever is on your dollar, depending on where you live in the world)
   facing the left. Now take the tape (preferably scotch but it doesn't       matter) make 2 strips each as long as the bill. Now tape 'em to the edge    of the dollar that is facing the way you are... like this:


                            +--+
                            |  |

Weed is like a step sideways in time - which as a consequence no longer travels evenly, instead seeming to flow like wave's, drifting at times, rushing at others,  in comparison with the standadised pulse of normal consious time. But ultimately it is a step which brings you _closer_ to reality, bringing your actions, the actions of others, your thoughts and memorys into perspective in a slow haze of realisation; giving you a sight above and beond normal conciousness. A sight which brings with it great empathy and understanding, a sight which brings with it harmony, both with others and your natural surroundings.

In particular, the new Human Rights Act's employee privacy provisions appear to conflict with RIP's surveillance guidelines. The RIP draft on Lawful Business Practice Legislation has been delayed while the government attempts to work out a resolution between the conflicting acts.

<JerichoZZ> Syndicate of London - Terrorist Profile...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As compiled by JerichoZZ, edited and additions by |Paris|.
(be afraid... be very afraid)

____________________________________________________________
Description
Lame software pirates, now and forever.  A group which suffers internal power struggles causing SOL to change profiles and agendas. Started by 3 operatives associated with several comunist political parties around the West London area, hell bent on gaining popularity for their cause.  
A forth operative (Animal Child) was also involved in the formation of SOL, but more as a mascot than anything else.

____________________________________________________________
Activities
Now mostly underground, SOL are responible for gathering information and freely sharing its finding with anyone who wants it.  
Other projects are always starting, with often 1 member being responsilbe for more than one project at any one time.

____________________________________________________________
Strengh
Unknown Strengh, estimated to be between 7-19

____________________________________________________________
Area of Operations
Originally London, England, but with the expansion of the internet SOL is now world wide baby yeah!

("West side, East side, World fucking wide")

____________________________________________________________
External Aid
Most groups and afiliations have provided to SOL's efforts, before being recruited themselves.  Notibly 'The Darkside Alliance'.  Although 'OYNX' (not the waste removal company) also sided with SOL against Terry Cooksey, but then so did every other IRC user.

____________________________________________________________
Political Objectives
Gather information, any means necessary.
Share Information, amongst the group and with anyone else deemed elite enough to warrant information sharing.
Elimination of Terry Cooksey.
Comsumption of alcoholic beverages on a regualr basis.
Destroy Capitalism, bring on the red flag of stalin.
Elimination of the Wrath of Eljack
____________________________________________________________
Background
Although SOL have run in relativly small numbers, they have many affiliations with other groups and other rouge operatives working on their own.  Most of these people have been a member of SOL, or will be a member shortly.
With no offical leader at SOL's formation, members had free thought and managed to get llama to do all the work. 
Captain Cake the unoffical leader would ensure the members destiny or they would face the wrath of his secret weapon, the 'back hander' which was feared by all.

____________________________________________________________
Selected Incident Chronology

Summer 1992 - SOL formed, 4 members

Autumn 1992 - SOLs' first/worst demo disk distributed.  Hitesh, DS_Mycroft and ^LONDON were the primary evaluators of the demo.

Autumn/Winter 1992 - First pirate demos relased

Winter 1993 - The Great snowball fight, SOL and its affiliated members of the time formed 2 seperate groups to confront each other in a capture the flag style event between Llamas front and rear garden.  Taking turns to storm each others area we eventually ran out of snow.
^LONDON devised the plan of a catapult to fire debris over the rear garden perimeter fence.  Captain Cake saw the potential in this idea and made it his own responsibility to form the first ammunition for the device.  With no snow left a stone/ice brick was developed and loaded.  The device was fired, ammo went up, and came down on Captain Cakes head.  We then opted for bats and bare fists.  Many dead, many injured, all fun.

March 1994 - Concept for a Magazine devised and produced within 2 weeks SP-Action.

April 1994 - First/Last SOL Maximum distrubuted.  3 days after release, authorities cut close on the tail of SOL member |Paris|.  The wrath of Eljack had informed them, |Paris| now sent home suspended, and the threat of legal action, SOL had an emergency meeting.  It was decided the group was going nowhere on the demo scene and now its newest venture the magazine was forced off the shelve.  SOL dispanded.  Captain Cake was not to be seen or heard of again, Animal Child was not awhere of anything, llama and |Paris| continued their exploits on the amiga and atari scene sometimes together sometimes independantly.  Other recruited members went their own way.

December 1994 - ^LONDON, discovers the internet, goes missing for 3 months.

Summer 1996 - |Paris| and Llama discover internet via an Amiga.  After a telephone conversation ^LONDON meets them on Dalnet #amirc.

Transitional Period - Between that summer of 1996 and the summer of 1998 many of the original members of SOL had formed new groups, dispanded those groups, joined and merged with others... but their was a lacking flaw in these groups, they for the most part were shite. DA formed, not to be confussed with TDA. DA - The Dark Alliance also known as the Dream Team consisited of a number of rated elite doodz including the Kingston 4 and Rue-the-Day.

Summer 1998 - TDA (the darkside aliance), dispanded due to a lost battle (the war was not over) with Terry Cooksey.  London has the concept of continuing were SOL left off, and together with |Paris| reform SOL. Da Dispanded, as its members go their own ways.

Summer 1998 - PaRiS and Mr Salt involved in high spead chase with 3 pursuit cars near Slough. No criminal charges are brought on anyone (Including the Police)

Summer 1998 - PaRiS cought in compromising position by Police officers in back of BMW. Never lives it down.

Autumn 1998 - First SOL website up and running, with more members that what SOL ever had we were away.

Summer 1999 - The best time for SOL, 5 days a week of partying, the Kingston 4 jokers, etc.

Autumn 1999 - SOL's second from worst time.  Summer was well gone and no one was around, or had moved on or had gone to prison or was too tied up in their own projects...

Xmas 1999 - |Paris| and ^LONDON formulate new ideas.

January 2000 - First online SolJo distributed.

Febrary 2000 - ^LONDON becomes JerichoZZ due to country change.

March 2000 - Llama begins work on the SOL bi-annual, this is never to be completed.

<Kleptic> A little bit about Mumia Abu-Jamal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mumia Abu-Jamal was a radio journalist in Philadelphia, known as "the
   voice of the voiceless" during the years of Mayor Frank Rizo. He was
   the recipient of a Major Armstrong Award for radio Journalism, and was  named one of Philadelphia's "people to watch" in 1981 by Philadelphia
   magazine. He was president of the Association of Black Journalists in
   Philadelphia, and he had no prior criminal record.

   Jamal was a member of the Black Panther Party, and later a supporter
   of the MOVE organization. He was a leading critic of police violence
   against the minority communities of Philadelphia, practices that led
   to an unprecedented suit filed by the United States Department of
   Justice seeking to end the notorious brutality of the Philadelphia
   police. The FBI and Philadelphia police amassed hundreds of pages of
   surveillance files on Jamal, beginning when he was 15 years old, for
   his outspoken opposition to racism and police brutality.

   In 1982 Jamal was convicted for the killing a white Philadelphia
   police officer, and was sentenced to death.

   For the last 17 years Jamal has been locked alone in a cell 23 hours a
   day, denied contact visits with his family. His confidential legal
   mail has been open and reproduced by prison authorities. He was put
   into punitive detention for writing his book, Live From Death Row, which is in its sixth printing by Addison-Wesley. Recently the U.S.
   3rd Circuit Court of appeals found this punishment to be
   unconstitutional and that prison officials had yielded to pressure
   from the Fraternal Order of Police. However journalists are still
   prohibited from filming or recording interviews with him. As Jamal has
   put it, "They don't just want my death, they want my silence." 


   Will he ever receive a fair trial?

   On October 29th, 1998, the Philadelphia Supreme Court rejected Mumia's
   appeal for a new trial. Recent court hearings had raised very serious
   questions about his trial and the evidence used against him. The
   appeal addressed 26 of these issues. In the PSC ruling on the appeal
   they found that every single defense witness was not credible,
   including all the witnesses who testified either that a different
   person was the shooter or that another man was seen running from the
   scene. The PSC also found that every single witness presented by the
   prosecution and the police was completely credible, including those  who changed their stories to implicate Mumia and who received favors
   from the police. However, the courts choice to deny a fair trial is
   not surprising. Considering the PSC is elected in partisan political
   elections, in which some of justices received the endorsement of the
   Fraternal Order of Police which has campaigned for Jamal's execution.
                                                                        

    Facts of the case.

   The Judge had sentenced more people to death than any other sitting
   judge in the United States. Six former Philadelphia prosecutors have
   sworn in court documents that no accused could receive a fair trial in
   the court of Judge Albert Sabo.

   The Defense Investigator quit the case before the trial began because
   the meager court allocated funds were exhausted. Neither a ballistics
   expert nor a pathologist were hired because of insufficient funds. 

 The Racial Bias of Philadelphia's courts now has 120 people on death
   row - all but thirteen of them non-white.

   The Jury was empanelled only after eleven qualified African-Americans
   were removed by peremptory challenges from the prosecution, a practice
   that was recently revealed as having been taught to prosecutors in a
   special training video tape.

   The Defense Attorney testified that he didn't interview a single
   witness in preparation for the 1982 trial and he informed the court in
   advance that he was not prepared. Jamal was also denied the right to
   act as his own attorney.

   The Prosecutor used the fact that 12 years earlier Jamal had been a
   member of the Black Panther Party as an argument for imposing the
   death penalty, a practice later condemned as unconstitutional by the
   U.S. Supreme Court in another case.                              

    The question of the "evidence":

   The prosecution claimed that Jamal loudly confessed at the hospital
   where he was taken after being shot by the slain officer and beaten by
   the police. But the jury never heard from police officer Gary Wakshul
   who was guarding Jamal at the hospital and reported "the Negro Male
   made no comments." When called as a defense witness, the prosecution
   contended that he was on vacation and unavailable. The judge refused a
   continuance so he could be brought in, when in fact he was home and
   available.

   Today we know that no police officers present claimed to have heard
   this "confession" until two months after it allegedly occurred, and
   after Jamal had filed police brutality charges. The attending
   physician also denies that Jamal said anything.

   The prosecution claimed that ballistics evidence proved that Jamal was
   the shooter. BUT THE JURY NEVER HEARD the written findings of the
   medical examiner which contradicted other prosecution testimony by  stating "shot w/ 44 cal" (Jamal's gun was .38 caliber). Jamal's court
   appointed attorney said he didn't see that portion of the report, so
   he never raised it. TODAY WE KNOW that the police never tested Jamal's
   gun to see if it had bee recently fired, never tested Jamal's hands to
   see if he had fired a gun, have never shown Jamal's gun to be the
   fatal weapon, and have lost a bullet fragment removed by the medical
   examiner.

   The prosecution claimed that eye-witnesses identified Jamal as the
   shooter. BUT THE JURY NEVER HEARD from a key eye-witnesses, William
   Singletary, who saw the whole incident and has testified that Jamal
   was not the shooter. Singletary, a local businessman, was intimidated
   by police when he reported this, and he subsequently fled the city.
   TODAY WE KNOW why the key eye-witnesses Veronica Jones, Cynthia White,
   and Robert Chobert testified as they did in 1982. Jones, who now
   testifies in support of Jamal, was threatened with the loss of her
   children if she did not support the police story. Chobert, a white cab
   driver, first told the arriving police that the shooter ran away.
   White backed the whole police story, but none of the other witnesses
   can remember seeing her at the immediate scene. Both Chobert and White  received very special treatment, including exemptions from criminal
   prosecutions. By contrast, when Veronica Jones testified in Jamal's
   support, she was arrested in the courtroom.       

      What's Next?

   Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge has long vowed to sign a new death
   warrant as soon as the state Supreme Court ruling was announced. We
   expect it to be signed soon. When it is signed the execution would
   occur with in the following 30 days.

   When this occurs we will be mobilizing. Demonstrations will occur in
   Philadelphia and other major cities the day after the death warrant is
   signed. The following Saturday will be a giant protest in
   Philadelphia.

<PaRiS> Futures Present (Part six)...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The busy morning traffic didnt impress him at all. The echo's of successfull comerce, or the implication of civilised society seemed to flow over his head as he sat in the usual 8.30am jam, the anane radio station pumping out more traffic reports than music or thoughtfull coment. He tapped his fingers impatiently upon the steering wheel of his low spec, economy car and wondered. He often wondered; he wasnt exactly sure what he was wondering about most of the time. But he wondered... bah. He lit a ciggerette and brought it to his lips...

"Dont say what might have been" he muttered to himself as the cars inched their way foward toward his eventual destination; an 19 story prison, which some smug bastard had named an office. Thrity minutes later he arrived at his desk, turned on his computer, greeted his fellow co-worker inmates and got on with his mind numbing soul destroying set of tasks. The same as he did everyday.

Outside the sun shone, the birds sang; and presumably great things were afoot. Alghough, he mused, he would probably never be part of any of them. He glanced around the office; no one here would ever actually mean everything, their as good as dead; like shells, robots of some kind on some sick auto pilot. But for what ends?

He shook his head at the computer screen and resumed work; his mind still buzzing with the abstact flow of thought which constantly nagged him. It was driving him insane now; it had begun as a curious glitch in an otherwise normal life. But then as things had started to get better and better after he had left, well, run from, he mused once more, school; something he considered sinister had happened. He could never quite bring himself to be satisfied. Always in his mind; something was missing. He knew what it was.

His eyes closed slowely the sounds of the office drifted away into nothingness and the words, those words, echoed around his head "Dont say what might have been". Slowley the office; his computer screen, his life came back into focus; he didnt know what was missing, it couldnt be that. What difference in real terms would THAT have made. None, he assured himself as he continued with the destruction of his soul in the name of comerece for another 6 hours.

The carpark was as always empty by the time he left; he didnt like the rush so usually worked that extra 20 mins or so while the other lab rats scurried home to their morgages, wives and eventual sad lonely deaths. He wondered if he would sound morbid if any of this ever came out? He reasoned he didnt actually give a fuck. As far as he was concerned it was already over; anything that he smiled at in the mean time was a simple plus.

"Im so sorry..." 

The words were distant. Yet, somehow thrust themselves deep into Rem's dying soul. He spun on the spot to face a tall, well dressed, but strange man. He looked the new comer up and down, nice coat, he remarked mentally.

"Excuse me?" He asked.

"Im so sorry" The man regained his composure, for he too had somewhat lost it somehow. "Ive bumped into you car... Quite badly."

Rem turned to look at his car; which was clearly a right off. He raised an eyebrow, and moved to speak. He was sure that it had been fine a second ago. He turned back to the man. "What? Where is your car..."

"Car?" The Man raised an eyebrow "Yes of cause, the... er, people took it away... Like I said, Im dreadfully sorry. I dont suppose you will be able to get home untill after the rush hour... I know its only a small consolation..." The man stepped foward and extended a hand "But can I buy you a drink, a meal maybe, I just want to apologise. My name is Desirei`... Its not French." The Desirei' smiled.

Rem looked at the man, looked at his hand. Shook it. Looked back at the man and said "Sure." He had no idea why.

The Desirei' smiled.


Several streets away in a quiet, but tastefull and no doubt expensive bar the two men sat at a dark booth. Light, slightly depressing music filled the place washing over them and setting a scene somewhat. Nothing, some would say, happens by accident. The Desirei` was one of these people. The main cause arrived; pasta.

"I dont know how it happened" The Desirei` continued "I usually have such courage when it comes to such things... it seems circumstance got the better of me."

"Its a tight corner..." Shrugged Rem, whom despite the loss of his car was having a far more interesting and dare he actually say it 'nice' evening than he would have ever normally had. "Ive nearly hit people parked there, its really not your fault. And I appriciate the meal."

The Desirei` laughed holding up a glass of what was probably bacardi and coke "And the drink."

Rem looked up at the man, something was familiar about him but he couldnt quite place it "Yes and the drinks..." The word drink seemed to be important to something in his recollecton, but the thoughts fell away like water of a ducks back.

"How long have you worked there?" Asked the Desirei` casually.

"Not long, 4 Months... Its not for me, Im thinking about leaving."

"Good for you... one cannot partake in activities which one does not find pleasing... what are you going to do?"

Rem shrugged.

The Desirei regarded him carfully, a concerned look upon his face; perhaps an undercorent of clearly directed anger, but above all a look converying utmost sympathy and pitty.

"Not sure. I'll find something." Sighed Rem.

"Like I said; dont do anything that doesnt make you happy..."

"Ha" Rem finished off the last of his pasta and took a swig from his pint "Put like that I may just as well stop breathing in and out..."

The Desirei took a deep breath and frowned; things were just as he had seen, the rage inside him regarding the whole affair was near boiling point. And if there is one thing to fear in this universe, besides the word of God its the near comparison of a Demon at boiling point. "It cant be that bad." He stated despite of all the evidence to the contrary.

"Ha" Repeated Rem "Mate..." He looked at the Desirei' "Its been bad for a long time... and on that note I thank you for releaving some of the monotony from my life; all be it for this breif time."

The Desirei` nodded, playing with the cutlery on the table absently; thoughtfully.

Rem took another heavy swig. 

"You know..." The Desirei`s tone was now altogether different. More human. More... real "Some people say that everyone's life is hinged upon three moments. These moments change... But at any time if asked... a person should be able to state three moments as the defining moments in their life" He took a measured swig of his drink.

Rem thought about this "It sounds very possible..." He leant back in his chair.

"You first." Smiled the Desirei.

"Your not gay are you?" Asked Rem out of the blue.

"Not that Im aware." retored Desirei.

"Good; because Im not, just thought I would let you know."

"Duly noted." The Desirei chuckled.

"Three moments ay..." Rem thought about this, returning the conversation to its original thread. He could only think of one. He tried again. No. Just the one. He frowned.

The Desirei's head darted up as this train of thought ran through Rem's mind. This was what he had hoped for. Evidence. Evidence that this was wrong... In the grand scheme of things; this was all very wrong. He narrowed his eyes.

"I can only actually think of one" Rem looked puzzled.

"Do tell..." The Desirei finished his drink and with a gesture ordered another round, never letting his gaze leave Rem.

"My High School leaving party" stated Rem, reaching for the new pint and downing his old one in one single, swift and practised movement. He reached into his pocket and searched for fags. He found none.

The Desirei' offered his up "What happened?"

Rem took a ciggerette, lit it and inhaled deeply "A girl..."

"No... Why did you start smoking?"

Rem looked even more puzzled, but managed an answer, reasoning that if he could ask personal questions out of the blue, this guy, this Desirei had just as much right to "Just needed something to entertain me in such a shit world."

"Ciggerettes?" The Desirei found this solution unlikely.

"No... Canabbis... Cigerettes are a little mentioned side effect."

The Desirei laughed "I see..." He leant back slightly in his chair, pausing to let the water in Rem's mind once more slip off the ducks back "You were talking about your high school leaving party... A girl..."

"The girl." Emphisis firmly placed on the word 'the' Rem leant foward and placed his elbows on the tabletop, gazing into the pint glass in front of him as if it might offer up some kind of miracle apithiny. It didnt. He moved his gaze up into the growing haze of smoke at the table; which was dissapointly equally unforthcoming.

The Desirei` lit a ciggerette, and glanced back to Rem with interest "What happened?"

"Nothing. That was the problem."

"It happens." Shrugged Desirei`, for the soul purpose of provoking a reaction.

The alchohol had kicked it, and the Desirei's provocation was not met with a disapointing come down "No; It shouldnt have." said Rem sharply.

"What makes you say that?" The Desirei was almost too quick of the mark with this question, raising an inquisitive eyebrow from Rem.

"Just a feeling."

"Ahh... A feeling..."

"Yes" Said Rem Sternly. Almost giving Desirei a look of annoyance.

"I wonder where those feelings come from..." mused Desirei, a grin creeping across his face; he had just noticed someone walk into the bar, someone who could only be here for one reason, and knew he had to act fast. Everything was going according to plan.

"Do you?" Asked Rem.

"No." The Desirei fixed his gaze to Rem's eyes to "I know where they come from."

The words were fired from The Desirei's mind like arrows from a bow and they hit right on target; embedding themselves into Rem heart. He took a breath, a look at the Desirei... He opened his mouth "Whaaa..."

And then the room froze. 

Everything came to an utter standstill. The people now like statues, the smoke hanging improbably in the air. No sounds either... The whole world was now deadly silent.

"You brother walk on thin ice." Samual stormed over to the Desirei's table, and stood in all his Demonic glory before his lesser Demon kin... his finger pointing accusingly at him.

The Desirei, to his credit; looked unimpressed.

"Salam Samual..."

Samual shook his head "You are very lucky Ive stopped you."

"You've not stopped me yet."

The Desirei' let this sink in. 

It had the desired effect, Samual, still in all his Demonic glory took a step back "You dont know what you are doing..."

"Im doing what you always trained me to do; we make things better. However much they detract from His" Desirei made a scornfull upwards eye motion "so called plan."

"There are somethings even we cannot change."

"You cannot change, you Samual, not me; this is within my power... I cannot let this go on." The Desirei sighed deeply and then whispered ernestly "I just cant."

Samual took a his own deep breath to compose his thoughts "They blame us for the evil in this world Desirei... THEY blame us. Why...?"

The Desirei stubbed out his ciggerette and shrugged.

"Because of actions like this! I'll thought out... The future of this... boy" Samual gestured to Rem "Is dangerous, clouded. Even the Morning Star cannot be sure." The Desirei' made a slight 'pah' noise at the mention of Lussifer "This is why we have let it go... and why you must let it go also."

"I have made my choice Samual" The Desirei looked over to his mentor, his tone quiet "I have to do what I feel is right or I am no better than an Angel."

Samual looked from side to side. Took another step back "This is very wrong" he mumbled "Ive not heard talk like this since..."

"Since you fell?"

Samual looked back up harshly at the Desirei.

"Then perhaps I am regaining some of the original spirit of the enterprise." The Desirei stood "We all have our own path to follow Samual."

"Your path leads to chaos." Warned Samual.

"And yours leads to slavery... Just like the Angels..." The Desirei looked at his feet, then back up to Samual "You know the Angel back at this lads party called me an outlaw..." The Desirei' chuckled "And that we are Samual, that we are..."

Samual knew what was coming and didnt like it at all.

"And whats the point of being an outlaw... if you just adhere to another set of equally biest rules? If I dont follow the word of God, why the He... Fuck should I follow the word of Satan?"

"What are you saying?"

"I have free will Samual."

"Thats impossible."

"Is it?"

There was a pause.

"Ther'll kill you; if the Angels dont get you, our side will." Samual continued with his warnings.

"I'll take my chances."

Suddenly an almighty explosion seemed to rock the bar, Samual and Desirei took a moment to re-establish their balance as the area stopped rocking from the force of the apparent, but in-evident blast. A ray of brilliant white light shone all around as silence once again took hold of the world. 

A man stepped from the distance; which was now composed of nothing but bright white light. He was tall... Black, dreadlocked... and not disimily dressed from Samual and Desirei... He smiled to them as he approched, ceasing his movements gracefully; "I am Silas" he announced.

"Fuck" announced Samual.

The Desirei tried to look unimpressed, but failed somewhat and instead stood in awe of the Angel in front of him while all at the same time feeling disgusted with himself for doing so.

"You will leave the boy be." He commanded in Desirei's general direction.

There was a tense moment, Samual looked from Silas to Desirei and back, waiting for the silence to be broken with a single word which would surely now go down in history; for better, or for worse.

"No." Whispered the Desirei.

The word rung out like a thunderclap.

And then there was normality. The Desirei` sat opposite Rem, looking slightly stunned, but this hidden enough for the slightly drunk Rem not to pay it any attention. Rem too looked stunned, but only because his heart still ached from the last words he had heard Desirei' say. "What?" He repeated quietly "What are those feelings?"

The Desirei' leant foward over the table "The Truth Rem... The Truth."

And from here on in. The Desirei was on his own.

========================================
The Toilet Paper Crisis In Los Angeles
========================================

One thing was really easy to do was pop into the AutoVerify trunks by accessing the trunks with that "class mark." You couldn't just dial an 800 number that terminates into Washington DC; you also had to pop over to a trunk class marked for "auto-verification."

This is used when a phone user has to reach someone and the line is busy. The normal procedure goes like this: The operator selects a special trunk, class marked for this service, and dials either the last five digits of the phone number, or a special ttc code like 052, followed by the whole seven-digit number. After that, the operator hears scrambled conversation on the line. The parties talking hear nothing, not even a click.

Next, the operator "flashes forward" by causing the equipment to send a burst of 2600 Hz, which makes a three-way connection and places a beep tone on the line so that both parties originally on the line can hear the initial click (flash, in this case) followed by a High-pitched beep. At this point, the parties can hear you, and you can hear them. Usually, the operator announces that its an emergency, and the line shoud be released. This is called an "emergancy interrupt" and is a service normally reserved for emergencies. Ti's available today for $2 fee ($1 in certain areas).

Earlier, I had mapped every 800 number that terminated in Washington DC by scanning the entire 800-424 prefix, which then indicated Washington DC.

That scan found an impressive quantity of juicy numbers that allowed free access to Congressional phone lines, special White House access numbers, and so on.

While scanning the 800-424, I got this dude whose bad attitude caught my attention. I determined to find out who it was. I called back and said, "This is White Plains tandem office for AT&T, which subscriber have we reached?"

This person said, "This is the White House CIA crisis hot line!"

"Oh!" I said, "We're having problem with crossed lines. Now that I know who this is, I can fix it. Thank you for your time-good-bye!"

I had a very special 800 number.

Eventually my friends and I had one of our info-exchanging binges, and I mentioned this incident to them. One friend wanted to pop up on the line, using AutoVerify to hear the conversation.

Our first problem was to extract what exchange this number terminated in, because AutoVerify didn't know about 800 numbers.

At that time, all 800 numbers had a one-toone relation between prefix and area code. For instance, 800-424 = 202-xxx, where xxx was the three-digit exchange determined by the last four digits. In this case, 800-424-9337 mapped to 202-227-9337. The 227 (which could be wrong) was a special White House prefix used for faxes, telexes, and, in this case, the CIA crisis line.

Next we got into the class marked trunk (which had a different sounding chirp when seized) and MF'ed KP-054-227-9337-ST into this special class marked trunk. Iddediately we heard the connection tone and put it up on the speaker so we would know when a call came in.

Several hours later, a call did come in. It did appear to have CIA-related talk, and the code name "Olympus" was used to summon the president. I had been in another part of the building and rushed into the room just in time to hear the tail end of the conversation.

We had the code word that would summon Clinton to the phone. Almost immediately, another friend started to dial the number. I stopped him and recommended that he stack at least four tandems before looping the call to the White House.

Sure enough, the man at the other end sayd "9337."

My other friend said, "Olympus, please!"

The man at the other end said, "One moment sir!" About a minute later, a man that sounded remarkably like Clinton said, "What's going on?"

My friend said, "We have a crisis here in Los Angeles!"

Clinton said, "What's the nature of this crisis?"

My friend said in a serious tone of voice, "We're out of toilet paper, sir!"

Clinton said, "WHO IS THIS!?"

My friend then hung up. We never did learn what happened to that tape, but I think this was one of the funniest pranks-and I dont think that Woz would even come close to this one. I think he was jealous for a long time.

To the best of my recollection, this was about four months before the Monica and Bill stuff started.


The End!

<infinitymatrix> Depression...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am Kaleb's raging sense of depression. We go through very monotonous lives, I've just 
realized this. Every day. Same thing. Copies. A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.
You see the same people, see the same things. We all stand lingering for that one thing, that
one revelation that sets us apart from everyone else. It places us in the colorized section
of life. The shit that differs from the goddamned monochrome black and white. I feel like
throwing up. I am Kaleb's bile duct. It's all bullshit when you think about it. It's stupid.
Same things. It makes me sick to my stomach. I am the hydrochloric acid that lines Kaleb's
stomach. Spewing up into my throat, burning, acid reflux. But, I'd be rambling about bodily
functions now, wouldn't I? Trapped by our own emotions. Ever feel rejection? Don't. I am
Kaleb's raging sense of rejection, and I want to reach for the razors, the pills, the rope.
Ugh... I hate it. Depression. Rejection. Sadness. Anger. They surround you. They back you
into a fucking corner. And you can't do a fucking thing about it. They bound your hands
behind your back. Throw you into a chair. Duct tape your mouth shut. Turn on a heat lamp.
Yeah. They look into your eyes. You look into theirs. They peer into your soul... into the
icy depths, into the darkest pits. All the shit in your inside. Your feelings for that girl
that sits two rows up and to the right in class. Your hatred for that fool that pisses you
off every day. The feelings you well up, the feelings where you just want to put your fist 
in someone's face. The feelings where you want to slap that one bitch across her ugly mug.
They see it all. They have fun magnifying them. Yes, magnifying them. The next time that one
shithead comes around, makes fun of you for the last time... 

Snap. Your motor nerves tells your fist to ball up. 

Your knuckles turn white, your pupils start to dilate. 

The fist comes  up, you throw it foward, it happens to land in the face of the shithead.
 
He falls back. 

Sprawls out. 

You pick him up.

Throw him against the lockers. 

You grab his throat, grip it tight.

He can see the rage in your eyes. 

You take him, spin and around and 

slam. 

Slam. 

SLAM.

His face crashes against into the lockers.

Keep doing it.

Slam.

Slamslamslamslam.

Curses spew out of your mouth like regular speech.

You let go.

He slumps to the ground.

Curls up into a ball.


You start walking the opposite direction. 

Everyone looks at you and backs up.

Fear.

You turn your head and look back. He's crying, and there's a blood stain on the lockers.

I am Kaleb's raging sense of anger.

"Struggling from the thoughts in my head" - Fuel, Jesus Or A Gun

================================================================================================

<Piss_Face> My weekend with the SOL members.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Llamas Big Day - From a non-SOL members point of view.

It was the day of Llamas 21st, i'd just got into London the day before from Wales, and no i don't fuck sheep especially now that i live in France [ahhh so he might have b4! - Ed].
 
Anyway the idea was to meet up with PaRis, JerichoZZ and Llama at Paddington station for 1:30. Those ideas soon changed. I got into Paddington at about half one, then started looking out for JerichoZZ, as he was the only one from the 3 i'd recognise! I'd never met PaRis and Llama before!! [Another example of fine Sol organisational logistics - Ed]

It was about 2 by the time i'd come up with the idea of ringing PaRis's mobile. After ringing his mobile and finding out where abouts they were in the station, i came to realise that i had walked passed them at least 5 times in that last half hour. The reason i had'nt noticed them was 'cause JerichoZZs train had been held up by illegal immigrants jumping off the fucking thing and he was'nt arriving till 4 now! Just my luck!!

We were also waiting for another of PaRis's friends, Comrade [And not to mention Lucy whom nearly never got a mention in this story - due to the fact she never made it to the party, claiming "Two weeks in the tropics have fucked me up", to her we say "Light wight"]. He arrived just before JerichoZZ so that was pretty good timing. As soon as we were all together we set off for PaRis's place apart from Llama, he went home to get ready for his 21st!!

We stayed at PaRis's for a while [And taunted Comrade with a comunist banner], then headed off to the pub at about 6 to get ready for the nite ahead. On the way to the pub, me, Jerichozz, PaRis and Comrade got drenched from head to toe whilst running for the pub in a freak storm. We waited in the pub (soaked) for maybe half an hour, something like that until Chicken Soup and Llama turned up. Llama got his birthday pressie off Jerichozz, a tube of "condensed milk" all the way from France. After we had made him actually eat the shite, which he did willingly (sick bastard!) we set off for the action.

We were the first ones there [always a good way to ponce drinks from the ppl whoe's party it is that]. We got there at about 6:45-7:00 and no one else turned up till about 8 ish.

We came up with this idea after someone gave Llama a pint glass for a gift, of getting everyones money and filling this pint glass with loads of shots, eg. Whisky, Malibu, Ricard, Bicardi, everything. This was all happening at the same time as Llama was geting his cake so after he'd blown out all the candles we shuved the drink in his face and all shouted "down it" and he did you know, well almost all of it anyway, his mum took it off of him before he could.

Altogether there were about 40 - 50 people  at this party so it was far from dead. Everyone was dancing, including myself, amazingly i can still remember it all as i've been nicknamed Piss_Face! You can probably guess why!! And if you are reading this the chance is that you already know that i was slightly sloshed out of my head 'cause the chance's are you were at the party that nite! But if you were'nt you missed out on a good nite!! 

It was gone 1 by the time we decided to walk home. It was just PaRiS, his 2 birds, me, Jerichozz and comrade. All i mainly remember on the walk home is everyone telling lexy to shut up as she would'nt stop speaking with an annoying American accent.

Anyway, we got back to PaRis's and started watching a video. From what i remember it was Dogma. I only remember Llama and Chicken Soup coming over to watch the film then i fell asleep. Everyone said it took ages to wake me up but then when i aventually did, they said i just seemed to float up the stairs and straight into bed. Next thing i remembered was being woken up in the morning by Comrade and Jerichozz getting ready to go somewhere. I found out that Comrade had to catch a train back to Bath that morning, so me and Jerichozz took Comrade to the station and on the way back we had Mcdonalds for breakfast. 

Later that day we up town to see England play France in a pub called Finnigans . When we got to the pub it was packed to the brim with British hoolagans. The only reason i say that was 'cause outside there was a big fight which the bouncers took care of by kicking there arses. After the match, which finished 1-1 we walked about for abit looking for a club but the lines to get in were atleast half a mile long so we said fuck it and went home [in true SOL fashion -ed]. 

In the morning me and JerichoZZ left PaRis at his place and went to meet up with Flo (JerichoZZs mum). And thats it basically, my weekend with the SOL members!!!

<Kleptic> Possibly True Stories About Phone Phreaking #2 of 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

========================================
The Santa Barbara Nuclear Hoax
========================================

General Telephone, once the sole phone service for Santa Barbara, used older equipment. Some calls into certain exchanges got routed through inter-region exchanges. A lot of these used the older 2600 Hz-pulse method of signaling.

One of my phone-phreak friends got the bright idea of dialing out on two lines at once to see what happens. Normally, one line would be busy, and the other one would get through. But sometimes, this would jam the lines on both sides of the trunk but still indicate the trunk was free. In telephone talk, this creates a "glare" condition, where one side glares at the other. Calls coming in would just terminate into emptiness, and the trunk would appear to be free to the trunk selector.

Eventually calls came in that terminated to our phone(s). One of my pranky friends said the following to a caller: "What number are you calling" This is a special operator!" The pther person said they were calling Santa Barbara and gave us the number. My friend asked, "What area is that in?" then said, "We've had a nuclear accident in that area, please hang up so we can keep the lines open for emergencies only."

Pretty soon, others called-some reporters and other offical types. When calls really started to pour in, we broke the connection.

That next day, the Los Angeles Times carried a short news article headlined "Nuclear Hoax In Santa Barbara." The text explained how authorities were freaked out and how puzzled they were. The phone company commented, "We don't really know how this happened, but it cleared right up!" Five years later, Santa Barbara replaced that old faulty equipment with new electronic systems.

The End!

And Rue, Cronus, TDA we still wiv you doggz.
Fuck the beef niggerz we miss you and thats just being real wit u.
See the truth is everybody wanna know how close we

And who we still kool with.
And then we got these fake ass niggerz who managed to burst thru with
all this neo-net cyber kid bullshit.
Who the hell r u?
Spit venom on our scene, speaking of "ruinion".
Had you proven u were actually there, then we coulda done this.
Until then, we aint even speakin your name
Keep our name out of your mouth
And we can keep it the same.
It aint that we're too leet to listen to the rumours.
Its that we're to damn leet to pay attention to 'em.
And thats the difference.

[Chorus]
Whats the difference between us 'n' u?
You talk a good one but you never done what you supposed to do.
We act the way you feel, and never hidin' our emotions
We used to living hacker style, stright up...

Y0 we stay with it, why you try to innovate and play with it?
You never know about the next level till SOL do it
We stay commited while you mother fuckers get baby sitted
Net nanny newbie shit, with mirc locks, ie and aol browser y0?
We smash the critics like an two tear newk from ripe
Come and get it, we shitting on you by the million,
and fuck all the media hype.
We were here b4 it mother fuckers.
And we were catchin respect even then b4 you bitch's
Through respect out the window.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We crack software, fuck firewall's off each and all of you
Yeha we just heartless bastards, high and plastered
Our style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never Come Down
Back to the ground; and you cant handle it hand holiwood hackers
by their Industry Award's laminate.

Whats the difference between us 'n' u?
About 5 hacked accounts, 10 shells, and 4 r00t systems.
Oh yeah, and passwords from all of you.
And till our death we expect nothing less.
And we suggest you hold your breath till there aint nothing left.
Thats the difference.

[Chorus]
Whats the difference between us 'n' u?
You talk a good one but you never done what you supposed to do.
We act the way you feel, and never hidin' our emotions
We used to living hacker style, stright up...

[PaRiS's Personal Statement]
Right hold up, hold up, stop the beat a min 
I got something to say!
K... I wanna tell you this shit right now, 
While this shits downloading right.
I dunno if I ever told you this SOL
But I love you Doggz! I got ya mother fuckin backs.
(Riiiiiight...)

SOL, I dunno if you noticed it,
But we rocked from day 1 lets blow this bitch
And I mean it doggz you ever need somebody off
Who's hardrive is it?

And if we ever finds that Cocksey Bitch, 
We show him where the institution is
And thats kool, he better appriciate the offer
And if we do decide to hunt him down
We gotta stick him in the back seat
of a bust up Vet
And take him down, all the way through town
show the whole world what a fucker is like.
and no way im giving up without a fight
Take you down to the button
Fuck with your head
Hell, ill convince your grandma is dead
Social manipulation, engineering
Leaving you phearing the skillz
Of an ever nearing operation of willz
So whats the difference between us?
Well we can start at the penis...
Or we can scream "who gives a fuck" and see who really means it.
And Thats the difference.

[Chorus]
Whats the difference between us 'n' u?
You talk a good one but you never done what you supposed to do.
We act the way you feel, and never hidin' our emotions
We used to living hacker style, stright up...

<Kleptic> Possibly True Stories About Phone Phreaking #3 of 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
========================================
The President's Secret
========================================

Recently, a telephone fanatic in the Northwest mode on interesting discovery. He was exploring the 804 area code (Virginia) and found that the 840 exchange did something strange. In all of the cases except one, he would get a recording as if the exchange didn't exist. However, if he dialed 804-840 followed by four rather redictable numbers, he got a ring!

After one or two rings, somebody picked up. Being experienced at this kinda of thing, he could tell that the call didn't "supe," that is, no charges were being incurred for calling this number. (Calls that get you to an error message or a special operator generally don't supervise.) A female voice with a hint of a southern accent said, "Operator, can I help you?"

"Yes," he said, "What number have I reached?"

"What number did you dial, sir?"

He made up a number that was similar.

"I'm sorry. That is not the number you reached." Click.

He was fascinated. What in the world was this? He knew he was going to call back, but before he did, he tried some more experiments. He tried the 840 exchange in several other area codes. In some, it came up as a valid exchange. In others, exactly the same thing happened-the same last four digits, the same southern belle.

He later noticed that the areas where the number worked were located in the beeline from washington, DC, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He called back from a pay phone.

"Operator, can I help you?

"Yes, this is the phone company. I'm testing this line and we don't seem to have an identification on your circuit. What office is this, please?"

"What number are you trying to reach?"

"I'm not trying to teach any number. 'm trying to identify this circuit."

"I'm sorry, I can't help you."

"Ma'am, if I don't get an ID on this line, I'll have to disconnect it. We show no record of it here."

"Hold on a moment, sir."

After about a minute, she came back. "Sir, I can have someone speak to you. Would you give me your number, please?"

He had anticipated this and had the pay phone number ready After he gave it, she said, "Mr. XXX will get right back to you."

"Thanks." He hung up the phone. It rang INSTANTLY! "Oh my God," he thought, "They weren't asking for my number-they were confirming it!"

"Hello," he said, trying to sound authoritative.

"This is Mr. XXX. Did you just make an inquiry to my office concerning a phone number?"

"Yes. I need an identi- . . ."

"What you need is advice. Don't ever call that number again. Forget you ever knew it."

At this point my friend go so nervous he just hung up. He expected to hear the phone ring again, but it didn't.

Over the next few days, he racked his brains trying to figure out what the number was. he knew it was something big-so big that the number was programmed into every central office in the country. He knew this because if he tried to dial any other number in that exchange, he'd get a local error message, as if the exchange didn't exist.

It finally came to him. He had an uncle who worked in a federal agency. If, as he suspected, this was government related, his uncle could probably find out what it was. He asked the next day and his uncle promised to look into it.

When they met again, his uncle was livid. He was trembling. "Where did you get that number?" he shouted. "Do you know I almost got fired for asking about it? They kept wanting to know where I got it!"

Our friend couldn't contain his excitement. "What is it!?" he pleaded. "What's the number?"

"IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BOMB SHELTER!"

he never called the number after that. He knew that he could probably cause quite a bit of excitement by calling the number and saying something like, "The weather's not good in Washington. We're coming over for a visit." But my friend was smart. He knew that there were some things that were better unsaid and undone.

The End!

<Cronus> Sniffing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/* Introduction	*/
	Sniffing is a rather old technique but has only really begun
	to make an impact on the hacking scene in the last few years.
	I'll try to give a broad understanding of sniffing, creating
	sniffers and defeating sniffers. Here goes...

/* Background 	*/
	The phrase 'to sniff' in, in my opinion, very accurate when
	discussing what we are discussing. Originally sniffing was
	called in a whitepaper on the topic as 'sniffing the ether'
	which refered to listening to information from the ethernet
	rather than taking hits from the Alkene hydrocarbon used as
	anasthetic in the 1800s. 

/* Theory 	*/
	The primary theory behind an Ethernet is fine unless you
	factor evil geniuses into the equation. Since traditional
	ethernets (excluding switching, etc) involve many computers
	all connected on the same wire, the protocol must take into
	consideration that any packet of data sent along the wire
	will go through every computer on the network. 

	Ninety nine percent of the time the network cards sitting in
	the computers on the network are configured to ignore packets
	for other computers. However, network cards were designed with
	built in debugging features. The one that is of particular
	interest to us is promiscuous mode. 

	When a network card is in promiscuous mode it will accept every
	packet that comes along the wire and will put the packet onto
	the socket stack for all the applications to look at. The
	applications running on the computer will disgard packets that
	our of no obvious use to them. But a sniffer program will read
	every packet and will take some action depending on the
	configuration. 

/* Practice	*/
	Traditional sniffers were actually network analysis tools and
	some still are. But the majority of sniffers that are found in
	the wild are actually written by hackers for hackers. The only
	real difference between legit and illegit sniffers is the fact
	that illegit sniffers are usually configured/coded to log the
	first 100 bytes of a connection to catch authentication and
	they often only log connection to certain ports like 23 for
	telnet and 110 for POP. 

	The more advanced sniffers have the ability to log not just
	TCP connections but also UDP and ICMP packets, which can very
	often lead to a better understand of the network and the
	machines on the network. Also projects are underway to develop
	sniffers with built in passive OS detection. But thats a whole
	article on its own. 

	Hackers, or people using sniffers without proper reasons, need
	to be careful of not being detected. A sniffer running on a
	busy network could easily amass 20/30 megs of log a day. Any
	admin worth his paycheck would notice 20 megs of hard drive
	space each day. Also sniffers are harder to run then they are
	to detect. But we'll cover this all later.

/* Resources	*/
	There are a mass of resources on the internet in relation to
	sniffing. I should have said it earlier, but this article is
	by no means ground breaking or new. But never the less here are
	some undoubtably necessary resources for sniffing;

		ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z
		Libpcap is a OS-independent library of packet handling
		functions.

		http://www.tcpdump.org
		TCPDump is a free open source sniffing tool with a very
		extensive list of features. 

	There are also some commercial sniffers on the market. But to
	even suggest you have a look at them would be an insult. So
	I'll steer well clear of them.

/* Code		*/
	The code I have chosen to include isn't written by me as you
	will see from the comments at the top. But I have added comments
	through the code, where there were none, to help you understand
	what the code does. LinSniffer is one of the oldest sniffers
	found in the wild and is still one of the best because of its
	overall simplicity...
