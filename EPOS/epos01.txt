  epos (one) editorial by monk

       Hello all, welcome to epos electronic magazine issuse one.  I can't 
  begin to express my joy that someone is reading this.

       In case you were wondering, epos means 'epic song' in latin.  It did
  sound nice so it stuck.

       After going through a couple hundred issues of various magazines such
  as Jonas, rice, dto, pong, cDc and many others I came to a conclusion about
  what kind of zine epos should be.  90% of the zines I went through had, one
  way or another, some roots in the underground art/warez scene.  Which made
  me sick to my stomach.  However, zines like Jonas and dto were different. 

       I finally came to the conclusion that zines related to computer stuff
  just plain suck and not even I would read them (and i'll read anything :).
  So, with that in mind, I decided to pattern epos after the very successful
  Jonas, released by Edicus.  Now I am not saying that I am copying anything
  of his, far from it.  I am simply saying that the articles that he puts in
  are of great varieties different genres.  I decided to do the same.  The
  same thing being said over and over again by adolescent punks gets boring
  after a while, a very short while.
  
       I write because I like to write.  Not to please a certain group of
  people and not to gain popularity amoung a certain group of people.  If
  one person reads what I write and enjoys it, and continues reading further
  issues, I am overjoyed.  I'm not looking to make money, I'm not looking to
  be the best, I'm looking to have fun, and to allow an open medium for other
  people who enjoy writing like myself to have fun as well.  That is what
  epos is about, the joy of writing, no matter how good or bad it is.
 
       Oh, umm, everything in here is written by me, maybe someone else will
  join the crew, but for now, it's just me.

   1.0.1 - I'm seeing things for the first time 

      I suppose if life were to be devided up into sections, it would have
  to be broken up so a section would equal 5.5 years.  A small example of
  what I mean.

   5.5 : School starts, to young to be immature, innocent.
   11 : Beginning to look up to older people (14-16), adolescent path chosen
   16.5 : driving, group of friends made, start in more on chosen path
   22 : drinking, end or middle of college, making big descisions

      I'll stop there, mainly since I don't know many people personally that
  are over 22, other than my parents.  I'm 16 now, but go to college and have
  a lot of skater friends that are older.

      I wrote this simply as a means of awareness to others bout my age who
  might be wondering what other 14-20 year olds are doing, and what path that
  I have chosen.

      More and more kids round fourteen to fifteen are getting on the net
  these days.  Now thats not a problem, but the problem is that a lot of those
  stupid punk kids are bringing their stupid elitist additues with them.  If
  you want an example of what im talking about, go on irc.  It seems that
  such time is being wasted on pirating software then time spent learning and
  doing something constructive.  It's not that big of a deal since most of
  the kids round this age think computers are for nerds anyway, and wouldn't
  go within 20 feet of one.  Don't wanna lose popularity.  However, I suppose
  that kind of immature stupidity is natural, I went through it, so did most
  everyone else.  Thats not to say there aern't some cool little guys out
  there.  Just the other day I met up with a thirteen year old skater who's
  already talking about his own skate company.

      What about us older guys you might ask?  Well, I hate to say it, but
  some people never grow up.  A couple of my old friends from middle school
  ran into me yesterday.  One of them dropped out to afford his car, pot and
  beer, he also grew his hair out another 6 inches :)  One of the other guys
  whom I used to skate with all the time decided school was to boring for
  him and decided to drop out as well, he left home and is living with a
  friend in an apartment.

      Some things never change.

      I personally would love to hear from someone round my age who is doing
  ANYTHING worthwile.  I'm getting so sick of punks who are going nowhere. I
  would like to start my own clothing line actually.  I draw quite a bit and
  if anyone would like to co-op with me on something I think it'd be cool.

       What about you monk?  Well, im homeschooled so I don't have many time
  limits on what I can and cant do.  I'm taking college courses at a local
  college and skate every day religously.  Like I said, I'm hoping to start
  my own clothing line (nothing special, hats/tee's stuff like that) for fun.
  Who knows, maybe someone will wanna do the same.  I play the guitar and
  sing and wanna find a band someday.  Oh well, im mumbling, I'll just end it
  at this.  My grungie generation of gangsters and punks is really brining me
  down.  PLEASE write to me if you feel the same :) 

 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   1.0.2 - Nothing can stop me now, cause I dont care, Anymore.

      Over the past 4 years I have avoided doing a lot of things that I would
  have really liked to do.  One of them was to finally work on my zine.

    Why did you do that?

      Fact is, I cared more about what people would think about me then what
  I really wanted to do.  It wasn't exactly a gradual thing, my transformation
  from the paranoid hermit to who I am now.

      I would have to say the song 'piggy' by nine inch nails really turned me
  around.  Changed my life even.  I've had my share of embarassments in the
  past, but not many, to avoid embarassment I would dissapear.

    No more hiding.

      I still am a reserved individual, don't talk much, keep to myself.
  However, in the past, typing my feelings for others to hear would have been
  unheard of.

    Until I stoped caring.

      It's not worth pondering over one fools stupid comment.  Get on with
  what you love, the rewards of one constructive comment for a hard work
  overpower the comments of fools 1000 times.

 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   2.0.1 - 311, 311

      Well, I have to admit I haven't ever listened to any of the previous
  311 albums before this one, I dont even like rap/jazz/funk.  This cd has
  totally changed all that.

      The first thing I noticed about the entire sound of 311 is the aditude
  of the album.  60% of my cd collection consists of cd's that complain and
  wine about everything, so depressing.  311 really changed my whole outlook
  on music, its uplifting, strong, very well composed and all the songs don't
  sound the same.

      Songs like 'All Mixed Up', 'Don't Stay Home' and 'Jackolantern's
  Weather' really stand out.

      If you don't wanna get it cause you didn't like the song 'down' which
  video is played all the time (I actually think it's a cool video), get it
  anyway.  I'll bet you'll find something else on the cd you'll like.

 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   2.0.2 - MOM (Music For Our Mother Ocean), Various Artists 

      MOM is a benefit album for the Surfrider Foundation based in California.
  It's a group dedicated to protecting and preserving the world's oceans,
  waves and beaches through conservation, activism, research and education.
  If you want to contact them give a ring to (800)743-SURF.

      Anyway, on to the review.  First thing that caught my eye was the cool
  cd case/cover, really nice cover/back art.  A lot of big groups such as
  Pearl Jam, The Ramones, Pennywise, Soundgarden and Everclear just to name
  a few contributed to the cd.  Pearl Jam, The Ramones, Silverchair, Gary
  Hoey and Pennywise did their own versions of old Beach Boys and other
  old beach songs which all turned out pretty nice.  I especially liked the
  Brian Setzer's Orchestra version of 'Honky Tonk'.  A lot of the time when
  albums containing a lot of diffrent groups is released it ends up coming
  out pretty bad sounding.  Not MOM, every single song on it rocks, on my
  top 10 list of my favorite cd's ever.

      I can't really pick out any songs that I especially liked since I liked
  them all equally :) However I would have to say that 7mary3's 'blackwing'
  was really well composed and having not heard much of their stuff before,
  got me to go out and buy 'American Standard' their hit cd.
