:.: [1] opening thoughts :.:

Wow.  It's been almost a month since I wrote an issue of this thing. 
Kinda weird and scary.. I guess I've been kind of busy with returning
to skool and working and just life in general, and +evo+ just kind of
slipped my mind.  

Anyway, on the update front:

    + The anonymous ftp directory has changed. A subtle change, but a
      change nonetheless.  The new directory is /pub/Zines/evolution,
      as opposed to the previous /pub/Zines/Evolution.  The archive
      is still hosted on ftp.etext.org.
    + I've made an +evolution+ web page, which may or may not become
      filled with stuff as time permits.  Right now, it's got all of
      the back issues and a little background information.  Tie your
      web browser to a leash and drag it to
      http://www.gweep.net/~zaphod/evo/ and the world will be a
      happier place for it.
    + Random technical point for anyone who noticed the change, or
      didn't and likes to know this sort of random technical
      knowledge: I've increased the width of the paragraphs from 68
      columns to 70 columns.  Again, subtle change, and you probably
      don't even care, but I thought I'd tell you all anyway because
      I have the power to do so. 

Alsi, I'd like to address yr attention to a new zine that you may
enjoy, called Plastic Nausea.  An odd name, yes, but not without a
great story behind it.  Maybe you'll find out wbout it someday, but
in the mantime, you can just enjoy the zine.  It's similar to
+evolution+, so if you like what I do, you'll probably like PN also.

:.: [2] skool :.:

So, I'm back at skool now, the beautiful paradise of UMass Lowell. 
Maybe I'm being a bit sarcastic, but I feel different this time.  I
almost _want_ to be here.. it's weird.

I think a big part of this new feeling of confidence and the fact
that I no longer view Lowell as a depressing hole is the drastic
academic change I've made, going from Computer Science to English. 
It seemed like an obvious choice; I hate math, which CS is filled
with, and I love writing and reading, which is the emphasis of
English.  

Whatever the explanation, the point is that I almost feel like I
belong here, which hasn't happened before.  Not that I mind..


                      -:+:--------------:+:-


:.: [3] south 23 : chapter one :.:

    . this is the first chapter to a story I started writing back in
    . December while I was at a friend of mine's Youth Symphony
    . concert.  I needed something to keep my mind off of some
    . things, and I just happened to have my notebook, so I wrote
    . this.  there is currenly a second chapter, which could stand on
    . its own, and a partially completed third chapter.  both of
    . these may appear in later issues of +evolution+.  
    . 
    . for now, I have given this story a random title of "South 23".


I talked to Sophocles yesterday.  He told me I was wrong.

"Yeah, I know."  He was startled for a second.  "I've always been
wrong, as far as I know."  Sophocles walked away, down the rainy
street, into the night.

I noticed him about an hour later, standing outside a small coffee
shop.  He held a half-sipped cappuccino in his left hand and had the
right stuck into the pocket of his dark brown corduroy pants.

"You're still wrong," he shouted as I crossed the parking lot. 
Walking nearer, it became obvious that he wasn't exactly sober.  His
eyes wandered, and he never seemed to be looking in the right
direction when he spoke.  Tiny beads of sweat dripped down his
forehead, somewhatof an unusual occurance for a cool autumn evening
on Cape Cod.

"You said that before."

"Yeah, and I meant it too.  You're just wrong.  That's all there is
to it."  His glazed eyes seemed to be staring at the car, a brown
Volvo, behind me.

"I think I've figured that out by now, old man."  As I moved toward
the door of the shop, the man standing next to Sophocles flicked his
cigarette to the ground, gave me a short blank stare, and walked into
the parking lot.

A green convertible drove by the coffee shop.  Led Zeppelin's "Whole
Lotta Love" pounded through the air at an obscene volume as it passed
by.  I had seen that car before.


                      -:+:--------------:+:-


:.: [4] grip over drop :.:

    . I wrote this a while ago, and found it next to the first
    . chapter of "South 23" in my notebook..


over.
it's over.
i can see it in yr eyes
or rather, i can't.
the dreaded silence
grips my young heart and tears
violently trying to rip the arteries
the veins
straight    from    my    chest.
i wrestle
trying to keep my heart inside
but it's futile
a waste of time
because i know it's already gone
i gave up ownership months ago.
i wonder
wonder if it's real
if you're real or just some fabrication 
    of my naive mind
wonder if it's you i love
    or the concept of being in love
of not being alone
wonder why i always do this to myself
build it up in my mind
build these fantasies
that never happen
and then fall
down
drop
drop off
drop feed
drop drop
drop
again and again
i fall
and i hit the ground
and it's over.

:.: [5] interview with a legend :.:

    . this was originally done for a zine a friend of mine and I were
    . planning to start last summer, but it never happened.  the idea
    . was that we, as a part of this zine, were going to interview
    . various legends of the local scene.  I was the first. :)
    . maybe I'll incorporate this into +evolution+ at some point.
    . the interview was conducted by lizrdking.

<duct-tape> ***** INTERVIEW MODE ON *****
> hehheheheheh
> tell me about greenday :)
* duct-tape giggles.
<duct-tape> Well, I like them, in general...
<duct-tape> I prefer the old stuff, of course.
<duct-tape> Slappy, 1000 hours, kerplunk, etc.
<duct-tape> Dookie has its brief moments..
<duct-tape> I haven't heard the whole of their new album. 
> what about greenday "selling out"
<duct-tape> Well, i mean, I think they did sell out to an extent,
<duct-tape> though there's still some remnants of the way they were..
<duct-tape> like that song "Walking Contradiction" on the new album..
<duct-tape> that song is very old-skool green day
<duct-tape> but otherwise, I feel that they're just pop musicians
    with a lot of distortion who act like punx.
> ok..
> now what about punk rock in general
> and its ride to the mainstream
<duct-tape> Well..
<duct-tape> I feel that punk has taken a turn for the worse, becoming
    mainstream and all...
<duct-tape> That the old punk values have kind of been lost.
<duct-tape> Which isn't the fault of punx themselves,
<duct-tape> but of mainstream culture...
<duct-tape> I mean, since bands such as Nirvana popularized a more
    punk sound,
<duct-tape> even cock-rock morons have jumped on the punk bandwagon.
<duct-tape> And that's just not cool.
> now completely off track...
<duct-tape> fine with me.
> whats the best movie youve seen lately.. (doesnt have to be a new release)
<duct-tape> Braveheart.
> really?
> braveheart?
<duct-tape> Oh yes.
<duct-tape> That movie is amazing.
> why?
> a bunch of guys running aorund in skirts?
> :)
<duct-tape> haha.
<duct-tape> Really, the story, the acting, it's all amazing.
<duct-tape> it made me cry.
> ok, on that line...
> is it alright for men to cry?
> and if so/if not....
> when and why not/ why...
<duct-tape> Damn straight.
<duct-tape> I mean, that idea that men aren't supposed to crybecause
    they're supposed to be "strong", that's complete bullshit...
<duct-tape> If I need to cry, I'm going to do it.
> why is it bullshit?
<duct-tape> It's a stereotype of males...
> is it alright for men to cry around women?
> and especially a significant other?
<duct-tape> of course!
<duct-tape> I encourage it.
<duct-tape> I mean, if you're feeling weak, don't pretend to be
    strong, no matter who the person is, because it will just build up
    inside and end up hurting a lot.
> what do you think of rap?
<duct-tape> I love rap.
<duct-tape> rap is some phat shit.
> what about gangsta rap?
<duct-tape> Well, some of the beatz can be cool, but the lyrics and the
    message, not cool at all.
> do you think musik really has an influence on young people?
<duct-tape> Oh yeah...
<duct-tape> I mean, I walk around Orleans, and I see all kinds of
    different musical infulences...
<duct-tape> music influences the way people dress and talk and think.
> is that good or bad?
<duct-tape> I think it's bad, because if you listen to rap, you're
    stereotyped as a "homie" by the way you dress and act...
<duct-tape> which may be completely uncharacteristic of the person you are.
<duct-tape> you know?
> <nod>
> ok...
> what do you think is the biggest problem that faces todayz youf?
<duct-tape> Wow..
<duct-tape> Hmm.
<duct-tape> I think apathy is a big problem...I mean, a lot of kids
    these days just don't care.
<duct-tape> Also, the effects of Reagan and Bush will hurt today's
    youth in the future.
> hrm.. thats a good point...
> presedncy:
> dole or clinton?
> or niether?
<duct-tape> Perot.
<duct-tape> I'm voting for Perot.
> ahhh :)
> why?
<duct-tape> Because I liked his ideals back in 1992, and I think that
    his views remain relevant now.
> most importatnt election issue to you is......
<duct-tape> Uhhhh...
<duct-tape> freedom of speech.
<duct-tape> I mean, the CDA is still being reviewed and stuff, so
    that's important.
> where do you stand on it?
<duct-tape> Here's how I stand.
<duct-tape> Go up to the president, and say "Fuck you", becuase you can.
<duct-tape> you have protection under the first amendment, so do it.
<duct-tape> Free speech shouldn't be infringed upon in any way whatsoever.
> another random question.....
<duct-tape> shoot.
> if you coudl do one thing before you die, it would be.. _______....
<duct-tape> Play a concert with Sonic Youth, R.E.M., G.Love and
    Special Sauce, Fugazi, Rush, and Dweezil Zappa.
<duct-tape> oh..
<duct-tape> and cheesewheel :)
> :)
> yr single greatest fear is ......
<duct-tape> Right now, :.:[name edited out for privacy purposes]:.:
<duct-tape> aside from that, being alone.
<duct-tape> Being alone is bad.
> why?
<duct-tape> Alone?
<duct-tape> Because being alone, with no one to turn to, is the worst
    feeling in the world.
<duct-tape> You feel so weak...
<duct-tape> You just want to die.
> jumping aboard now.....
> best and worst things about the web/internet/iRC...
<duct-tape> Whoa boy...
<duct-tape> hehe.
<duct-tape> The single worst thing about the internet is spam.
<duct-tape> NO question.
<duct-tape> The best thing...
<duct-tape> You can make some really good friends over the Net.
<duct-tape> Plus, there's so much information out there...
<duct-tape> It's like going to the library, but way bigger.
> iRC = ______
<duct-tape> The worst drug on the planet.
<duct-tape> ehehe.
<duct-tape> Seriously, though, it's a lot of fun.
<duct-tape> talking to people hundereds, even thousands of miles
    away, it's great.
<duct-tape> And it's free!
<duct-tape> Free stuff rocks.
> whats yr favorite pasttime?
<duct-tape> Right now, IRCing.
<duct-tape> hehe.
> hhehehe
> what do you spend the most time doing?
<duct-tape> But music is my favorite thing on the planet.
> what do you do musikally?
<duct-tape> I play the guitar, percussion, sing, bass, and a little
    keybaords, in that order.
<duct-tape> And I write songs.
> upcoming projekts?
<duct-tape> Well..
<duct-tape> I was working on a new release, but financial problems
    prevent me from continuing for the time being.
> thats no good!
<duct-tape> Yeah, it sucks rocks through a tiny straw.
> bwhahhwahwawh
> anything else you wanna say before i cut you off?
<duct-tape> I'll just leave you with one of my favorite quotes...
<duct-tape> It's from Michael Stipe, at an R.E.M. concert back in 1986.
<duct-tape> "I pledge allegiance to no flag.  If I pledge allegiance,
    and I do, it's to a flag that I made, out of cloth, that I like.  I
    pledge allegiance to the ground I stand on."
<duct-tape> That's it.
