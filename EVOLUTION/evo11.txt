+evolution+ returns.  I make no excuses.  I forgot about it, didn't
feel inspired; there's a lot of reasons I haven't written an issue
since the first day of may.

news:  the gweepnet web site went away (well, www.gweep.net is still
there, but my web stuff isn't).  I'm making a new web page.  when
it's done, the URL will be http://www.underworld.net/~dtb/evolution.
back issues will be made available there, and they're still available
from ftp.etext.org in the directory /pub/Zines/ASCII/evolution.

my email address has also changed.  you can still send mail to
zaphod@sidehack.gweep.net and I'll still get it, but I technically
don't exist there anymore.  send all future correspondence to
dtb@underworld.net to ensure the most prompt response possible.

hidden signals
somehow hears the hidden signals
feels them reverberate
through shaking skull
down aching spine
to slowly beating heart

heart processes signals
takes raw data
filters it
creates an interpretation
based on facts and hypotheses
passes it on
back to the brain

brain sees what heart sees
filters processed data out of blood
decides on proper course of action
sends message to right hand
right hand picks up gun
pulls trigger
shoots brain
brain dies
hand dies

yeah,
I'm sad.
who wouldn't be?
I think I have a right to be.
the realization
that something very dear
and sacred
to you
is no longer there
is a painful one.
I feel a sort of emptiness.
my heart
seems void now.
somehow,
it's ok.

                                                          :(manifest):

zines are a strange species.  nearly all of them are some sort of
counter-culture or anti-culture outlet for what really amounts to the
degenerate freaks of society that no one else will listen to.  I
guess I fall into this category somehow.  I guess this zine does too.

I've been thinking lately about this zine, and what it means to me,
and what purpose it serves in my life.  when I started it almost a
year ago, +evolution+ was an outlet for my depression, a way to try
to understand myself and the environment around me.  now, I don't
really know.. probably explains why I haven't written an issue in
over 6 months.  this issue is a strange one..  it's taken me forever
to write, even though there isn't that much content in it so far.

another reason I didn't write for 6 months is that I wasn't
depressed.  shortly after issue ten got released, I entered the most
amazing and important relationship of my life.  it was amazing, and I
felt above everything that had tormented me in the past, above the
depression and angst.  up until about a month ago, I thought it would
last forever..

the future of this is uncertain.  technically, it's over; we called
it off and resigned to our friendship, the strongest friendship I've
ever expierienced.  one part of me accepts this.. the other doesn't.
I still feel as in love as I did two months ago, three months ago,
six months ago.  this part of me still believes that this
relationship is *the* relationship, that nothing could ever come that
could surpass it.  so, I think, and wonder, and attempt to come to
some sort of understanding of myself and the two emotions fighting
their battle over my heart and mind.

so, after the long haitus, +evolution+ is back. as always, the
writing schedule follows no calendar whatsoever, so the next issue
could be out in 3 hours or 3 years.  don't yell at me about it, it's
the way this thing goes..

at this point, issue eleven has reached its terminus.  there are no
connecting flights.  for passengers continuing on to other
destinations, gate assignments are available at the ticket desk. 
thank you for flying +evolution+.
