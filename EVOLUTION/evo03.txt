    she was 15 years old
    and never seen the ocean
    she climbed into a van
    with a vagabond
    and the last thing she said
    was "I love you mom"
    and a little rain
    never hurt no one

    Hey hey out there.  I'd just like to inform you of a
semi-official +evolution+ web site.  It's at
http://outside.wserv.com/toast/evolution/.  Thanks to the Outside
Broadcast Network and Toast for hosting it.  Saves me the trouble
of making a page for it. :)

    Just as a warning, this issue is going to be really short.

Over.

It's over, isn't it?

Why don't you just say so?

Why do you have to avoid me, ignore me, treat me as if you don't 
even know me?

Do you think it makes me feel any better?

It doesn't.  It makes me feel like shit.  It makes me want to DIE.
I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but wanting to be dead
isn't a pleasant feeling.

I understand that maybe this isn't as important to you as it is to
me, but that still doesn't change the fact that what happened
Friday night was complete hell for me, being almost completely
ignored by the one person who I've ever truly loved in my entire
life.  

I thought you cared.  I thought you loved me.  I really did.

Maybe I was wrong.
