so, kayem's a sped and can't put together one issue a month and ten
days, thusly, I'm taking over again.  sorry for the delay (like the
saying goes, if you want something done right...)

in other news, there is no other news - at least as far as
+evolution+ politics and technical noise goes.  well, maybe the new
style format, but I change that all the time anyway, so that should
be no big surprise.  the web page is still up at
http://www.gweep.net/~zaphod/evo/ if you feel like checking that out,
want back issues, or whatever.  write me mail and I might put it up
on the mail page for all to see.

and once again, tell yr friends about +evolution+, since the world of
zines (paper or electron-based) thrives on word of mouth.  print
copies for yr technologically inferior friends, and tell them to
write me (zaphod@sidehack.gweep.net) if they want an email
subscription.

i wish i was strong enough
wasn't so immersed in this
that i cared more about me than i do about you
or about anyone

i want to overcome this
i'm strong enough to conquer other things
the strength _is_ there
why can't i use it?
why can't i just stand up
right now
and talk to you?

now you're doing it again
curled up into a little ball
beautiful as the first time
yr strength
my weakness

i know it can't happen
at least
not like i want it to
but it's stupid that i can't even confront
you
or is it me i'm trying to confront?
my own inner self
the demons in my chest
pounding at me
taunting me
it hurts
fucking christ, it hurts
so much
i want it to stop
but
i
can't
fucking
do
it

i'm weak
i wish someone would
help me be strong.

i think that i will close up shop
i think i'll take the final drop
really learn to use these hands
to help reach out, let it go

they reached out every day
but i always got in the way
see, i've got to fuck it up
just to make sure they don't stay

mother, call me up and tell me eveything will flow
and make me feel like i will know
but all the patterns will unravel
while on the softer stair i travel

let me go

                  :(indri's box and assorted chartreuse abstractions):

I was reading issue #12 of Looks Yellow, Tastes Red today cuz Colette
sent me a copy along with a very nice letter, and she had a little
article/musing about love and certain things that go along with it,
particularly physical sensations. "I have this terrible pain inside
that I indentify directly with being in love.  I am still in love
with this boy but still, of course, it's not like it was those first
few months - when there was all the fear of falling and being hurt
and the mystery of it all." As I read this, a lot of emotions came
back to me concerning my first and so far only foray into the world
of romantic engagements - the joy of knowing I was in love, the
elation when I would see her after the common prolonged absences that
went along with our distance, the fear of falling and it not working
because we were so far away, and the fear of parental rejection
(rejection that eventually led to the demise of our relationship) -
and also memories - standing on a green line subway car with Bryan
and Aidan when they told me, the long train rides home after Saturday
visits, the warmth and innocence as I comforted her in her sickness,
how she felt in my arms that final night before it all fell apart.  I
remember this time, a time of confusion and bliss, simultaneous
confidence and total fear, and I realized how special this is.  Aidan
and I discussed this one day - it's sort of like pandora's box,
except reversed, so that the box holds all sorts of good things and
one bad thing (that being fear), and when indri's box (as it was
called) was opened, you could never get those good emotions it
released back, you could never again experience that first feeling of
love and total elation.

this was all several months ago, of course, and I feel much
differently about her and myself.  I still care deeply for her, but
it doesn't seem that she quite understands that, which often results
in us getting angry at each other over revoltingly stupid matters,
most commonly that we're both quite shy and find it difficult to talk
to each other, so it seems like we're avoiding or ignoring each
other.  I don't want this to continue, and I have tried to remedy the
situation as best as my naive mind knows how.  I only hope that one
day we can talk to each other as equals and put aside all the
bullshit that's happened between us since december.

at this time, I would like to encourage some reader participation in
shaping some of the final product that is +evolution+.  I want to
write some teen-magazine-like quizzes, so if anyone has a good idea
for a topic for such a quiz, drop me a line.

also, I'm thinking a silly advice section could bring excitement and
fun to +evolution+, however cheesy it is, so if you mail me with yr
problems, no matter how bizarre, I'll pretend I have the slightest
clue about how to wash away yr problems and include it in the next
issue.

none of this can work without yr help, so send in your quiz ideas and
advice today!

finally, as always, submissions of poetry, prose, and general
nonsense are fully encouraged.  not only do they broaden the scope of
+evolution+, they take the burden off of me to write 10K of
ramblings about my own stupid life. :)

oh, and if any NRHS people want to write up a little review of the
honky/freak showdown, I'll include that too.

and with that, I'm out5k.. catch you later.
