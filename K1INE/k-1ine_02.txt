Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Ahoy! K-1ine issue number two is finally completed! *gasp*

Why hello boy5 and girl5, it is I The Clone bringing you k-koolness
all the way from NPA 780! This infact is the second issue of K-1ine,
and I'm infact very pleased with the responses I've gotten from
the first issue¹. Since this is the summer of 1999, and since this is
the last summer of the Millenium, I wanted to release a special zine
just for the occasion! 

But first off I want to do some shoutouts to my local crew out in
NPA 780/403
 
In non-alphabetical order (cuz I don't know my ABC's)
here they are:

^/HACKCANADA/^
` [Wizbone (780), Cyb0rg/asm (780), The Question (780), Hex_Edit (780)] '
Wildman (780), Renderman (780) 
#;				
Lord Narayana (403), WZ (780), Phil (780), Mark (403), Jester (780)   			


As I type this, I am listening to the soothing insturmentals 
of Richard James' (aka Aphex Twin) 'Boy/Girl'. Beautiful, beautiful song.

Annnnyways, I should talk about my zine some more so I can impress you
uber-elite type judgemental fuckers. What the fuck do you want me to say?
It's all here for you in plain text. If you can't comprehend my digital 
doo-doo, then by all means hit the back botton (left arrow for Lynx folks).

Drop your 'cid, eat your shrooms, smoke your weed, sniff your coke,
shoot your smack, but please don't get any on the fur coat and read 
my compilation of oblivious ramblings.

		        Bridge Skanning
		-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
	
				

Telus Advanced Communications (TACS) offers a service called 
'Corner Advantage Teleconferencing'.  

A service which allows its customers to connect to a multiple-user-bridge
to:
     * keep field offices informed about new policies and programs;
     * announce new products to branch offices;
     * hold regular status update meetings;
     * resolve emergencies;
     * review product development;
     * reach several reporters simultaneously for a news announcement;
     * brainstorm and plan marketing and sales strategies;
     * resolve labour relations issues; and
     * interview job applicants.
     * etc.

Some of the features with this service include:

     * highest quality sound with minimum background noise;
     * security passwords;
     * mute feature so specific lines can listen only;
     * taping your conference onto cassettes;
     * polling to record votes from opinion polls and focus groups; 

How to set up a bridge conf:

     * Dial 1-800-900-MEET (6338)
     * Follow the voice prompts and select Teleconferencing
     * Reserve the date, start time and duration of your meeting and the
       number of ports required.
 

Now that I've outlined the basic features of 
Corner Advantage Teleconferencing, I'd like to share with you an
idea that came into my mind; Bridge Skanning. 


How do I find a bridge?
-----------------------

Most phreakers who do find bridges do out of dumb luck.
They are usually skanning a prefix looking for VMB's, PBX's, ANI's,
and modem carriers.

What I did was I called up 1-800-900-MEET, and said:

"Hi there. I was wondering out of curiousity, what prefix or prefixes
 do the Edmonton bridges use?"

Being gullible and unware of my intentions, the perky Telus operator
gladly gave me the prefix. A few hour later I called back and asked if there
were any other cities that had CAT (Corner Advantage Teleconferencing). 
Calgary apparently is the only other city that does.

Using the same "social engineering" technique, I snagged the other prefix
and glady grinned because now I had completed the first step in finding
a bridge.

Seeing on how I like to help out fellow local (780/403) phreaks, 
I'm going to post the prefixes.


City     NPA:  Pfx
----     ---   --- 
Calgary  403   216   
Edmonton 780   460      

!Yipee! ;)

Now go ahead! Skan out these prefixes and you'll surely find yourself
on a bridge conf. 

From what I've heard, if you do happen to connect to a bridge you'll 
obviously hear many parties talking. 

What my suggestions
to you are:

* Keep quiet
* Listen to what is being said and write down potentially "important" info. 
  Because remember, most bridges that are up are corporations.
  And we know the conspiracies bureaucrats create.
* If possible, record the conversation using a ear piece-like device  
  you can pick up at your local Radio Shack for about $10.00/CDN each.

--

I hope I've helped fellow telco enthusiasts, 
pissed off some Telus employees, and made phun for all!
Happy CAT-skanning!

	'PROPER E-58 MIXING INSRUCTIONS'
		
________
[compiled]
[by: The Clone]
[June 17, 1999]



		ATTENTION!!

Tongue depressors are now being shipped with E-58 Resilient Kits.
The tongue depressor is to be used for mixing the Catalyst Part 2
(small can) prior to combinging with the Part 1 (large can).

Proper E-58 mixing instructions are as follows:


1. Carefully open Part 2 (small can).

2. Insert a tongue depressor into the small can and thoroughly mix
   contents making sure to scrape the bottom of the can during mixing.
   All material settled to the bottom must be blended into the liquid! 
   Tongue depressor is for "one time use only". Discard after each use.

3. After mixing pour the contents of Part 2 (small can) into Part 1 
   (large can). Visually check that all material from the small can has been 
   added to the large can. All material must be added to the large can.

4. Blend the mixture of the Parts 1&2 (large and small can) using a 
   mechanical mixer such as a Jiffy mixer (Part # E-60) and drill until a
   consistent gray color is present. Complete mixing should take about 2-4
   minutes.

5. Apply mixture to metal and ABS liner in a consistent coating using a 
   short nap roller (1/4" or 3/8" nap).

6. Concrete should be cast within 1 hour of applying the E-58 to the liner
   set.


 Any problems or technical questions should be addressed to Wilbert, Inc.
 Technical Services.

----------------------------=( HiR Issue #9 )=----------------------------
-----------------------=( Creation of the Coupler )=----------------------
------------------------------=( By: Axon )=------------------------------
------------------=( Digital Pictures on the HiR site )=------------------

Creating a coupler, eh?  Well, this is the mammoth that I've been wanting
for the longest time... An article, with instructions, on how to make the
acoustic coupler.  Granted, I did not "create" the acoustic coupler...
But indeed I did come up with a way to make one out of some cheap stuff
that can be found at any wal-mart and radio shack store... The best part
is that I spent less than $20 making this beast.  It's not at all
professional looking, and it's not as "heavy-duty" and rugged looking as
some of the expensive couplers on today's market, but it makes a decent 
connection, and that's all ya need.  It's not as compact as the
production couplers, either; BUT IT'S A COUPLER!  Wow your friends and
amaze them, cuz you can tell 'em you wired this one up yourself (but 
tell 'em Axon told you how to do it!) 

This Coupler can only handle about 2400 bps on a good phone.  This is
plenty for checking e-mail, telnetting to a unix box, or getting on 
the local Bulletin Boards.  It's sufficient for getting online from a
payphone.  The reason the connection is slower than a store-bought
coupler is because the more expensive ones have a lot of fancy stuff,
anti-echoing filters and the like.  I don't have the expertise to build
this type of circuit, but this coupler DOES work.  I HAVE tested this on a
lot of payphones already, and it seems to work great at 1200 bps (which is
what I usually use on payphones with my high-end coupler, too).  So far,
I've put about 10 hours on the coupler, and I haven't had to change the
battery in it yet.  Actual battery runtime might differ according to your
modem.  ALSO: As with my coupler, there are probably some PCMCIA (laptop)
modems that this doesn't work with...  It should work with almost any
external modem.  Test it with an external modem if you have any problems.

------------------------=( Some Background Info! )=-----------------------

The theory behind the coupler is simple: It takes modem sounds from a
modular jack, and converts them to audio sounds, and forces them into the
microphone of a telephone handset.  At the same time, it's also listening
to the handset's speaker, and converting that back to electrical signals,
and forcing them back into the modem, through the modular jack.  This
allows one to connect via modem in areas where you can't find a safe 
modular phone jack to plug into.  This is great for hotels and offices
with digital phones, at pay phones in the airport, or anywhere.  You just
strap the coupler to the phone handset, and use the modem normally (after
inserting change in pay phones, if needed)

I have a store-bought high-end VERY nice acoustic coupler, but the more
and more I thought about it, the more and more I saw that my coupler is
just an inside-out telephone... Obviousely, hooking 2 telephones together
with a phone cord won't allow the 2 phones to talk to each other, there
has to be a voltage source or something, so I took a chance by slicing one
of the wires (the green one in this case), and placing a 9-volt battery
across it, in series.  The 2 phones that were on either end of the cord
would actually hear the other end.  The 2 phones acted like normal.  
(NOTE: Hooking 2 modems together with a phone cord that has a 9v battery
wired in series will allow the 2 modems to communicate without using any
telco phone lines!)

I plugged one end of the cord into my laptop modem, and held the phone on
the other end close to our office phone, so the Mics and speakers were
facing the opposite way (end to end, speaker to microphone), and made a
real-life 300 BPS internet connection.  This is where it all began for
me.  I quickly drew up a sketch of what I would have to do to make a
normal phone into a coupler.  I then went and bought the parts and made my
first coupler at home in a matter of hours.  When it was done, it worked
great, just like my store-bought one, but a lot uglier.  For 20 bucks
worth of parts, I am pleased!

-----------------------=( Some Assembly Required. )=----------------------

This is going to be the official hands-on article for HiR 9.  For those of
you who still like soldering, and cutting wires, and opening stuff up,
this is for you.  For you software-only guys: this is NOT an easy project
to undertake, but feel free to try.  Worst case: you're out about 20 bucks
of parts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parts List:

>From Wal-Mart:

$7.97	I bought a cheap Unisonic "Slim Line" (model #6420 FG) from
	Wal-Mart.
	But any single-piece phone (doesn't have a cord from the base
	unit to the handset) will work fine, I'd guess.

$0.96	A 3-pack of medium suction cups (1.5 inches diameter, but we only 
	need 2 suction cups.  I tried large ones, WAY too big).  These
	will become cut up and no-longer good for suction cups.  We're
	using them to keep noise isolated away from the speaker and
	microphone.

$2.44	30-inch velcro straps.  These are going to hold the phone handset
	down to the coupler, to maintain as much isolated noise as
	possible.  If loud noises get picked up by the coupler, it could
	be mistaken for data, and may even cause you to disconnect.  Most
	of the modern modem protocols can handle this type of noise
	without actual data errors, but play it safe.


>From Radio Shack:

$1.89	Set of five 9-Volt battery terminals.  We just need one, though.
	This will connect the 9-volt battery to the coupler's phone line.

Opt.	You may want to get a small project case or a battery holder.
	Determine this after you open your phone up.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Open the phone up. Remove screws, snap the case open, whatever.  Try
	not to damage the phone's outer plastic too much, because if there
	is enough room for a 9-volt inside there, it saves you from using
	a project case.  Be CAREFUL with the wires to the Mic and Speaker.

2.  Try to get the guts out of the phone case.  Loosen up the speaker,
	mic, ringer buzzer, and the circuit boards.  You should be able to
	get all the stuff out, leaving an (almost) empty shell of the
	phone.  Try to get just the circuit boards in there, as the
	speaker and mic will be on the outise of the case at the end of
	this project.  If there is enough room for a 9-Volt battery to
	fit inside and close the case, then you should probably stick with
	this phone shell as the case for the coupler.

3.  Cut the centers out of the suction cups so that they fit the mic and
	speaker nicely.  They should be fit so that hot-melt-glue can be
	used to hold them in place.  They should look like this (but DO
	NOT glue them on yet!):

		speaker			   Microphone

  Suction cup-->\_____/      __________       \__/ <---Suction cup    
		 |   |      / Circuit /       |__|   
                 \___======/ Board   /        //
                           |________/==========     _
                             \\                    [ |
                              =====================[_| <-- RJ11 Jack.


4.  This is where you may need some soldering skills.  The Speaker wires
	will probably be really short.  You will probably want to  
	lengthen them up by adding more wire, like 4 or 5 inches.  Just
	lengthen it up a bit so that it can be positioned to reach the
	microphone of almost any handset.

5.  Now, to add the battery.  You need to cut the green wire coming from
	the RJ-11 Jack on the phone.  Wire the 9-volt battery terminal in
	series with the green wire... This should be done inside the case
	or inside the phone if you verified there was enough room for it. 
	It should look like this:

     _|_               to circuit board... -->
	|-------------------------------------------------- < Red Wire
  RJ-11 |
     ___|--------------_      _---------------------------- < Green Wire
      |	                \    /
      \  Inside Phone   _\__/_
       \                 o__O
        \_              |    |
                        | 9v |
                        |____|
		


6.  I mounted the microphone on the top of the phone case, and placed a
	Velcro strap by the microphone.  I kept the speaker loose so it
	could strap onto almost any phone, and I put velcro on it as well.

-----------------------=( Using your new coupler )=----------------------


I basically strap the speaker of the phone handset to the microphone, and
strap the coupler's speaker to the handset's microphone, hook it up and
modemize.  Also, there's no need for an on-off switch for this coupler.
It only connects the battery when the modem goes off-hook to dial, and
while connected.  When you disconnect, the battery's not in use anymore.

There was an article earlier, in HiR 1 called "List of hacking
necessities", and I cover some general useage of the Acoustic coupler in
there.  I did find some more info on changing what Baud rate your modem is
using.  You probably have to set your modem for 1200 to 2400 bps for the
coupler to work.

Table of AT commands to set baud rate limiters.  I've run across 2 sets of
AT commands.  All of my modems work with one of these or the other, but I
can't guarantee that either one of these sets will work for your modem.
I won't go all the way up to 57,600 bps... if you need to limit your
speed, you'll have to limit it to 9600 or lower (on a commercial coupler).
Like I said, 2400 is about the best that this home-brew coupler will pull.

	Baud Rate (bps)		AT Command	Alternate AT Command
	--------------		----------	--------------------
	300			???		AT&N1
	1200			ATF4		AT&N2
	2400			ATF5		AT&N3
	4800			ATF6		AT&N4
	7200			ATF7		AT&N5
	9600			ATF8		AT&N6
	--------------		----------	--------------------


Happy hackin', and the digital photos are going to be linked from the 
HiR 9 page as soon as I have them sucked off the digi-cam, to show you
what my coupler really looks like... If you want to download them, They'll
be downloadable as hir9pics.zip and hir9pics.tar.gz from the HiR 9 page,
and in the HiR_Archive section of the ftp site...

		'Anti-Suicide'
		

by: Athrow


To the man who posts suicide messages on websites...

His children will commit suicide out of shame for having this moron as a
parental figure.  They'll post their message on a site just like his and he'll
have to live with the guilt of being a sub-human and the lowest filth
imaginable.  You know that feeling you get when you've been betrayed?  that's
the same feeling that's going to burn up inside of him... on the brightest day
in the greenest park that feeling will pop up causing him to burst into tears.
His veins will fill with anger and pain, he'll be haunted day and night.  And
there will be no escape, because even after death his energy will continue
knowing that he failed in this life... that he committed the ultimate sin...
mockery of another's soul.  People will spit on his nameless grave, and just
before he dies when it comes time for him -as it does for all- to look back upon
his life in the great mirror of truth he'll break down and cry, his last seconds

of life will be filled with shame and guilt knowing that what he did was wrong,
knowing that in his life he fought for nothing and truly did nothing.  knowing
that one way or another nobody really gives a damn about whether he lives or
dies.

Maybe he can learn, forgiveness can be achieved through his learning of what he
is doing is disrespectful to the soul and thus wrong.  only when "he knows" can
he begin to truly make reprimands for what he has done.

Athrow
-cheers. you've spent an eternity to get here, this is your second of life.
don't waste it.

Caladan [6/19/99]
review by pinguino of Penguin Palace

The nation lives for dune; a massive gathering of ravers set deep in
the tranquility of a California desert. With Dune cancelled, the true
raver vibe exploded on the net. Born from the Stormriders and Stargazers
mailing list was Caladan. Prep time: 3 days.

Caladan was an event in the spirit of yesteryear; raves the way they were
meant to be: spontaneous dyi renegade gatherings. No corporate sponsors, no
city involvement, and exclusive word of mouth invites coupled with
complicated and confusing mappoint directions. Caladan was up past Magic
Mountain, 30 mi up the winding dirt roads in the scrub covered mountains.
The dancefloor was cliffside clearing with a majestic view of the populated
valley below. A pure night sky with the Milky Way streaked across the
center, littered with millions of tiny solar systems, inducing a mindtrance
greater than the best lightshow Dune could offer. Planes flying overhead saw
only the glowsticks, buzzing around like a hive of  drunken fireflies.

The Stargazers had a tent with a computer set up in it, and had their
visuals and lighting inside the tent. In my opinion, that's even better than
setting the stuff out on the dance floor (for an outdoors party), because
the lights would detract from the enjoyment of seeing the natural night sky.
Good call, Stargazers.

The highlight of the evening was Sumbry's set, which brought the crowd
together like a seascape teeming with life. A central figure in the planning
of Caladan, Sumbry is also an extremely talented up-and-coming Los
Angeles DJ. Prior to his set, a cake was brought out by fellow Stormriders
to celebrate Sumbry's birthday.

Another notable mention was Galactic's set, which blew flame to the spark
set off by Sumbry's set. During this set, Draco and I took our high-school
years of karate sparring to the extreme and created a touch-tap sparring
match based around glowsticks.

The sun came up around 6am, bringing an aura of tranquility to the ravers.
Deep conversations and clusters seemed to ensue around that point. A few
hours later, Cloud and I brought out suprise #1.. a  dinosaur-dragon-godzilla
pinata fondly named Gecko. Filled to the brim with assorted Jolly Ranchers,
foiled confetti, Black Cherry Blow Pops, and Cherry Blow Pops, Gecko was
strung up to a tree by three bungee cords. "He's too cute to beat" was the
concensus of the group that formed to play the game. Two strikes were
allowed per turn, and each raver that went up chose the next person. Thirty
or so minutes later, Gecko was gutted and decapitated and spewn across the
forrest floor. The head was awarded to Chipmunk.

Suprise #2 was next.. coolers filled with grapes and lush strawberries were
passed around to everyone. Screw those people who put "fruit" on their
flyers and only bring enough for like 20 people. Caladan had so much fruit
that by the time everyone left there was still a box of strawberries, a
package of grapes, a melting cake, and a bigass watermelon.

Overall, Caladan was seriously a trek back in time, to a world when
commercial raves only happened once in a blue, non-drug-enhanced moon. I
hope to see more raves similar to Caladan this summer; it is the key to
bringing a true sence of PLUR back to the rave community.

	NIS Codes
-
by: The Clone

--
Not-In-Service messages are quite annoying aren't they? When you think
you're going to find a cool kode, you run into them. 
You just pull your hair out listening to them. If there was anything
you could wish for, it would be no NIS codes, right? I'm sure you don't feel
that negatively about them. So I decided to compile a list of weird
Not-In-Service codes I ran into over the last few months.

Common:

- 2-E-K
- 14-D
- 1-4
- 711
- 111

Uncommon:

- GTU-39: 1-800-909-5324
- 003-03: 1-800-909-5339
- '3D': 1-800-909-5545

	TELUS Mobility; Panasonic EN-POWR numeric pager exploit
        __                                                   __


    Telus Mobility offers to its customers, 
few types of paging services. One type is called 'EN-POWR numeric pager'. 
With the EN-POWR numeric pager, you get total FLEX coverage. 
In other words, you get coverage all across Alberta.

The Panasonic EN-POWR pre-paid numeric pager is only $99.95, and it comes
with 6 months of enhanced service with a limited but nifty selection
of assorted colors to choose from. 

"But Clone, I have three kids to feed. 
I can't afford this type of service!"

It's completely understandable. That is why I wrote this file.
To show you how to get service that *should* be dirt cheap for 
absolutely free. 

Lets say that one day you were walking down the street minding your
own business, picking flowers, waving to Telus employees as they drive
past in their goodie-vans, when you trip over a pager that has the
word 'Panasonic' labelled on the top. 

This semi-transparent device, with its groovy design is the only thing 
stopping you from suing Telus for leaving its property laying around. 
Then you remember that it's an EN-POWR pre-pad numeric pager and it
has to be property of someone. 

"Hmm..." you think. At this point you can do one of two things;
you can call Telus reporting a missing pager, or you can try to
use your wits to find a way to exploit this.

First lets take a look at the pager features:

Pager features
--------------
· saves 23 messages
· message time stamp
· built in alarm clock
· silent vibration or audible alert
· low battery alert
· shows date and time of day
· selective erase/erase all
· locks important messages
· uses only one AAA battery
· FLEX technology gives you up to 
  four months battery life
· duplicate message indicator
· reminder alert
· backlit display
· automatic on/off


'Saves 23 messages', thought of anything yet? ;)
Sure you have my analytical friend. Along with numeric paging option, 
you also get a voice-mail paging option which requires you to dial the
number the pager is subscribed to.

So you think "How am I going to get this pager number?"
             ------------------------------------------
One easy way is to wait for someone to page you.

Usually friends of the pager customer, don't know the pager is in the
wrong hands so they unknowingly send them a voice-message. Bad idea.
The minute they send that message, the data is sent to the Telus Mobility
switch, and straight to the pager itself. What is displayed?
The pager number, silly!  

(note: if a numeric page is sent, the numbers
displayed on the screen are whatever the person who sent it typed.)

The next step is easy, you call the number. The next thing you'll hear
is one of two things; 1. the customers message, 2. Telus' default message.

By simply pressing '0' on the keypad, you'll next be prompted by an
automated voice saying: "Please enter your access code". 


"How do I acquire the access code?" 
--------------------------------

If the customer was stupid enough to set the default access code, 
all you do is look on the back of the EN-POWR numeric pager, 
and search for the "capcode".

The capcode is the series of numbers at the bottom of the label, 
below the Model, Serial Number, Country Code, and ISC code.
It's easily distinguishable by the letter E and a 7 digit code
after it. An example of a capcode is 'E1230948'. 

The default access code is the last 4 digits of the capcode.
0948 would be the access code for this pager. Now enter 0948. 
If you're lucky you'll get the main menu. My suggestion to you
is to change the access code as soon as possible.

If you're not so lucky, try guessing defaults. 1234, 1111, 1999, 2000, etc.
Until you come across the correct access code. If you're still having
trouble, try selling the pager to some moronic 14 year old who just wants
to look cool in front of his sleezy 14 year old girlfriends'.


Final words
-----------
Now that I've given you step by step instructions on how to
exploit the EN-POWR pre-paid pager, I hope that you've
learned a little bit about how it works.

In the next few months I can see the news talking about 
hundreds/thousands of Telus pagers going missing and then used for
the thieves' evil purposes. I'll sleep well at night knowing I was
the one responsible.

TELUS; 811 Self-Serve stratagem
;^.**;^.**;^.**;^.**;^.**;^.**$

Note;

This file was created mainly for revenge purposes.
I imagine someone with a bit of creativity could
think of numerous ideas. 

TELUS; 811 Self-Serve stratagem contains step by step
instructions, suggestions, etc. on how to fuck with
people's phonebills.
--
  	
Telus believes that *most* of its customers are able to manage
their phone bills by themselves with the help of a friendly
easy-to-use automated self-serve system. So a couple of years ago they
implemented this. When news comes that my phone company is creating 
"newer and better things", I feel it's my job to exploit them.

By calling 811 in the 780 area code, you will be connected to
Telus' automated system. The voice prompt answers by saying:
"Welcome to Telus communications. If you are calling for services 
within Edmonton city, please press one." 

Immediately after hearing this, go ahead and press one. 
The next prompt you hear will be a voice saying: 
"Thank you for calling Telus communications. Please take a moment to listen 
to the following choices before making your selection."

I won't waste your time by typing up every single option available 
because options change and darnit that'd just be plain silly!
Residential self-serve is the option you want to chose. 
Do that by pressing '4'. The next annoying prompt starts off with a 
beep and an automated voice saying: 
"Good morning/afternoon/evening and welcome to Telus communications." 
The first option available is self-serve. Press '1' to access it.

What you'll be prompted for next is your residential telephone number
including your area code. Okay, so we enter '7-8-0 444-4444'.
It takes a moment to process the request, but eventually you get another
prompt. Don't bother even listening to the options. Press '1' immediately.
Run out of patience yet? Good, press '1' again. 

What the voice asks for next is your 'personal identification number'
formerly known as the 'express-line access number'. Telus is stupid.
Your personal identification number is actually a series of numbers.
On your Telus phonebill you have an account number (usually 13 digits long)
at the top of your bill.
Take a look at the last four digits. Those numbers are what makes up
your personal identification number or PIN. 

By entering the PIN number, you now have the options of adding/removing 
calling features as well as disconnecting your telephone service. 
I hope I wasn't too vague with my option descriptions. 
But anyone with half a brain can figure out how to follow 
voice instructions. 

You're probably thinking: 
"Wow Clone, this is great. I just spent five minutes reading 
pointless blabber!"

Don't think too soon! I took it a step further. I thought: 
"Imagine if I could get a hold of an enemy of mine's phonebill. 
What could I do to really piss them off?"

I could easily do the same things previously mentioned; add/remove calling
features, and/or disconnect telephone service. Sound too good to be true?
Of course it doesn't.


Acquiring a phonebill
--

How easy is it? It all depends on where you look of course.
It's my assumption that you probably won't be going over to your
enemies house. Let alone be left unattended with a phonebill laying around
for you to steal. There is one other possibility that comes to mind...
trashing! 

The beautiful art of trashing. As hackers we do it. As phreakers we do it.
But why do we do it? To find neat stuff of course! In this case we're only
looking for phonebill(s).

If your enemy lives in a house, go through his garbage can.
If your enemy is the phone company, go through their trash bins.
Simple as that. Hope you have fun and get arrested.

Alright, here it is folks. My 6000 number hand scan of 800-909-xxxx.
What may not seem like a lot, actually is. You try scanning six thousand
numbers manually and see how far you get. Probably not past 5 numbers no
doubt. Oh not to mention compiling. Anyways, now that I've "expressed"
myself, go ahead and make use of the codes to whatever degree you're
capable of using them to.

- Hmm... what does this look like to you people? Was oml@d2dse.d2d.com.tw
trying to communicate with me? Or was he trying to encode in some strange
language? Spam is my only assumption. 

Look at the e-mail address... '.tw'. Where the hell is this?
I couldn't seem to find out. I viewed the headers and it showed the 
mysterious '.tw'. Odd to say the least.  
If anyone has some idea to where in the world this may have came from, 
please e-mail me at: theclone@code.penguinpowered.com

ÿ°?


	It looks like the end is here once again. Depressing isn't it?
At any rate, I was quite pleased with the positive feedback I received
with K-1ine issue one. I only hope I get the same kind of response with
this issue. 

Wow, It's only the middle of summer and already I've done so much.
One of the major highlights of Summer '99 would have to be going to
DEFCON 7.0 and meeting some really great people. I wish I would have
finished my DEFCON file by now so I could put it in this issue of K-1ine.
Unfortunately due to lack of time that won't be happening. 

By August the Hack Canada crew and I should have our DEFCON files
completed, compiled into one, and posted on the Hack Canada web-site
(www.hackcanada.com).

Now then, what should you look for in the next issue of K-1ine if I ever
get around to it (which may be never if you take a look at my schedual)...


[UPCOMING STUFF]

* More Grande Cache files/skans  - Everyone asks me "Why do you write so
				   much about Grande Cache?" Why not?
				   It's small, it's vulnerable... and
				   dammit I have fun writing crap about it.
				
* Skans - Ahh yes wonderful wonderful skanning. Such a pain in the ass.
	  So fucking boring. What do I get out of it? Sore fingers and
	  a boring life. Besides that I find inspiration from it. 
	  There are systems out there that no one but the people who 
	  maintain it have ever played with or even heard of before.
	  If I can exploit them or even just mess around on them, they
	  make way for excitment and another file to write about.

* ASCII ART - I know I know, you ASCII art people are probably all wondering
	      to yourself "Why oh why is there no art on your zine?"
	      Simple; I just can't seem to find any ASCII ARTISTS.
	      You want to do art for my next zine? You want to help
	      poor 'ol Clonie out? 
 		E-mail me: theclone@code.penguinpowered.com

* MISC - Gosh golly, I do need more misc shit don't I? Hmm... I'll keep
	 that in mind for K-1ine III.


		
		MY FANS MUST BE WONDERING TO THEMSELVES:
			"When is your next issue coming out?"

		THE ANSWER: "Whenever I damn well feel like releasing one!"


	On with the shouts....


There are people I would like to give personal shoutouts to because
dammit you're cool.


				Firstly to:		
		My crew @ Hack Canada - www.hackcanada.com
		"j0j0j0 my homeboys from 780. I'm down wit j00 j0!"
	        
			The HC cr3w consists of: 
		CYB0RG/ASM, The Question, Wizbone, Hex_Edit, Wildman, 
			Renderman, and I (The Clone).    


		Everyone else;
	
Mark: A telecommunications guy.
Phil: [same as above]

Lord Narayana (poz.8m.com): a phone guy.

Pinguino: (www.penguinpalace.com): Pingi!!!@!! Cool dud3tt3 I've
	  known for quite some time now. Check her page... it rules.

Rhino9 Security Team: These guys are one of the most incredible computer
 		      security professionals I've ever known about.
		      Hex_Edit of Hack Canada has some connections to them.
		      Unfortunately they no longer exist. The team broke up.
		      Too bad. ;(

Dr.Mudge (www.l0pht.com): It was an honor to meet you at DEFCON 7.0.
			  I had a nice conversation with you. Good to
			  know that the L0pht and Hack Canada crew are
			  becoming a tighter unit.

Space Rogue (www.hackernews.com), 
	       (www.l0pht.com):   Too bad I didn't get a chance to
				  speak with you at DEFCON this year.
				  Renderman did get a nice shot of you
		 				though. 	
			(see: http://nettwerk.hypermart.net/defconpics)
				   
				  

	Well this is it. Hope you enjoyed the second issue
		 	  of K-1ine. 
		      	
		I will now leave you with a message:

"Don't be such file whores. Try to read and understand the work involved 
in computer security and H/P web-sites. I don't mean lame ones
with stolen information or media whore sites (see: http://hack-net.com). 
Put something back into the hacker community. Create something. 
Research a topic, learn about it, find ways of exploiting it to a 
	 	   reasonable degree, and write about it."
