  --=[ LINK OF THE MONTH ]=--

 Every month I post one really great "link of the month" on every issue
 of K-1ine magazine. The link can be anything in the technology industry,
 music scene, rave scene, punk scene, or even a good article you read on
 a news site. I'll be taking submissions via e-mail or IRC right away; so
 get your links in and maybe you'll see it in the next issue of K-1ine!

  For the month of December, the link of the month is:

  http://project.cyberpunk.ru/

  'The Cyberpunk Project' --

 "A cyberspace well of files,
 related to those aspects of being, 
 formed by modern life and culture."

Cyberpunk Video Game Review (ShadowRun!)
by phlux for www.Nettwerked.net


According to Tony Van(the producer/designer of Shadowrun);
"Sega sub-licenced the Shadowrun IP from Data East. Due to a number of
factors, the Genesis version was completely different from Data East's
SNES version."

This review is for the Genesis version only.(my friend says its better)
Genesis version release date: Nov, 1, 1993 by DATAEAST
___________________________________________________________________________

Back of box description:
"The year is 2050 and the megacorps rule by the power of information.
Everyone is on file in the global main-frame... everyone but you and a
handful of 'invisible' outlaws called ShadowRunners.

Move through the grim and magical realities of futuristic Seattle and
uncover a diabolical plot that could destroy the world.

-Team up with spell casting mages, wire-headed deckers, or mythic orcs and
 trolls of the distant past.

-Take on a variety of ShadowRuns including: Cleaning up the streets,
 jacking into the Matrix for a big tiem cyber-heist, or pulling off a risky
 'Corporate Extraction'.

-Stalk cities in real time combat and glide through the virtual
 battlefield of the Matrix, where an encounter with Black ICE may be your
 last!"

(see shadow.jpg and shadowback.jpg for a scan of the box art &screenshots)
__________________________________________________________________________

This game is ALOT better then i thought it could be! It is based largely
from the book Neuromancer. It is a pretty complicated RPG, and as such,
it is easy to get into tight spots if you don't think things through.

It has taken alot of my time, and i still ended up using the cheat codes!

When you start the game you must choose from a Mage, Samurai, or a decker.

Magic is useless, because the real money is in the matrix, and you will be
wasting yen in the short and long run with magic when you need to be buying
wares. Magic will only help in the longterm. So choose;

-Samurai for easy difficulty.(start with hand razors, get datajack later.)

-Decker will be easier(and more fun) in the midgame.

-Mage is easier for the end game. Keep in mind you can hire upto 2 runners
 to join you.

___________________________________________________________________________
In between doing runs for Mr Johnsons(usually playing mule, intercepting
packages, or escorting) you really don't make any credits. Yet you will
get fucked up by the authorities.(put karma points in reputation/charisma
and negotiation skills early in the game)

Combine things like the NEED for good weapons, armor, wares, which is
really expensive. The money system is kind of fucked up. You will get
rolled trying to walk the streets, so keep your prioritied straight!
It is easy to waste nuyen(credits).

So when a Lonestar(5-0) catches you with an illegal gun, it will be
confiscated. So you need a duster(light armor) to conceal it.
You might be able to pay off the 5-0, or even fight them off.
Or if you have the right contacts and creds, you might be able to get a
doctored permit. :)

It is very difficult, even before you get to jack into cyberspace, but
well worth playing if you have the time, or use the cheat codes.

The game is built around a poor story, but the interesting gameplay makes
up for this and the old school graphics. I know it is like 10 years old,
but some of the repition can get annoying.

However, usually just when you think you have memorized all the
preprogrammed responses something cool happens.

___________________________________________________________________________
The vast amount of variables involved in staying alive, and making money
is what makes this game fun. Where graphics cannot set the proper tone
for a situation, words do. So it is pretty easy to get into this game...
if you can find a way of making credits!

>From One gang, i was able to buy affiliation for 1000 yen, after paying
750 just to see the boss. Then he wanted 500 to skool me on getting free
taxi rides. He social engineered me and laughed. It seems when this gang
does not get free taxi rides, the cabbie will not have a car in the
morning. :)

There is always loopholes, new contacts(making friends is expensive), and
different ways of making money.

One Johnson wanted me to do a shadowrun on this gang(he did not appreciate
their graffitti), so i ended up shooting them in their turf for 380 Yen.
Then i hired some people to join my possee, took everything from their
inventory, and dismissed them, just to hawk their shit.
(then i needed them later, and had to buy them guns to stay alive)

To get anywhere, you need to get into cyberspace...


__________
Cyberspace
Shadowruns involving hacking the in the matrix are by far the coolest,
and seem to make the most money. If you want to be a thug, you need a
possee(and supplies to take care of them), big guns, armor, cybernetics,
contacts, a good reputation, all which costs $$.

If you put all your efforts into getting a datajack, deck, wares, in the
mid game you should be allright, but...

Then you need to worry about your deck, memory, storage, etc. With the
money cheat, my deck was FILLED with the best offensive/defensive programs
that i couldn't download the prisons hardware permits, security
audits/procedure, or anything! "No Storage!"
(i did however turn off the node that controls the cameras, and disable the
alarms)

I randomly hacked some bank account numbers, and this warez kiddy wouldn't
give me shit for them! Yet he paid for some log files...

The incoherencey is what makes this game fun to play. The cyberspace
interface is very well done, the graphics are trippy, almost hypnotizing.
When you hack some Black ICE and crash some systems, it feels pretty good.
Erasing files is cool too.

Or breaking into the police department, and jacking their ICE from the
inside out, quite a bout.

I never completed the game, it gets either too boring or complex.
Im sure theres lots of shit i have yet to see.

Find this game if you think you are a cyberpunk!

________
The Good
LOTS of cool little things to get to keep you interested.

-In Little Chiba if your taking the decker path, there's cool cyberware
 (hand razors, etc)

-If you go thug, theres alot of cool guns and bombs, lots of shit to stir.

-Lots of software that makes the cyberspace cool to fuck with for abit.

-Always new people to talk to, places to go, and credits to make. The map
 is pretty big, i have yet to explore it all.

-Battery backup with 2 save game slots!

-CHEAT CODE! Hit ABBACAB when the ShadowRun title rolls across the screen.

_______
The BAD
-Kind of old school.(good or bad depending on your attention span)

-The music/sound FX can get real annoying.

-Trying to play legit is either near impossible, or will leave sores on
 your ass.

-Multiplayer would have been cool.

___________________________________________________________________________
Very good game for its time! Go rent it now.

uhm yeah i just feel bad because ive been fiending
my info-maniac-ness. no i haven't gone wigga,
for me.. mocking sanity allows me to extrapolate
the insanity. (and no im not a gay man!)

But don't feel sorry for me just cuz im a fuckin hermit,
and i don't 'get any', or because i have the shittiest
net connection, or because my room is in a quarantine.
yeah that shit holds me back, but...

im just sorry were not hacking the planet!@*(
So im going to set a goal; im going to focus on nothing
but my little wetware hacking text(which is also a good
excuse to let mepull my pud, cuz everything comes down
to the wetware hacking!;) Regardless, once i get some
of that shit out of my system, its going to be time to

get stupid!!

ooka pow
ninja now

I got enough shit and friends to worry about, so i don't
need anymore than the projects and friends i have now!

and remember...
phlux loves you!^&*@(
and don't ever think otherwise.
otherwise he might go poser on your ass

              Virtual=Third Dimension Hacking.

Introduction:
When the word 'hack' enters most anyones mind, the first thing they will liken
it too is something of a digital nature. For me, when I hack, I am trying to
exhaust all variables my problem solving skills allows, while they are in
constant assessment with my rationale.

It doesn't take long before I find myself holding my bladder until I can can
relieve myself while my computer is left with a big CPU slice to hack away at.

Then before I know it, the gut rot is back. Too much coffee? Not enough food?
Indigestion? Or maybe I just need a smoke. (nicotine does aid digestion :)
Soon I would make large feasts so i could skip snacking during times of intense
hacking.

Then I learned that much of the nutrients in large meals is wasted because
they are digested too quickly, and small snacks are *much* more efficient.
This is an example of simple wetware hack, if you will.

I also learned to counteract the gut rot of caffiene and hunger with water.
This may seem logical to anyone, but trying to make it stick was difficult!
Frequent urination, each time refilling the water bottle. However this
seemingly waste of time was very much worth the benefits hydration has to
offer, learned from experience. Most people are under hydrated, keep a water
bottle with you at *all* times and you will see a difference! Since drinking
more water now than I used to coffee, I have even more energy.

All of the above is an example of wetware hacking because I had to program
myself, and my body. Another very interesting example of wetware hacking is
that of urine therapy; the process of drinking ones own urine for health
benefits.

At first I thought this was just WRONG, but we have been conditioned to believe
this. I would gladly insert a catheter into my urethra if it meant I could remain
uninterrupted in the 3D that the Virtual Boy has to offer alongside this text.

I could also insert the catheter right up into the bladder for real-time
drainage into a vessel for consumption, if it meant I could stay inebriated
by the possibilities of the cyberspace.

As of yet, neither me nor The Clone has practised urine therapy (that I know of
anyways) although someone said it tastes like beer. Practise on cold instant
coffee, which tastes like kahlua! I have very much learned to control my gag
reflex as cold coffee ferments into something very nasty very quickly.

I find comfort in knowing I can hork a stomach full of caffiene at will without
a finger down the throat. Mind over matter is what wetware hacking is all about,
and digital hackers have an advantage, because cyberspace can be a loophole.

Think this introduction is crazy? Us too!

Now wait, what if there was one catheter in the bladder terminating into the
vessell, and then the contents are routed through and out of the gateway via a
second catheter which leads down your throat! Is that not a viable loophole?!?
______________________________________________________________________________

DISCLAIMER: Wetware hacking can be hazardous to your health! That is why the
foremost aspect should be accurate information! Google has a Web Directory for
Urine Therapy. (Health>Alternative>Urine Therapy) Please check it out before
you do anything silly. Always cross reference!

semantics are that of the oversimplified dictionary.com definitions, which
will be pasted in.

Some of these words may be psychological, spiritual, or paranormal in nature.

#Why?

The motive is infite, while the Virtual Boys mono-red display seems limiting,
it offers many possibilities. Read the intro and hardware overview from the
VB Programmers Document: http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~dbt/VBProg.html
(also mirrored@nettwerked.net)

One reason David Tucker fails to mention as to why the VB was a flop;
It was way ahead of the time, hence the price, and the unimpressive games.

The game that BEST makes usage of the 3D is Red Alarm, which I was able to
conquer in under 5 hours, straight up, no breaks.

The "Automatic Pause" option turned on by default scared people too, along
with warnings for epileptics, and children. The warnings were there so
Nintendo's lawyers would have peace of mind. Plus if you are 7 years old,
or younger, it may damage your eyes as they are not fully developed.

The automatic pause option is to give you a recomended 15minute break every
hour. In using the Virtual Boy for 3 hours straight or longer, the only
funny thing I noticed was a reality check after an immersive session.
16-bit stereo sound provided by the earbuds was rather hypnotic.

The link port-to-interface one VB with another was never manufactured, but the
hardware is there, and it is usable. This provides a good interface with a
server computer - but what about interfacing with your body?
______________
Body Interface
When you are asleep, the portion of your brain that is responsible for learning
is active.

Sleep:

A natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes
usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there
is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.

During sleep the brain in humans and other mammals undergoes a characteristic
cycle of brain-wave activity that includes intervals of dreaming.

This is why subliminal programming tapes will work with minimal effect, if at
all. Hypnosis tapes are different however, and work just fine if you are open
mind towards them.

Using the VB could allow for a combination of both. With the Voodoo Machine
(www.voodoomagickbox.com), light, sound, (taste?) and aroma therapy, altered
states of consciousness are achievable.

These states are great fun, and need exploring in the digital world!

_______________________

The Nintendo Generation
_______________________

Ever watch someone play what seems like a simple video game, say Super Mario
Brothers #1 for the NES? They will often go into a trance like state, eyes
wide open, mouth open, even bobbing their head/body as they make Mario jump.

Personally, I noticed these gamers would get *too* into the game, forgetting
it is a game, and becoming over-emotional during times of loss, and lack of
satisfaction when they did win. These kids probably have developed Attention
Defecit Disorder :)

Good arguments for people addicted to gaming include;

 - It improves hand-eye cooridination.

- Many games require+enhance problem solving skills (TETRIS).

- Getting into the gaming industry starts by an interest in video games.

- In RPG'ers especially, it expands the users vocabulary.

The advanced gamers who recieved more mental stimulation were always PRO's
at say Tetris, Fighting games, or RPGs.

In Tetris, the best player that I knew of was my mom. She could play it on the
hardest difficulty, where the blocks would fall so fast your brain would have
mere milliseconds to check the next block about to fall, and then to check the
play area, to see where it could go, and then you would have to rotate the block,
and move it to the right column, using the spare ms to check what block was going
to be next.

WordTris she was just as crazy in. With experience, anyone could program
themselves to automate the mental task of mastering tetris, perfecting
necessary millisecond thinking/application. Problem is tetris was too damn
boring. I wonder if 3D Tetris on the VB is any good?

I always thought I was the best at fighting games. In Mortal Kombat, there
was nobody I could not beat. It soon became boring because no one would
play me, and the computer opponents were too predictable, and too difficult
when you put it on MAX DIFFICULTY.

So when I did come across someone who beat me, I thought they were cheating.
And there are a lot of bugs/loopholes in video games to exploit. It was
easy getting into most opponents heads, not when I came across the rare
Mortal Kombat addict.

They had the MAX DIFFICULTY Artificial Intelligence figured out, so you
couldn't predict their moves according to their character of choice, or
style. They had the code system required to execute any move, seemingly
hardwired, like my mom had tetris wired.

So I could never play Mortal Kombat 2, or Killer Instinct, the offensive/
defensive/air/ground hit combo's would be mapped into massive flow-charts
in NES Power magazine. Naturally I discovered RPGs next...

The Role Playing Games were KING for me. Single player, varying Artificial

Intelligence/music, a real story line to keep you suckered was great too.
Super Mario RPG only took me three days straight to beat, I didn't mind
the overdue rental costs... I still never found the portal to Great Guys
Casino though :(

When I listen to my complete collection of Super Mario RPG music files (MP3),
I can't believe the repition did not drive me mad. But even with the complexity
of RPG's, if you can lose yourself in it, it feels like your getting somewhere
real cool, real fast, right?

Like how the time seems too fly out the windows, whilst hacking.
______________________________________________________________________________
trance

1: a psychological state induced by (or as if induced by) a magical incantation
[syn: enchantment, spell] 2: a state of mind in which consciousness is fragile
and voluntary action is poor or missing; a state resembling deep sleep
______________________________________________________________________________

_____

Sound
_____

An MP3 from a classic Nintendo game can induce the emotions felt while playing
the game years ago, listening to the music of a paticular level can bring back
long lost memories.

You might be able to remember one exact session where you experienced such
great joy in beating a level boss - this is associative memory in action.

Emotions can easily turn into physical reflexes. I can listen to the boss music
from Streets Of Rage 2, at the end of the second level, where you make it out
of the bar and into the alley. You have to fight Barbon, a very rude bartender
with fatal round house kicks.

It can induce an ardrenal rush if I use creative visualization. Even just by
pondering the sound of the rain falling, the music, and Barbon taunting me
to throw.

But i always had the drop on that fuck, holding it down while his crew
would jump me from behind.

Mexican stand-off.

I liked waiting for all the punks to circle about me while dancing around, boot
fucking the occasional hood that got close until I could go toe to toe with that
two story mother fucker Barbon, heaving him across the alley into the garbage cans,
only to take out his own groupies in the process. Then, finishing him off with a
knee to the genitals. NO MERCY! Heh, you get the picture.

Personally, I have used this to a more physical means by associating my hacker
gloves with intense concentration, similar to what was required for the 20 on
1 death match in that alley. Axel, my character of choice from SOR2 had similar
red gloves, which inspired me.

Plus the music in Streets of Rage 2 RULED. Therefore sound will be used to
encourage the necessary emotional states of being. And I will continue to kick
Barbons ass on MAX DIFFICULTY.

________

hypnosis

An artificially induced altered state of consciousness, characterized by
heightened suggestibility and receptivity to direction. A sleeplike condition.

The thing I like about caffeine is it literally opens my eyes. I always look
stoned; too many hours inducted by the enchantment of a screen I suppose.

When a good buzz on my FOV and POV(field/point of view) is increased, and I
have more energy to hack away at the task at hand, and my vision seems much
more clear, instantly erasing the sleep from my eyes.

Now while sitting at my desk this is bad, because one can easily be distracted
by external stimuli that will compromise the task at hand. A messy room with
neat-o stuff strewn about, or the infinity that is multi-tasking and the
Internet.

The Virtual Boy can feed both stimuli and efficiency if interfaced properly.
With extended use, caffeine or other drugs (marijuana, sugar, etc) could and
should be controlled, so as to aid the user in experiencing the entirety of
most any altered environment. Some people do not know this.

Combined with any form of meditation, a cyberspace construct hacked up on the
Virtual Boy would prove to be a magical incantation in itself.

______________________________________________________________________________
__________Meditation__________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________

The act of meditating; close or continued thought; the turning or revolving
of a subject in the mind; serious contemplation; reflection; musing.
___________________________________________________________________

Meditation can be as simple as staring at your monitor while your harddrive
clunks away, defragging, formatting, scanning, or whatever. The sound of the
head drifting over the platters can be relaxing.

When a bad cluster is found, you will hear it immediately, once the head
has advanced far enough in the process. Before long even the neophyte
computer user will see the benefits of defragging/scandisking.
The same is true with meditation.

It is as easy as self reflection while a large program compiles, or it
can be much more complex. You will be able to troubleshoot problems
with your soft or hardware. These issues may seem trite, maybe you
forgot to say thank-you to your land lady for helping you take out
your garbage. Or perhaps you have a specific phobia you would like to
overcome. Often it is as simple lack of misunderstanding.

"Maybe if I just hold that spider, in my hand, I will see no reason why
 he should have such control of my emotions. And just maybe he would not
 bite me, if I let him choose to crawl onto my palm. And if he bites,
 I most likely will not die."

Or maybe who gives a fuck?

Fear, uncertainty, doubt.

In meditation you allow time for your train of thought to coast from
thought to thought, until enlightment is achieved.

This is why talking is a very good therapy, and why e-mail can bring a
sense of fullfilment. Even if the recipient does not reply, you have
computed your thoughts and emotions in your conscious mind, rather than
let them be adrift in your subconscious. This is why irc can get so crazy.

Personally, I always try to re-read an e-mail, or a /msg to make sure it
is transmitting my message across properly. For therapy you can write a
potential e-mail as a .txt, and then re-read it later. This would save
a lot of stupid e-mailing. And when you come back and reread your e-mail,
it may be easy to see that you were not unbiased in your writing, as one
emotion seemed to dominate the overtone of the message.

Or maybe you have real life friends!

Meditating in quiet awe is extremely effective. The word meditation may
conjure an image of a yogi with a white beard, sitting cross legged
wearing ginch made from a white towel.

Personally, I recommend a good book on Ninjitsu such as; Secrets of the Ninja
by Ashida Kim ( FREE! www.ashidakim.com). It talks of the Kuji Kiri, the 9 cuts,
or "The key to the mind gate". It really does justify the logic behind the
different meditative positions/techniques. Good read.

Practice your meditation with a combination or aromatherapy. Marijuana
can be good for *some* people in clearing the mind, but try getting some
inscense. Make sure you only use the one scent during meditation. Do not
use cologne, even with good inscense you will experience smell fatigue.

Like taste fatigue, where constantly eating plain ramen is undesirable.
Now if you were to eat ramen every morning, you might look forward to
the warm broth waking you up in the morning, akin to coffee and eggs.

Even if you can not directly smell the inscense, indirectly your brain  <<
is registering, and associating the aroma with the relaxed state.
So when you first burn your flavor of choice, it will put you in the
right mindset.

Much how the video game music induces your endorphins, adrenaline and dopamine.
Finding a trigger for your adrenal gland may be hard, this is where meditation
can come in. Some triggers might not always work.

My Streets of Rage trigger is effective, because when me and Barbon would
throw down, it was for keeps. The local video gaming store at the time
had a contest going to see who could get the maximum points in level 1.
I lost because I went against my instincts, choosing Max instead of Axel :|

Ever forget your first love? Maybe it was just the first time you got
a mean endorphin fix, or fiddled with your joystick?

The brainwave machine (read Cyb0rg/asm's file @ HackCanada.com) can aid
meditation, or you can try looking at the back of your eye lids in order
to calm all thought. You will see color swirlies in the light, which may
feed your brain necessary stimuli, as it is hard to retain the idle
mindset in this crazy 'on the go' world. Try to meditate in the dark.

A hot shower/bath always helps! Don't forget the aromatic bath salts.

Breathing exercises are good if you are a smoker. Eat a candy cane or
maybe halls, or mentho gum to open your airway and promote pausitive
associations.

________
EXERCISE.
For the mental body to be healthy, and for it to operate properly, you
should have a balanced diet, and stimulis with exercise. Your exercise
should promote mental stimulation as well; like Karate or skateboarding.

I recomend the latter. Even with its explosive popularity, it still
goes against authority, if it no longer boggles the average persons mind.

Learning to apply what is seen on skate videos, while it looks easy, is
very difficult. Skateboarding can be like riding a bike. Funny thing is,
I have forgotten how to ride a bike.

Skateboarding to me is about learning new ways to physically program your
wetware, exercise is the great side effect.

Even if you cannot do tricks, skateboarding is very good transportation as
The Plague demonstrates in the movie "HACKERS".

Before you know it you will be standing ontop of a phone booth, balancing
on one foot, arms bent upwards in the air, ready to jump kick at a moments
notice. And you won't need to eat the sushi!

Phlux's every-time 0h day trick tip(TELE-Skarate):

Balance on top of a phone booth, Karate Kid style. With the one leg in the
air, the skateboard should be balanced on, until it is kicked into the
air. Jump off the phone booth landing on the the skateboard. Roll away.

Practise doing the TELE-Skarate kick off of a ledge untill enlightenment
is achieved. (loophole: Blind 9ply deck+gummie wheels! Helmet?)

DISCLAIMER: If you practise TELE-Skarete and hit your head on a payphone
and become an amnesiac; I will show you how it is done. Just ask.

In (Europe? I can't remember) a decal of a fly was placed in the toilet
bowls of a mens restroom. This resulted in making the janitors job easier.
Hand/eye cooridination? Or hand/eye/penis?

Multi-tasking your brain is hard, just like pee'ing and skating.
Practice! Practice! Practice! And don't give up.

______________

The Contructs?
______________

So if we are going to use the programming techniques that exploited our
wetware... to recompile, memory associations should be the easy part.

As this is a group project between Phlux and The Clone, we will need to
agree on the associations. We both grew up in the Nintendo generation,
so old school MIDIs will be great. Donkey Kong aquatic levels had very
soothing music.

To promote the proper state of consciousness, the Virtual Boy is well
suited to handle light therapy, and our GUI. 50hz scan rate, and mono
red graphics is perfect. Colours might be distracting, on that note:

There are two ways to go about inducing the different states, read
Cyb0rg/asm's Brain-Wave Machine file if you haven't already!

So we can go with the easier, sensory deprivation, say just the
Virtual Boy and some appropriate music. The unit could be portable
with a laptop, and you could take it with you to the bath/hot tub.

Or we can go all out, with crude AI. What does one hope to achieve?

mnemonics;

The art of memory; a system of precepts and rules intended to assist
the memory; artificial memory.

adj.
Relating to, assisting, or intended to assist the memory.

n.
A device, such as a formula or rhyme, used as an aid in remembering.


Speech synthesis would be great for super-learning programs.

Remember the game Number Munchers? I actually learned some math from
that game, but not flash cards. What about area code munchers, prefix
munchers? What if we incorporated DTMF, and had DTMF Matrix Munchers?

With proper algorithms, some spiffy GUI, you could learn to decode
DTMF by ear, remember important phone numbers, recite learned
strings of numbers, and watch out for Freddy the Fone Fraud Fox!

Maybe he could cuss at you in the Telus/Bell/AT&T/Verizon automated
operator voice, by cutting up the phonetics as .wav's, and putting them
back together. A SIT (special information tone, get SIT.TXT from HackCanada)
would be appropriate for a dramatic death.

If you've ever downloaded a morse code training program, you most likely
found it very boring. (However, I recomend SuperMorse for DOS)

The memory techniques used are effective, but in the end I realized I
really had no use for learning morse code other then 'it might be cool'.
So I tried to loophole my brain by marking the dits and dahs on my keyboard
with a permenant marker.

Of course the friction wore it off, but it was effective. I often sit in odd
positions with the cordless keyboard, (homerow is for pussies!) so even
glancing helped. This, because I wasnt trying so hard, like *trying* to
study for a pop quiz after a nite of hacking.

Even in grade 5 I found myself exploiting All The Right Type's AI by going
into max difficulty, using one hand to type a few screens of:

fff jjj fff jjj fff jjj fff jjj ff jj ff jj ff jj fjfj fjfj fjfj fff jjj
..however the testing was aranged.

In a matter of milliseconds, you would have a mad high score!

Is your typing a subconscious act? Can you speak french fluently? If you
can carry on a conversation en francais, you would be deemed fluent.
Can you IRC without looking at the keyboard? Do you ever find your fingers
replacing words your conscious mind really meant to type?

<phlux> phlux in tha house.
<theclone> so i had cyber sex with Mabelle last nite
<theclone> uhh i mean Helga.
<phlux> HAH owned.

Obviously clone wishes he wasn't cybering helga, but Mabelle instead.
This is a common occurrence of free association (automagick writing).
The Clone's fingers were probably on the keyboard after he thought of what
he wanted to say, but he was watching VHS pornography, so his fingers did
the talking.

Of course this can happen vocally, and with any word. On the deck I commonl
mix 'this' with 'shit', 'god' for 'dog', their, there, they're, etc, etc.

What of the deck? Our conjured cyberspace surely will need some input!

One handed keyboards work using chord.
_____
chord;
Any collection and arrangement in a condensed form of many particulars or
values, for ready reference, as of weights, measures, currency, specific
gravities, etc.;

Also; a series of numbers following some law, and expressing particular
values corresponding to certain other numbers on which they depend, and by
means of which they are taken out for use in computations; as, tables of
logarithms, sines, tangents, squares, cubes, etc.; annuity tables; interest
tables; astronomical tables, etc.

(d) (Palmistry) The arrangement or disposition of the lines which appear on
the inside of the hand.

Word on the street is they only take a few hours to learn, unlike QWERTY!

With experience, proper R&D, logarithms, it should be easy using the one
<<logarithms?? handed keyboard for data input. If you are right handed, buy
a left handed model so you can use your *cough* mouse at the same time.

Another idea for input is voice recognition, a lash mic would be cool.
SWAT uses them to amplify their whispers, they are expensive, but keywords
would be all one would need.

The NES PowerGlove could be used to associate hand signs with different
programs. Could even be used to learn SWAT Handsigns, or with mods, it
could be used to teach sign language, and decode it. A left handed data
glove would need to be constructed as lefty PowerGloves are rare.

Hell, you could even use 3D effectively to learn Kung Fu, like Neo. Proper
balance, slow-mo, technique, and a 2-player gang bang mode might do it.
Books are too be studied, cyberspace could train.

I had an interesting experience in grade 5 that relates. I was goaltending
for a game of soccer, only we used a tennis ball for some reason, and
sometimes it was acceptable for the goalies to use their jackets as
stoppers.

The ball was coming right at me from about 20 feet, like Sub Zero from
Mortal Kombat throwing an ice blast. This ball was going to hit me right
between the eyes, but before i could think my reflexes kicked in.

Instead of ducking, or strafing, I raised my arms and crossed them at the
wrist and the ball bounced straight off the side of my forearm. My clenched
fists shielded my eyes, my wrists protecting both nose and mouth.
When someone shouted 'Nice ninja move!', I instantly realized that what I
did was the same blocking move used in Mortal Kombat 1! I even put my left
foot back, for balance, just like in the video game (SEGA@#$).

The electronic stimulation by means of a Voodoo Machine (voodoomagickbox.com)
and monitoring of your heart beat, but be fun with AI. Say in an ardrenal
rush, verified by your heartbeat, the stim could be cranked. I think it might
be annoying if one was in constant quo of their heartrate by ear. Proof of
concept; Blakestone! If you played that game, you know what I mean. Perhaps
for a *cough* 3D shooter of its time, it was appropriate psychologically,
but not for the proposed application herein :)

Now books are great, but speed reading is hard to perfect. Different fonts,
colours, styles of writing, run on sentences, slang, acronyms, outside
disruption. Many things can affect a good read.

3D can really take advantage of speed reading if the Virtual Boy was to
be used terminal style. The cartridge would need a perfected font, and
the shadow in 3D can highlight the groupings of words, as told by basic AI
from a server. Maybe they could scroll like the intro to a Star Wars movie?

The small screen resolution is compensated by the MindDrive. By thinking
either "left" or "right", you could scroll text across the screen with ease
thanks to the MindDrive.

Speech synthesis could aid the process if a proper voice was used, but this
could be disruptive depending on the interface in use. Say text floating on
a 3D starfield simulation or endless wormhole, where the pixels are inducing
the necessary brainwaves. Subtle trance music would make for a nice setting.

Clips of certain speech might best be used in a different GUI. Download
the music video Windowlicker by Aphex Twin. Observe the almost too well
acted characters, and their ebonics. This music video NEVER gets old, it
is pleasing to both the eyes and ear.

Imagine speed reading this text file on a Virtual Boy (as best as you could:)
and hearing the characer with the long hair say:

'straight up nigga'
'da fuck goin on up in this bitch'
'turn this mutha fucka around foo'
'its on up in this mutha fucka'
'slow yo roll'
'slow down nigga'
'handle dis bidness'
'wha da fuck ya talkin about'
'lets roll and do dis shit'
'go get it on'

This guys ebonics could be used quietly in the backround, say if there was
/msg awaiting you on icq.

Through the left ear, the user might hear 'slow yo roll!', instantly
grabbing attention. A simple thought of either 'left' for backup, as in
investigate the action corresponding to a specific voice syhnth. Or simply
thinking 'right' to advance uninterrupted to the task at hand.

'da fuck goin on up in this bitch' might be of higher priority, and if
ignored, 'handle dis bidness', etc, etc.

Kingping has some good speech to be ripped(i think?)

Sprites can be made from screenshots of like music videos, and programmed
to the cart for nifty subliminals.

With earbud microphones, surround sound headphones overtop, and a
subwoofer, possibilities are paramount! But choreography is a must!

Lets get back to...

Perhaps a version of DTMF Munchers should include spelling words via the
keypad. Like adding big numbers in your head, it is difficult to look at a
word and see its DTMF equivelants. Check phonespell.org :) that would be
a great skill for remembering phone numbers.

The DTMF matrix can be expanded on like mad. Im sure theres other wetware
modem'ing techniques that have yet to be contemplated.

Two users could communicate under the influence of cyberspace, with DTMF
keypads, the PowerGloves keypad, or (I would prefer) a numeric keypad.
A light pen/graphics tablet for a virtual *cough* white board, or recognition
to convert the writing, handsigns, or spoken communication into DTMF
so as not to infringe on the experience.

One would just need to be immersed in the infinite combo's of possibility!
_________

Expanding on DTMF mnemonics
________

Binaural Beats are the basis here. When one ear decodes a frequency,
and the right a different frequency, your brain tries to resolve the two
differentiating frequencies. The right and left hemispheres of your brain
will register a third phantom signal; this signal is the difference of
the two frequencies.

So if your left ear hears 697hz, and the right 1209hz, the third signal,
a binarual beat is registered as 512hz. You do not hear it however, its
all just in your head.

Precise toning of your brain in this way stimulates the brains olvary
nucleus to resonate to the binaural beat, in the above case, a DTMF 1.

A signal is then sent to your cerebral cortex merging with existing
patterns of neural activity. This produces elite mind altering and
expanding changes, including learning.

Infact, left/right hemisphere brain stimulation via transferable thinking
skills training is used to help amnesiacs.
http://www.bdainternationalconference.org/presentations/thu_s7_d_7.htm

The algorithm I conceived is partially jacked from ITU-T(CCITT);
Recommendation V.18 1994, Procedures for starting sessions of data
transmission over the general switched telephone network. Annex B;
DTMF Operational Mode, half-duplex.

The letter A in Binaural DTMF would have the low tone played through
the left ear; 697Hz, and the high tone 1336hz through the right,
a DTMF 2.

The letter B would have the low side of the DTMF played through the
left ear, and the high side through the right, as above, but precedessing
the DTMF 2 would be a DTMF *.


       1209Hz   1336Hz  1477Hz  1633Hz
       _____     ABC     DEF
697Hz [__1__]  [__2__] [__3__]    A

        GHI     JKL      MNO
770Hz [__4__] [__5__]  [__6__]    B

        PRS     TUV      WXY

                OPER
941Hz [__*__] [__0__]  [__#__]    D

Four of the DTMF lettering keys would be rpefixed with a * to denote
character spacing, and the other four lettered DTMF keys with a #.

So to spell BAD you would play a DTMF 2, low tone left ear, high tone
right ear. 2=B

For the A, it is *B

And then a single DTMF 3 for D, because the letter D is the first character
on the 3 key of a standard touchtone keypad.

To play an F, you play a double ** first and then a 3. This way your brain
associates 4 of the DTMF keys with the * or # to denote letter spacing,
look at the ASCII art above if your confused :)

This algorithm leaves the unmarked 1 and 0 keys open for use of police 10
codes. Open season on the A B C D keys!

It is crazy, crazy enough to work. Hence emphasis on associative memory :)

The future for VR is brighter then you think! The technology out there
already is fucking crazy, and is only going to get more effecient,
effective, compact, and cheaper! The possibilities in home brew VR are
many! I encourage you to check out the following to see how you can use
VR hardware/technology in whatever application you cna concieve;

http://www.howstuffworks.com/augmented-reality.htm

quote: "Gaming - How cool would it be to take video games outside?
The game could be projected onto the real world around you, and you
could, literally, be in it as one of the characters. One Australian
researcher has created a prototype game that combines *QUAKE*, a popular
video game, with augmented reality. He put a model of a university
campus into the game's software. Now, when he uses this system, the
game surrounds him as he walks across campus."
