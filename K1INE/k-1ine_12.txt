-- Introduction

 
  Welcome to the February 2001 issue (#12) of K-1ine zine, once again
I am your editor and chief architect - The Clone - bringing you another
great compilation of writings from various people in the Canadian 
hacking and phreaking community. Before you go sending off that e-mail
to me asking why I didn't submit anything for this issue, the answer
is simple; been working too much to be able to finish off the articles
I was planning to put in here. But by next month I promise you I'll have
two supa-dope philes for you all in K-1ine 13 to intake faster than cocaine
at a Telus Corporate employee dinner party.

Enjoy ~

News; Brand new web-site venture
`-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-

[02.16.01]

- The Clone

  This month I've taken on several other web-site development projects
while Nettwerked has stayed down for technical maintenance ...

		 'Alt.Phreaking FAQ official web-site'

Get all the answers to the questions you've always asked yourself while
lurking around on the USENET newsgroup; 'alt.phreaking'. Originally
started by telco-guru 'Seuss', the alt.phreaking faq has grown into a 
several hundred page Q&A guide for newbies and telecom enthusiasts alike,
and just this month was passed onto me for permanent bi-monthly updating.

		     http://members.tripod.com/SeusslyOne

			  'Fuck Rogers AT&T'

The name says it all - Fuck Rogers AT&T is site for the wireless phreak
to spread knowledge about the technical infrastructure of Rogers/AT&T's
TDMA/Analog cellular network, as well as a place for irrate (former) customers
to rant about why they think the service Rogers/AT&T offers just plain sucks.

This site features the following sections:

security advisories / files, rants, message board, and hosted sites.

		     http://www.fuckrogersatt.com

--
  			  'TRAPFONE'

Still undergoing major construction, TRAPFONE is a site for the wireless phreak
to spread knowledge about the technical infrastructure of TRACFONE's analog
cross-country cellular network, but mainly as a place for irrate (former)
customers to rant about why they think the service TRACFONE offers just 
plain sucks.

E-mail; British Telecom Record Manipulation 
`-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=-.-=

[02.16.01]

An interesting e-mail I received last week on potential British Telecom
Record Manipulation... hell it could be just another beiger fuckin' with
this poor girl. At any rate, I felt it deserved to be in this issue of K-1ine.

- I don't know a lot about the way British Telecom handles it's billing
  record keeping system, but if its security is anything like Canadian
  and the American phone system then the likelyhood of records being
  altered is rather slim, BUT if anyone who framed her knows about the
  security of the telephone like myself and my associates do, then yes
  call log altering is completely possible.

Is there anyone out there who could tell us if it is possible for BT Phone

- There is a device that is widely used by phone techs and phone phreaks
  alike, which goes by the official name of "buttset", also known as
  "linemens handset" and most commonly called 'beige box' by the
  underground community. By hooking up this device which is, in simplest
  terms a "hand set with an alligator clip on the red wire and alligator
  clip on the green" which is hooked up to the phone box outside of
  peoples houses to set the QoS (Quality of Service) of a line, and by
  phreaks to tap lines, and by criminals to make fraudulant calls. This
  is probably what was used to make those phone calls that the young lady
  you represent is now in allegations over.
  I recommend you check for any signs of tampering by looking at the
  phone box outside of her house... any forced entry into the box for one,
  open the box up wearing gloves (the persons finger prints are likely on 
    them, don't want yours there too), and look at the wires... if any of
  the wires (green/red) were stripped then you have your answer.

  Do not hesitate to use this as a defence, BT has a history of dealing
  with these types of situations though they don't like to admit it to
  the public ("us vulnerable? NEVER!"). Good luck, and write me back
  if you have any more news. I'd like to know how this turns out.

What is Gravitational Engineering?

Gravitational Engineering is, simply put, the manipulation of gravity
through means other than the movement of masses. In order to understand how
this would be possible one must first begin to understand the nature of
gravity. What is it? How does it work? In 1916, Einstein came up with his
theory of gravity called General Relativity. In GR gravitation is no longer
a force acting through space, from one mass to another, but rather a local
effect. That is to say a massive object creates a curvature of space and
time. Objects then follow the geodesics of this warped geometry. As John
Archibald Wheeler put it "mass tells space how to curve, and space tells
mass how to move"

The second major theory to come about in this time period is Quantum
Mechanics. A theory describing the nature of matter and energy at small
distance scales. In quantum mechanics we no longer talk about particles
having definite position and momentum, rather we deal with probabilities.
The behaviour of matter is governed by the Schrödinger wave equation in the
non relativistic case, and quantum field theory in the relativistic one.
Without going into the details surrounding both of these theories it
sufficient to say that they have contradictory viewpoints when it comes to
gravity. Quantum field theory roughly describes forces as an exchange of
virtual particles, whereas gravitation is described as being purely
geometric. The recasting of relativity theory in light of the quantum
description is one of the major challenges of modern physics. Out of the
unification of quantum theory and general relativity will come a new
understanding of the fundamental nature of space and time. Once we begin to
understand the interaction between geometry and matter it is hoped that we
can control it.

It is the goal of this Institute to bring together researchers and
scientists from around the world in pursuit of this knowledge and to seek
what benefits can be gained by it.

The Battle for your PC

We are coming to a crossroads my friends, a point where Corporate America is
trying to take control of your machine early days of computing and even up
to now, these machines have been empowering. Now I know not everyone uses
every feature or knows the intimate detail of how their computer works. Some
of us just use them for the basics, games, e-mail, web browsing and word
processing. Others write code and have control over every single aspect of
their processors from speed to output channels ... right down to the arcane
knowledge of assembly. Regardless, the power to do as you please is there.
To me, my computer is my territory. What is on it is mine, not somebody
else's.  Corporate America, no friend to personal liberty would like to see
this changed. They don't want you to have control over your
computer ... rather, like the governments and people they manipulate, they'd
like to see it as their property. In the past several months several schemes
have come out. There has been talk of building hard drives with copy
protection built in, software that encrypts the signals sent to your sound
card, and even encryption of the video signal going to your monitor.
Microsoft's latest offering while chocked full of bells and whistles has one
built in feature they gloss over. Copy protection built right into the OS.
Rumour has it that you will only be able to install the OS 50 or so times
and that either every installation, or the 50th time you'll have to phone MS
to get permission to reload it.
What's more, various forms of licenceware are coming out (Office XP) that
force upgrades and upgrade charges on you, whether you need them or not.
Macs aren't invulnerable to this trend either. Their writable DVD device
won't allow copying of various programs and DVDs. It doesn't matter if
you're just making a backup copy, or even time shifting a TV program, the
hardware won't let you. That being said, the hardware also won't let you
copy protect your own works. If I produce a video and want to protect it, I
can't. Only the members of the RIAA and other media corporations have this
ability.
The seemingly obvious answer to this is to simply not buy the corporateware
that's being pushed. Yet in order to run the programs, browsers, games, etc
that are out there you may be forced to. Try browsing the web in lynx or old
versions of IE and Netscape). Worse yet, the average user isn't going to
have the savvy to know when they are buying crippled hard/software, and that
is the majority of what will be offered.
It is up to those in the open source community to find ways around this, to
ensure that hardware without corporate control is still available, and that
OSs like Linux become easier to use and competitive with the likes of
Microsoft. These companies are relying on the fact that there will be no
competition. Something that is completely against the capitalist spirit. I
as a consumer should have the right to choose whether or not I want built in
copy protection. These companies want to ensure that I don't have that
choice.
This is a wake up call to everyone out there. Lest you find yourself paying
rent to use your own computer.

Security Camera Looping


[Intro]

	Walk into any public area and your sure to find many of them. Now, hypothetically speaking 
of course, lets say that you are wanting to access a payphone in an area lacking in people like a 
parking garage. the only thing from hindering you in your adventure is that camera. Heres a way to 
avoid being identified without cutting the cables to the camera, disabling it completely.

[Body]
	In general, security cameras do not have the greatest resolution so the chances of you 
cutting in modifying the display and having it noticed are greatly reduced. as mentioned above you 
can simple cut the cables but why arouse suspicion when all you may be doing is inserting a tap into
a payphone. 

	First off your going to need a camcorder to do this failing that a VCR and access to A.C 
power it can be done just impractical. Next, you'll need things like a pair of wire strippers, a 
screwdriver, extra wire, a "Y" plug (a Y shaped cord that attaches to digital and most analogue 
camcorders allowing you to view what's on the tape on a TV) that will be destroyed so it would be 
wise to buy another one, and lastly a friend to stay back, out of view to watch the camera. 

Most important is to find out when the busiest hours of the parking garage are so as not to do this 
at that time. After that it would be wise to find out when security does their rounds, this 
information can be found quite simply by calling the company or the city, which ever runs the 
security, and simply asking. 

	Prior to you need to strip the wires of the Y plug and attach a pair of alligator clips,
much like a beige box. Now to the camera, you need to find what's called the "Access Panel" where
technicians patch in to fix/install the security system. Mind you your only going to need the 
camera access panel unless you want to do other things such as disable the phone/lights/power but
these aren't necessary and may just attract unneeded heat. 

	The panel for the camera is a silver rectangular shaped panel secured to the wall/pole with
the same screws use to secure the ceiling in millennium phone booths, which are quite easy to remove
using a small flathead screwdriver. Now once you have it open here is how you create the looping 
effect. As soon as you remove the panel you will notice a few  wires (if your camera happens to be
in a pole then all that will remain are the camera wire(s) and the power source for the lamp) within
the panel used for other things within the system. All you need are the white and yellow ones. Once
locating the needed wires splice them but be carefully not to cut through, then with the camera on
attach the wire(s). Remember there may only be one relevant wire for the camera because most are not
equipped with sound. now what you need to do is hit record and tape a few moments of film. Preferably
footage without moving people/cars/etc. After this is done unplug and review the film, if all it set
well and there isn't a time stamp in the corner then re-attach and hit play. The camera should 
override the signal sending the data your inputing instead of film of you in the top of a payphone.
Now to back track a little if the film does have a time stamp, then it would be wise to come back 
the next day and attach and hit play at the same relative time as to what is on the display, however
this is not entirely nesessary.

[Closing Statement]
	
When you are finished doing whatever it was you were doing close everything up
and leave it as it was. If by chance this did not work then mostly you completely
disabled the camera which won't make much of a difference if you stole a payphone, 
I think someone would notice the missing phone whereas with a tap the case may 
be different.

			'December 6'

I often wonder why we are put here.  I mean we go through life not knowing 
what tomorrow will bring; we suffer from all sorts of problems like disease, 
disaster, loss, and death.  We fear tomorrow's coming and worry about what 
happened yesterday.  We've lost all sense of security from society, and lies 
are so common, you don't know whom to trust.  People are constantly changing 
and you never know how they will react to you.  Weapons are a fad and drugs 
are cool.  Peer pressure is normal and not taken seriously anymore.  Kids 
don't care about it and parents are either blind to it or they don't discuss 
it enough.  Society isn't made up of true people who are honest and good 
anymore; it's made up of people who wear masks and act like everyone else.  
They aren't themselves; they are what people want them to be.  They will 
tell you what you want to hear even it isn't the truth.  It's not often when 
you meet a person who shows their true selves and isn't afraid to do it.  
You don't meet a lot of honest people, or people who talk with any sort of 
intelligence behind their words.  Half the time people talk just to hear 
themselves, and they don't even understand it or know why they are saying 
it.  These people I can certainly do without.  We have to choose our friends 
wisely now and watch what we say.  People react in such a way today, that 
even the smallest thing could set them off.  People are killed for stupid 
reasons, and fighting is cool with kids.  If you're different then you are a 
loser, even if you are a good kid with good grades.  That part doesn't 
matter anymore.  If you look like them, talk like them, and act like them, 
then your in.  It's an easy concept.  Hide your true self, put on your 
second face and forget about the person who you were... you're cool now.  
Right?  Wrong... those people might make it far in life, and be rich or 
famous, but in the long run they won't be truly happy.  Their happiness is 
fake, what money buy's will sooner or later be gone.  It's being happy with 
yourself that will get you through.  And you can't be happy with yourself if 
you hide it under a mask.  It might work for some, but certainly not many.  
People take things for granted and don't really see the important things.  
Addicts live for the next high, not noticing things around them, or looking 
at who they are stepping on in the process of finding their next hit.  
Alcoholics look for their next drink not seeing what they are doing to them 
selves or loved ones.  They can't look past the glass or see through that 
high, and see that every swig or every hit that they take is a form of slow 
suicide, but for them I guess that the thrill of the buzz or that taste of 
that high is enough for them.  Who they hurt in the process proves doesn't 
really matter to then, they have what they want and that's all that matters. 
  Nobody is perfect, and I don't expect anyone to be.  If we knew everything 
and if we were perfect then there wouldn't be a point of living.  This is 
all one big learning experience, and it goes back to the first part.  We are 
here to experience all this stuff in life, and learn everything we can, but 
why?  Just for the experience?  I just don't understand why we need to go 
through this if we aren't going to be around anyways.  But I figure there is 
a reason, and I'm going to do my best.  Even if I don't' get anything more 
than knowing that I tried my best, lived my life the way I wanted to, and I 
was myself, I will be happy.  I am happier now than I was a year ago, and I 
think I'm finally figuring my life out.

Namezero Fun -or- Ridding your Domain of Corporate waste (c) p1asm1c 2001
--------------------------------------------------------

So you've finally made you're incredibly l33t homepage and are ready to 
publish it, but what's this? NBCi/Fortunecity don't approve of your 
kerberos security 'notes', packet sniffer collection, or password lists? 

(I suggest www.f2s.com for a decent host to redirect to)=20
Unfortunately all our friends at namezero offer is a redirecting domain, 
nevertheless having a domain of your own (albeit redirecting) can come 
in handy.

So to get started, go on over to www.namezero.com and sign up, use
plausible information (even if fake), as they seem to watch over the 
applications with a close eye these days. You'll receive a conformation 
e-mail, and after that (2-4 weeks) a welcome e-mail. You're now ready to 
use your brand new domain! But wait.... there's a 2 inch high tampon 
commercial beneath your uberl33t site.

But this can be remedied, after a few hours of searching, a loophole was 
found.

Once your domain is registered you can configure your site and the 
address it redirects to. This information is entered at
(controlpanel.'your Namezero domain goes here'.com/net/org)
Here you can enter the redirecting address and a 'description' for your 
site.  

Enter your password and click on homepage,  and enter the code below:

"></head><frameset rows=3D"100%,*" border=3D0 frameborder=3D0 
framespacing=3D0 framecolor=3D"#FF00FF"><frame src=3D"http://your real 
host goes here"><frame></frameset></html>  =20

The same method can be used for subdomains (called 'bookmarks' at your 
Namezero domain, simply click advanced for the subdomain and you'll once 
again have the description box, then just use the code listed below.
Explanation:

Basically the way this works is once someone goes to your domain, they 
receive a page at Namezero, with your page in one frame, and ads for
toiletries, 'N Sync Concert Announcements, Easy Bake Oven Ads and other 
garbage in the other.

The key to the exploit is the description box (basically anything 
entered into this box is inserted into the meta tags of the above 
mentioned page).

Since they don't filter out actually html tags in the field, with a 
little handy-work you can alter the page from scratch, eliminating the ad 
bar.

Start with a closing quote and right bracket (terminating the metatag, 
and you're free to code the rest of the page. So just put the code below 
into that box and your page will be displayed in all its glory...

			Telus OCA IP Hijacking


Being the first text I ever contribute to this zine, I am afraid that this 
information is already well-known to us Alberta/BC lads. However, for the 
ones who've been spaced out..
 
Our local telco, Telus, has been in this ADSL business for quite some time, and
they have changed their rental equipment(i.e. ADSL modems for users): from 
Motorola CyberSurfer to Cisco 675e router, and then now 3com "HomeConnect" 
modem, which is by far the shittiest ADSL router in terms of stability.
 
Anyhow, if you've been paying attention to our old k-1ine issues & HC articles,
there is an sploit on hijacking IP addresses from your neighbours and etc.
To prevent such activities, 3Com has come up with a new interface;

http://oca.ab.hsia.telus.net

The site lets users to log in and register their NIC's MAC address, and then
issues IP address. (Before the IP you'd get is 10.xxx.xx.xx, etc)
 
The problem now is with Telus(as always). They have this default password 'telus
99' or 'telus00'. They occasionally do, however, ask you to set the password
for your account, but that's your TELUS account password (the stuff you put
in on their lame ass webmail), NOT this oca site password. (I spent 
countless hours on oca site trying to figure out what da hell happened to 
my passwd)

So what is it worth, you say? Well, not all residential ADSL users use 2 boxes. In fact,
not all users are even aware that they get 2 IPs for what they're paying, which
leaves us free IPs. If you're one of my type, lazy as hell, and don't 
wanna set up a router for 1 more IP, you might get away with another poor 
telus customer's IP.

Who knows, you're never smart enough to set up a router so you just wanna 
steal other people's IP even if you have like 15 boxes running on your 
network. (why would any sane person do that?)

* Loggin in:
-------------
1. go to http://oca.ab.hsia.telus.net (use nutscape, M$IE, Mozilla, whatever 
   that's capable of Java; more on this later)

2. put in your victim's username and default passwd.

3. on Main Menu, go to "Manual Registration and Administration of PC's and
   Devices".

4. there, you see 2 text forms to put in your NIC's MAC address. Use the one
   that's empty (or something like 0:0:0:0:0). 

5. click on 'submit' on the left frame and see the "Mac Address is registerd
   successfully" message.

6. go to #hackcanada @ irc.at0mix.net and let others know how 31334 you 
   are.. and k-line .. ugh..



/* FYI "When a normal Mark Renton calls troubleshoots"  ********************************************/

*dials 310-tech*
*listens to the e-slut rep's answering machine, presses 1, 2 for the high 
speed technical support*

"Telus Technical support, Sickboy speaking."
"Ugh.. my internet don't work"
"okay, what's your username?"
"David" (FYI, 'david' uses default passwd 'telus00')
"Is the modem lights on?"
"Ugh yes, its green lights are on"
"okay Mr.Renton, could you please hold"

*Sickboy trys to check the connection by connecting to Renton's ADSL modem*

"The connection seems to be fine. Could you try 'winipcfg' and tell me 
what your MAC address and IP?"

*Renton tells the MAC and IP*

"Okay, <in a true big-headed poser tone> it seems to be some other MAC 
address's been registered in our network. I will reset the password to 
your account, so that no more break-in would be possible" "Wow, thank you 
very much!" "No problemo, it's part of our telus high-speed internet service."

/****************************************************************************************************/


* You don't want this happen to your poor Mark Renton. So don't delete the 
MAC address that's already filled in and put yours. IOW, use your common 
sense.

** interesting fact: If they issue an IP to your machine A, you can go back to
oca.ab.hsia.telus.net and delete machine A's MAC address, and put in machine 
B's MAC address in the same field, register, and both machine A and B will 
have the connection to the net, until you reboot the machine.

*** I have yet to figure out how to code in java or any scripting.
Coders out there, you can write a script to pull out a list of users with 
the default password.
