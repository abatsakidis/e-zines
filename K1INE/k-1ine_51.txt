the receptionists are to additional social engineering, this is for you to
find out.
==========


Calaway Park is in area code 403 about 20 minutes out of calgary... down that
way where Canada olympic park is. (www.calawaypark.com)

CALAWAY PARK 
245033 Range Road 33
Calgary, Alberta, Canada T3Z 2E9
Phone: (403) 240-3822 Fax: (403) 242-3885

240-3822 is the main number. You can reach telephones from within the park,
on their PBX from this number.

There is only 5(6?) payphones in the park. Last i saw they were Telus
Centurions. The first one is found right before the main entrance, the next
one (last i saw there was two beside each other, one with a malfunctioning
hopper..) They are just on the other side of the entrance turnstyles gate.
(Right outside the Hud Stones gift store)

The next one is by the market place games area (look for the golden goblet
game, you can't miss it.) It is between the bathrooms.

The next one is next to the Terace Garden. You can always ask the receptionist
for a local call near the park entrance.

Just get a paper map from somewhere, ask the employees.

,,
As always, when you see a phone inside the vicinity of the park, look for the
large orange/black sticker with a 3 digit number. This is the extension
number. There is a cabinet behind the Burger Hut, behind the white fence.
Bring a garbage bag with you for the dumpster so as not to look suspicious.

The actual key system's location may or may not be in this large cabinet. It
is a secluded location, however. You're on your own here.

The intercomm that plays music is actually controlled by some DJ (rumour is
it's in the warehouse this is unconfirmed) and apparently he just spins CDs.
I don't remember if the key system is used to bust in on the music, you can
find out very easily. "ive been looking for my little sister for 3 hours"
(goto the guest services booth).

They may just phone security who in turn uses the CB radio system to
communicate with the security guys. Bring your CB radio and bust in on their
air space. They use common 10-codes. Some "sani's" (sanitation monkeys, the
14 year olds) have CB radios.

Security shouldn't be fucked with. 173 will get you a security guy sitting in
a booth at the employee entrance. He has a TV and a CB radio, and is
considered base station. All employees entering the park are logged, also
leaving. All telephone calls are also logged. You can try eaves-dropping with
your CB, and see what you can social engineer.

You could get a few names of the suite monkeys and phone security, saying that
you're from telus doing repair on the payphones, and you were told to use the
back entrance. Cruise the parking lot until you see the booth. Contemplate the
world.

The games.

They're all rip-offs. Don't play them unless you're trying to get snatch from
your girlfriend. Some games are based on skill, most are chance, some are
fluke.

The dart throwing game is sure fire unless you're a fucking loser. It costs a
bit to trade up the animals, but it's a sure investment unless you're a
fucking loser.

Tin can alley looks easy but is not. Stay away.

Golden goblet is a good random game, if you win, it's probably something
decent.

The ring toss (them little red rings have to land on the neck of an antique
cock bottle) is fucking near impossible no matter how you throw them. I've
thrown two handfuls from those fucking baskets and not one ring mated a
bottle.

The best is bushell basket. Throwing baseballs into a basket mounted on a wall
looks easy, or difficult, depending on your logic. Most people think the trick
is, the springs in the bottom of the basket that aren't there. Throwing the
ball so its point of apogee is equal to the height of the basket is difficult.
The trick is to stand NOT in front of the basket but to the side. Use a side
arm toss and throw the ball into the basket so that it will roll up and around
and come to a rest. No bouncing. Just don't stand in front of the fucking
thing.

That water gun game isn't fair. One gun seems to have more pressure then the
others, for many different reasons which i care not to go into. Observe which
gun has the most pressure as it will shoot straighter and more accurate. If
the operator doesn't state you can't double team (two people squirting one
target) then do so. The rules sign doesn't forbid against this, and unless you
were explicitly told before the game has started, the customer is in the
right. Just ask to speak to someone with the shiney gold name tag.

_*_
Food.

Employees get a discount, go through the door near the entrance with the
first-aid sign on it, walk past the first-aid office and down the stairs on
your right. This is the employee lounge. Buy food cheaper here, uniform is not
required because you're new and haven't gotten it yet. There is a payphone
down here too, although this area is most often heavily trafficked, mostly
with managers and shit. Get your food and book.

Calaway park sells Those Little Donuts, and they certainly are orgasmic. The
scam is all that oil, as soon as the donuts begin to loose their warmth they
turn hard, into a rock stage where they are not consumable. Eat them fast.

+....
Other

The trout pond is a piss-hole. Cheat and bring your own bait. Make sure it is
white like the dough you are given. Get the longest pole and drop your hook
into the water, slowly pull the bait straight up, 6 inches below the surface,
and then slacken the line and let the bait fall down, repeat this process as
it taunts the already insane fish, they want to die.

The fish are fed every morning, try later in the day. When you catch one, ask
the operator if you can kill the fish (they club it on the head with a pipe).

 The Story Of The Centurion

___________________
 As told by phlux;
phlux@fucktelus.com

_______________
 Introduction;
This txt will document various experiences I had dealing with one paticular
centurion payphone in my area, along with other information regarding it.
I have compiled it in story form, inspired by theclone and RTs txt of
similar nature. Also i find txts are much more enjoyable when i can read them
in somewhat of a story, in the writers own words. It is in some sense like
i was a part of their experience, and therefore more interesting rather
then a generic txt giving the 0h day shit, straight up.

If you don't like it, fuck me, and read it anyways, you may learn something.

_____________________________________________________________________________
Our story begins, with phlux in a car, being driven to his new home, in a
small town in 780, Alberta. I am driven a small tour of this small town.

My parents tell me, "there's a bar, post office, an elementary school for
the little ones..."

I interupt them "is there a payphone?" i ask as we drive by the payphone.

"yup... but that's about it"...

I quickly notice that the payphone is a Telus Centurion, the brown box sort.
It is housed in a wall type freestanding booth, offering little housing.
Little did I know what adventures would be had at this phone. Some might
seem of little significance, but they're all memories. And all memories are
treasured in due time.

Sometime shortly after unpacking, i take a walk to the payphone. Not having
anyone to call, or any money to call anyone, i dial 311, the local telus
ANAC. "7..8..0..X..X..X......" (number ommitted for security reasons)....
I then dial the telus ring back, 570.XXX.XXXX, the sound of the mechanical
bell is somewhat pleasing as i've not heard one in quite sometime, and also
because it sounds somewhat different than standard mechanical ringers, as it
is housed in the thick armoring.

Not knowing what else i could call.. i decided to try the ring back again.
And then again, a few times... one last time i called, and as the phone rung
i walked away. As i turn my back, the phone suprises me... "RIIIINNNNGGGG"
the first ring was prominent as usual, however the second one was moreso a
half ring, with the end of the ring trailing off, it sounded really cool, it
was as though the ringer was dying out. The third ring was very quiet, and
much shorter.

I pickup the handset, listened to the test tone, and then proceed to call the
ring back again, flash hooking and looking at the phone, waiting. Right when
i thought i had killed the bell, i hear the slightest tingle of the bell.
It was so quiet, and only partial. I try once more, and this is repeated.

I walk home trying to think what just happened...

I don't visit the payphone until sometime passes. I don't really remember
this time period too well, but I will merge a legit log of a conversation
that took place on irc. Note this log is completely unedited. At this time I
was going through another nick phase, in the log i am obvisouly zur and pooly
being a good friend of mine. Greets to pooly.

<zur> this centurion ive been playin with is totally fucked
<zur> the hopper is all FUCKER
<zur> i make a legit all with coins.. .and the hopper doesnt empty it out
 into the cash box
<pooly> it gave ur money bakc
<zur> then if i fuck around with the phone long enough... hitting the hangup
 switch.. pressing buttons makin cool tones
<pooly> ?
<zur> it gave more
<zur> yea
<zur> when i fuck around

<zur> it empties the hopper
<pooly> heh
<zur> today i made 70cents
<pooly> that's cool
<zur> a few days ago about 5 bucks
<zur> and
<pooly> i thought about stuffing phones as a job
<zur> if i dial a ring back number... i get a quarter of a ring and its very
 faint...
<zur> then nothing
<zur> and i did that 3 times
<zur> come back to it like 45 min later
<zur> it wont do it
<zur> coincidentally the lights to the booth dont work
<zur> i think its got some kinda power problem
<zur> as i recall the op can empty the hopperinto coin return with voltage
 modulation
<zur> so maybe when i was fucking around it got a lil surge and interpreted
 it as a coin return thinger?
<zur> like a green box?

<pooly> i dunno
<zur> fuck
<zur> i wanna know wtf is goin on
<zur> yea and i was babysitting for this hot bitch and her bra is lyin around
 the house and its a DD 36
<zur> but anyways
<zur> she goes
<zur> "dont let the kids stay up past 9:30"
<zur> but like she isnt back yet
<zur> so i dunno if she wanted me to wait for her?
<zur> or just walk home after theyre in bd??
<zur> bed
<zur> any fucking ideas?
<pooly> you should wait
<zur> at her place?
<pooly> maybe she'll give u extra cash
<pooly> ya
<zur> or some fucking head

<zur> hmm
<zur> i dont think that bra was hers
<zur> shes got nice knockers
<zur> but not DD 36
<zur> or whatever
<zur> but head is always nice
<pooly> or she'll let u poke her knockers with weiner
<zur> k i fucking better get back over there.. the fucked payphone is across
 the street ne ways
<zur> heh yea tit fucking is some good
<zur> hehe i ill bring all the change that cocksucker gave me
<zur> cya dude
<pooly> heh

I remember now, the payphone had emptied its hopper on me more then once.
It would happen when i just fucked around with it, dialing ring backs, INWATS,
maybe an ANAC.. I recall when i would get a VMB or some other DTMF sensitive
automated operator, if i couldn't crack the password or even get to a
password prompt, i would mash the keypad.

In some sense, it didn't suprise me when i would hit 2 keys at the same time
and hear a non DTMF telephone tone, but at the same time it did as the
called partys recording got dimmer.

After fucking around, doing shit like that, when i would press the hookswitch
to release the line, this was when the hopper would empty, also one time
i believe it was when i was dialing the ring back, and i went to hookflash
then the hopper would give me its gold. The sound of multiple coins gushing
through the coin return chute from the hopper was much more enjoyed then the
actual profits.

>From then on, i tried to make regular trips to the payphone, wanting to know
why, what happened, when it happened, knowing it had much to offer.

I recall being somewhat idle in the phreaking scene, in the sense of actually
doing stuff, but i remained active in keeping 'updated' to some degree, and
also maintaining an online presence. I would generally use the payphone
to checkout some numbers i had acquired.

I got dropped docs to a 'private' teleconf, hosted by some familiar people in
the scene, not knowing what it had to offer, i grabbed my skateboarded and
headed to the payphone without thinking twice, opdiverting in, the conference
wasn't all too interesting.

I sat on the slanted base of the open housing designed to hold the phonebook.
When i stood up, i realized there was a huge fucking spider, using the phones
cover for housing. I hate spiders so i freaked out, i was sitting and this
fucker was a few inches away from my head. I tried to stand on the other side
of the booth, but the armored cabling connecting the handset was too short.
Still being startled by the spiders mere presence, i booked, also TRON
is a lamer, and not a good host.

In spite of this, after having gone home, realizing my associate operative
agent would be on the conference, i skated back to the payphone to call in.
He wasn't in, so i ended up just lurking for a bit, and then i threw the
handset at that fucking spider, fucked up his web good. I hit the hook switch
to save conf time, and skated away, the handset dangling. TRON is a lamer.

Simple experiences like this made my daily interaction with this payphone
somehow imperable. I tried to devise notes of phone numbers to call. Some
were from skans, some i had acquired from friends, or however i got them,
all the interesting ones went on documented.

Finding a pen was one thing, so I found it just as easy to scratch phone
numbers, using a screwdriver on a floppy disk with bad sectors, writing
the digits on cigarette pack tin foil works well with a phillips head.
One time i even wrote a conference pin # on the side of the actual booth
with a rock, this also worked well. It seemed other people had this idea
as well.

With these trips, i dialed many numbers, usually collect calls where you
don't have to speak with an operator. Collect calling is a great way to check
out a long distance phone number, assuming it doesn't have a collect block.
However i have never boxed a call from the payphone...

Interestingly enough, I found that when i first got to the payphone, my first
local call would be free, and any after, i would get that nasty intercept
recording. I hate that bitches voice.

These free local calls, i couldn't really explain.. my guess was that they
were the cause of the coins in the hopper, left unaccounted for, and left
up to me to account for them.

A week or two ago, if i recall correctly, i got pretty pissed off with the
centurion. The light in the booth didn't work, not only making it a bitch
to read numbers i had brought with me.. But also because i wanted to
try out my acoustic coupler, not having a laptop, i considered packing
my 386, and a small 9" monochrome orange MDA monitor to the payphone in a
duffle bag, using the AC from the light to power this operation. Not sure
if the light just burnt out or if there was other problems, i called 611
one morning after much thought.

The centurion did many things i found interesting. The above, also when
releasing the line, and going off hook, before a dialtone was heard, there
would be a few clicks, usually 2 or 3, sometimes 4, all with static in
between. Sometimes i swear i could hear a voice in these clicks.

Lately, there would be a constant 4 clicks before i would get a dialtone,
and when dialing PBXs/extenders/etc, when being connected to a tie trunk,
it was quite prominent, in the sense that i could hear 1-2 clicks with the
static while being transfered. Usually from 800.646.0000 (telus dial around
ops which i often use for collect calls) while being transfered to the actual
system from the "welcome to telus" or variant message.

Telus was pissing me off at the time (and still is) so i walked to the
centurion one morning, and my first call was to that of telus repair, 611.
I reported that the payphone did weird things, it was often staticy (as it
was) and the lights on the booth didn't light and this caused much grief
as i couldn't read the numbers off my telus calling card. (yeah right!)

"I didn't even know there was a payphone here because i always traveled past
 in the dark! I only found it in the daylight..."

A week had passed when i realized the payphone granted unlimited free local
calling, when i realized this, i spent a fair bit of time at the phone.
A week later, after having completed an all niter, i skated down to the
centurion, with a few numbers in mind to call, one being fairly important,
in regards to a job as my dad was on our single landline.

The moment i picked up the handset something seemed odd, as i dialed 411
i noticed a new armored cable, it was much longer, and not as thick as the
original. I pulled the handset away from my ear, and there was indeed a new
handset. I continued with my call, got the number i needed and proceeded to
dial it.

"your call could not be completed as dialed... please check the number, read
 the instruction card, or dial 0 for assistance, thank you from telus..."

I immediately threw the handset at the keypad, if this phone had a leg, it
would kick me right in the fucking nuts. I hit the hook switch a few times,
it made a single click, the dialtone was very clear.

Next i dialed the ring back, the ringing startled me ... i never learned
exactly how long it would take for the ring back to do its work, as the
"old" centurion was unpredictable; sometimes, the ring back wouldn't work,
and i could pick up the handset and hear the test tone, it had in fact worked
the phone just didnt bother to let me know. Other times the ringing would
be delayed, or the ring would be extremely faint.

After the second ring from the repaired payphone, which was answered with
haste, i quickly pressed the hook switch, and released just as fast, and i was
greeted with a dialtone. I listened to it for a bit thinking what to call.
It was always what, rarely who.

Telus operators weren't really people were they?
I called the telus automated dialaround, 800.646.0000, and placed a collect
call, the line was very clean, as the call was routed, i didn't have anything
to call... so i went home.

Today, September 14, 2001 i've come to terms with the centurion.
Looking for information, while high on information, i tried to pull up
information for my fellow centurion.

Many documents on newer phones, the millennium, elcotels, paytels...
No avail. Re-reading the other payphone information, i wondered if it were
possible for a line seizing exploit to be carried out on the brown box??


I found something rather interesting, according to payphone-directory.org
a series of 130v pulses is used to signal coin return, and coin collect at
the end of the call.

This is somewhat correct, if a local call were placed, and the called
party answered, the hopper would empty its contents to the cash box.
So the pulses that would be sent at the END of the call would be a coin
return if a NIS, busy, or number of that sort was reached.

This pseudo green boxing 'technique' obviously has something to do with the
problems the centurion had before it was repaired.

I could not find any documentation on the centurions required loop line
current, but when i find a good multimeter (my $20 Canadian Tire piece
wouldn't do the trick..) i will get a reading of the current line current.

Before i phoned repair, the loop current must have been quite high, as I
experienced various problems with the phone including, cut offs (i assumed
it was the handset, this was true some of the time), cross talk was heard
sometimes, i was able to hear squealing, and generally just shitty quality.

Also, i quite often got alot of circuit failures, and even now with the phone
'repaired' (the fucker didn't fix up the light) i can not reach any numbers
prefixed with 310, which should be toll free anywhere in alberta, and as I
understand, other areas.

Oh well at least i won't have to worry about standing near spiders that aren't
there because of the extended armored cabling.

In the phones previous state, 310 was reached with no problem.
Im going to slap some resisters on that line, fuck telus.

Also, i believe it possible for the centurion to be exploited using a line
seizing sort of 'attack'. Stay tuned, as i bend telus over bare.

This file pertains to Loops in the form of wiring, commonly called 
a pair, the twisted pair, or just the "line" and/or "phone line".

Normally Analyzing a loop requires a 250$ multimeter from Radio Shack
with a serial cable(phlux style anyways), or a toner/probe set, 
and other tools, which are usually expensive.

One can easily overcome this with a telephone patch cable, or even just
an RJ-11 mod(female) jack(jill?) on your wall.

By simply touching the ring(red) and tip(green) wires on your tongue,
a short is created, and your tongue is the load in some sense. If the
pair that you analyzed is onhook, you will feel a zap, and the area of 
your tongue that you electrocuted will be numb for a bit.

When a line is idle (onhook) there is generaly 40~volts across ring and 
tip, and you will learn to 'taste' this.

If an extension on the pair is off hook, there will generaly be around
9~ volts on the pair. There is only a mild sensation (on my pair anyways)
much like licking a 9 volt battery at full capacity.

You will easily be able to tell the difference as to wether or not your
line is idle or not, by the self inflicted electrocution. With a powerful
short, your reflexes act faster then your hand, and your head will pull
back as you remove the wires/mod jack from your tongue. Keep this in mind
when licking raw terminals from an open baseboard style mod jack setup.
(with 2 lines and 4 terminals in those little plastic boxes, this can
 be a challenge.)

This technique is also good for testing the integrity of Radio Shacks
"WebLock Phone Lock" part #279-8511 where there is a single female mod
jack on a surface wall mount plate with a physical key lock as the
on/off switch. If it is determined that there is no current, one can 
quickly unscrew the cover and rewire.

I find this technique a lot faster then most conventional methods, and 
therefore it is suited for the field.

One thing you need to keep in mind is that the voltage across the pair
when the line is being rung, it is around 90volts. If you were just
touching a pair with 90 volts going through, i'm sure you would be fine,
however your tongue is a better conducter then your skin.

ASCII diagram of a tongue and the taste buds(guideline):
(grade 7 science rules!)
 
 |xx         xx|

 |##         ##|
 |###       ###|
 'S#         #S
  'SSSSSSSSSS'
      ' - '
Legend:
the "x" 's denote taste buds that are sensitive to sourness
the "#" 's denote taste buds that are sensitive to saltyness
the "S" 's denote taste buds that are sensitive to sweetness

The middle portion of the tongue (Fillform papillae) are sensitive to
sour flavors. 

Personally i found the # region of the tongue to be the best portion to 
electrocute as it's not as sensitive as the very tip or frontal portion of 
the tongue. Keep this in mind if you don't want your tongue numbed...
(it really isn't that bad) A spare 9v can serve as practice.

_____________________________________________________________________/

Licking a twisted pair and not a mod jack(if you do, make sure it's a
male one fag) allows for more control over the electrocution.
When you get good you will be able to grab any pair/patch/mod
and check its state and you may wonder how you did without.

_____
Notes:
-Avoid analyzing mod jacks, as it's harder to press your tongue into
 the slits, stay away from female mod connectors(resist!)

-Avoid analyzing foreign pairs as a ring could be fatal.

-During analysis, always avoid using the tip of the tongue.

-Stay away from digital lines, if in doubt the multimeter ye shall
 bust out.

	 Constructing a marijuana pipe out of a payphone handset

 By: Phlux

 A pay-telephone handset is indeed an artifact to anyone who owns one,
 aside from making nunchucks, one can easily construct a marijuana pipe
 from such a handset (assuming its made out of bakelite, find one that
 is or you're a sand nigger). The innards should be removed, the blue
 flexible piece is optional, I would remove it for cleaner tokes but
 this is optional depending on your ethnic origin. The handset and the
 2 screw on covers are to be boiled in water to kill any bacteria that
 might affect your drug paraphenalia. A screen is to be tied to the
 inside of the earpiece screw cover, where there should only be 6 holes
 in a cluster arrangement no larger then the circumference of a screen.
 Two wires from the screen should be carefully unwoven, so that when the
 screen is placed on the inside (NOT OUTSIDE!) of the screw on earpiece,
 the wires can be threaded through the screen and the holes of the earpiece
 so they can be tie wrapped on, much like a button on a shirt. You now have
 a normal looking telephone handset which can be used to smoke decent size
 one hitters, and hash - place a ball of hash in the middle hole, hold the
 handset to the side(at a slite over-vertical slant) putting your lips to
 the hole where the armored cable was, holding a small lighter flame near
 the hash, effectively vaporizing it for consumption.

Cyberpunk Video Game Review (ShadowRun!)
by phlux for www.Nettwerked.net


According to Tony Van(the producer/designer of Shadowrun);
"Sega sub-licenced the Shadowrun IP from Data East. Due to a number of
factors, the Genesis version was completely different from Data East's
SNES version."

This review is for the Genesis version only.(my friend says its better)
Genesis version release date: Nov, 1, 1993 by DATAEAST
___________________________________________________________________________

Back of box description:
"The year is 2050 and the megacorps rule by the power of information.
Everyone is on file in the global main-frame... everyone but you and a
handful of 'invisible' outlaws called ShadowRunners.

Move through the grim and magical realities of futuristic Seattle and
uncover a diabolical plot that could destroy the world.

-Team up with spell casting mages, wire-headed deckers, or mythic orcs and
 trolls of the distant past.

-Take on a variety of ShadowRuns including: Cleaning up the streets,
 jacking into the Matrix for a big tiem cyber-heist, or pulling off a risky
 'Corporate Extraction'.

-Stalk cities in real time combat and glide through the virtual
 battlefield of the Matrix, where an encounter with Black ICE may be your
 last!"

(see shadow.jpg and shadowback.jpg for a scan of the box art &screenshots)
__________________________________________________________________________

This game is ALOT better then i thought it could be! It is based largely
from the book Neuromancer. It is a pretty complicated RPG, and as such,
it is easy to get into tight spots if you don't think things through.

It has taken alot of my time, and i still ended up using the cheat codes!

When you start the game you must choose from a Mage, Samurai, or a decker.

Magic is useless, because the real money is in the matrix, and you will be
wasting yen in the short and long run with magic when you need to be buying
wares. Magic will only help in the longterm. So choose;

-Samurai for easy difficulty.(start with hand razors, get datajack later.)

-Decker will be easier(and more fun) in the midgame.

-Mage is easier for the end game. Keep in mind you can hire upto 2 runners
 to join you.

___________________________________________________________________________
In between doing runs for Mr Johnsons(usually playing mule, intercepting
packages, or escorting) you really don't make any credits. Yet you will
get fucked up by the authorities.(put karma points in reputation/charisma
and negotiation skills early in the game)

Combine things like the NEED for good weapons, armor, wares, which is
really expensive. The money system is kind of fucked up. You will get
rolled trying to walk the streets, so keep your prioritied straight!
It is easy to waste nuyen(credits).

So when a Lonestar(5-0) catches you with an illegal gun, it will be
confiscated. So you need a duster(light armor) to conceal it.
You might be able to pay off the 5-0, or even fight them off.
Or if you have the right contacts and creds, you might be able to get a
doctored permit. :)

It is very difficult, even before you get to jack into cyberspace, but
well worth playing if you have the time, or use the cheat codes.

The game is built around a poor story, but the interesting gameplay makes
up for this and the old school graphics. I know it is like 10 years old,
but some of the repition can get annoying.

However, usually just when you think you have memorized all the
preprogrammed responses something cool happens.

___________________________________________________________________________
The vast amount of variables involved in staying alive, and making money
is what makes this game fun. Where graphics cannot set the proper tone
for a situation, words do. So it is pretty easy to get into this game...
if you can find a way of making credits!

>From One gang, i was able to buy affiliation for 1000 yen, after paying
750 just to see the boss. Then he wanted 500 to skool me on getting free
taxi rides. He social engineered me and laughed. It seems when this gang
does not get free taxi rides, the cabbie will not have a car in the
morning. :)

There is always loopholes, new contacts(making friends is expensive), and
different ways of making money.

One Johnson wanted me to do a shadowrun on this gang(he did not appreciate
their graffitti), so i ended up shooting them in their turf for 380 Yen.
Then i hired some people to join my possee, took everything from their
inventory, and dismissed them, just to hawk their shit.
(then i needed them later, and had to buy them guns to stay alive)

To get anywhere, you need to get into cyberspace...


__________
Cyberspace
Shadowruns involving hacking the in the matrix are by far the coolest,
and seem to make the most money. If you want to be a thug, you need a
possee(and supplies to take care of them), big guns, armor, cybernetics,
contacts, a good reputation, all which costs $$.

If you put all your efforts into getting a datajack, deck, wares, in the
mid game you should be allright, but...

Then you need to worry about your deck, memory, storage, etc. With the
money cheat, my deck was FILLED with the best offensive/defensive programs
that i couldn't download the prisons hardware permits, security
audits/procedure, or anything! "No Storage!"
(i did however turn off the node that controls the cameras, and disable the
alarms)

I randomly hacked some bank account numbers, and this warez kiddy wouldn't
give me shit for them! Yet he paid for some log files...

The incoherencey is what makes this game fun to play. The cyberspace
interface is very well done, the graphics are trippy, almost hypnotizing.
When you hack some Black ICE and crash some systems, it feels pretty good.
Erasing files is cool too.

Or breaking into the police department, and jacking their ICE from the
inside out, quite a bout.

I never completed the game, it gets either too boring or complex.
Im sure theres lots of shit i have yet to see.

Find this game if you think you are a cyberpunk!

________
The Good
LOTS of cool little things to get to keep you interested.

-In Little Chiba if your taking the decker path, there's cool cyberware
 (hand razors, etc)

-If you go thug, theres alot of cool guns and bombs, lots of shit to stir.

-Lots of software that makes the cyberspace cool to fuck with for abit.

-Always new people to talk to, places to go, and credits to make. The map
 is pretty big, i have yet to explore it all.

-Battery backup with 2 save game slots!

-CHEAT CODE! Hit ABBACAB when the ShadowRun title rolls across the screen.

_______
The BAD
-Kind of old school.(good or bad depending on your attention span)

-The music/sound FX can get real annoying.

-Trying to play legit is either near impossible, or will leave sores on
 your ass.

-Multiplayer would have been cool.

___________________________________________________________________________
Very good game for its time! Go rent it now.

.......................,
What is closet hacking?:
.......................:

Closet hacking is the act of personal computing within a closet.
A terminal can be fit inside a closet, be it just the monitor(s)
and keyboard(s),or the entire setup with subwoofer and all,closet
hacking should appeal to some people. Here are some reasons why:

-Stealth/Security , if you are evading someone, chances are they
 won't look in the closet. In a raid, when you hear "ROOM CLEAR"
 wait until no one is in the room and book out the window hoping
 the place isn't surrounded, or that you can escape it by running
 like hell.

-Closets hot box perfectly.(black lighting should be installed)

-In some cases, there is room for multiple hackers, or systems.
 (rack mounting on the overhead shelf if applicable)

-Fun. It is like the clubhouse you never had.

-Good for local multiplayer gaming, ensures no cheating.

The purpose of closet hacking is to create an enjoyable, and in
some cases, an effecient computing experience. For me it's the
way my sub rumbles the closet walls, and the inability to see my
monitor though the smoke that makes closet hacking so appealing.

...........................,
Why become a closet hacker?:

If the above section leaves you still asking this question then
piss up a rope. Fuckin clausi.

My closet is portable, basically its a big wooden box:

This set up allows me extended comfort for long term use, and use of multiple
monitors. I spent New Years eve/day in my closet, only problem was my monitor
lost alance atop my case and fell as I was exiting.

In this scenario, this was the only time my old school logitech wireless
keyboard shined! It's not bulky like the new ones with Internet keys and shit,
so it worked good. The only thing I didn't like is the monitor being so close
to my eyes as my closet is rather small. Luckily it has a zoom-out function;
LCD/laptop monitor use would be optimal.

There was still room for various paraphernalia, and a telephone.

In a really small closet, the CPU could be outside the closet concealed.
Wireless tech could be used for networking. A low-cost fix would be to use 
infrared. Transmitters and reciever plans are readily available on the net.
For most effecient use, you should completely clear out your closet, and
experiment with different set ups and seeing what works best for you.

Some things to keep in mind: excessive heat - you may want to outfit your
computer with an airflow package with air filters. If you have a nice hot box 
going and don't want to break it, you should stock bottled beverages. 

NOTE: beer bottles make poor urinals. They don't hold as much as you may think
they do. Learn from your mistakes while perfecting closet hacking skill.

Black lighting in the enclosed space is highly effective for closet set ups.

.......,
Closing:

Well I could go on giving more ideas, but half the fun is doing things your
own way as you go. Personaly I would like to rig up an LED alarms/control
panel. Now I am completely agoraphobic, so being in my closet with the
computer and everything I need makes it all seem really secure. There is less
distractions and it is easy to hide from friends and family.

If you do a closet hacking setup, be sure and take a picture of it to motivate
friends to join in on the fun of hermetics (also e-mail it to me!)

the explanation:
# = rerouted parallel/serial/modem/a/c adapter ports and such.

(hidden from view); the swivel attached to the
metal spine and the actual booth needs to be removed.
in its place(by the hole left from the swivel) another hole
should be drilled beside it, this way you can use another key lock
and attach a big ass chain, so you can chain the
whole fucking thing somewhere, or just hang it
from your neck/shoulder like one of those hippie note book
cases. Idealy it should be concealed by a trenchcoat.

or you chould just wrap the chain around the
book itself and use the front hinged cover key lock
marked in the ascii and strap it to your body or something.
or you could just use the locks already inplace for the
shoulder strap, but 2 combos and 2 key locks would be
moresecure in some situations.
______________________________________
considerations: measure twice cut once.
your going to need to need to reroute the laptops fan duct,
i/o, floppy drive, etc. Therefore this project is best suited
for a field phreaking hax0r laptough book arrangement of the sorts
and not for playing counter strike on. oh a track ball set in to the
glued pages would be sexy

If the hole cut into the one half of the phone book is
offset to the right, and the plastic phone book cover is met
with a hot knife, the PCMCIA slut should still be accessible.
a tunnel may need to be had, and long fingers to access
the floppy drive shoould it not be able to be expanded out
of its bay.

The phone book pages need to be cut clean, use a vice/clamps and a jig
saw with a fine blade, go slow. Use epoxy on the inside of the
hole. slop that shit all around, make it look cool.
(but dont glue the fucking covers so they cant open)
maybe weldbond could help somewhere here?

you will want to make sure the hole is just perfect, so your
laptop can rest in the hole flush, if your lazy you will want
to keep the laptop removable. or if your a real tinker fuck 
make the hole bigger, and silicone the fuckin laptop in there
to absorb shock and trauma.

The other (ideal)route expressed is to make the pay phone book
assembly one with the laptop. Therefore only part of the phone
book hole hack job will be epoxy'ed and the bottom portion
of the phone book will be loose pages, so you can lift up
the middle solid pages, and access the battery, bottoms up.

The i/o ports, modem, floppy drive, pcmcia will need their
own holes/rerouting/cosmetic surgery and all that to make
things usable, but i think the effort would pay off in the
end. atleast it would look fucking cool, and you could
swing it around your head and club people with it

other ideas: embed a trauma sensor and a pay as you go (disposable?)
cellphone so if you chain link your laptop to a fence and someone
tries to kick it or something your pager will go off with 911 or
something. get one of those 130db personal alarms to embed if there
is room.

oh man i would find room for a fuckin acoustic coupler too

handskan.txt
Hand skanning information and source code
..................................................................

I wrote handjob.bas for personal use. As such it is a very simple
program to aid in hand skanning sequentally, saving output as
handskan.txt

Features:
-"Blind Mode"; Re-maps numeric keypad, DTMF style.
 (idealy, for use with brainwave machine, see;
  hackcanada.com/homegrown/wetware/brainwave
-Logs the time spent scanning

Considering........................................................
A modem routine would aid speed, assuming you have headphones
to plug into your modem. Then random scanning could then be
implemented. I have read some txt's mentioning random scanning as
being safer, this is no longer true.

An SS#7 node enroute will detect random or sequential scanning
as a killer trunk, and a switchman will get a trouble ticket.
Killer trunks are dysfunctional in that they will terminate
properly, but not maintain a connection. Usually they just 'fix
themselves', but extended scanning/wardialing sessions will be
cause for attention.

Response time or the priority of such a trouble ticket to a
particular switchman is irrelevant. In Alberta Canada--according
to my phonebook-- you have nothing to fear.

Now, if you are selling anything, you need a telemarketing permit.
If you phone abunch of people and just hangup to see whats on the
other end, that will get you in trouble. You must have intent
to communicate. If you use handjob.bas to aid you in logging,
spend the time to say hi or whatever, and apologize for misdialing.

Even if Mr. Telco does give you a ring ring, you can then say, hey,
ain't no thing. You merely forgot your friends number, and thought
it would be faster to dial X amount of numbers to get ahold
of him/her. (be sure and tell them you have yet to reach your
imaginary friend so you are not giving up yet.
(no dont really tell them he/she/they are/is imaginary))

The math says 10,000 numbers could be dialed @20sec per number in
2days 4hrs 30min if completed without breaks. One day, i am going
to scan some toll free prefix in under 3 days, and see if Telus
leaves for me some funny voice mails. Anyone want to race?
First one to 5000 wins the other persons 0hday!
(after they've finished their half, ofcourse)

Long distance scanning can be a cake walk if you ask your mom to
buy you a phone card that supports the *** or some king of 'backup'
command to place another call, so you are saved redialing the
extender. I imagine the carrier would frown upon this, so go with
a larger company.



Props to the Canadians for tolerating my antics.
Shouts to the HackCanada crew and associates for support.

Tips for extended periods of scanning................................

Blind mode mnemonics: Using the following mnemonics as a legend for
the output you can use the numeric keypad, DTMF style to specify
what was reached.


[A]utomated Attendant(answer machine)
[B]usy
[C]arrier


[D]isconnected
[E]xtender

[S]IT
[T]one(s)

[V]oice Mail


e[X]tender
[W]ARE[Z]

The pseudo re-mapping is compliant with ITU-T Recomendations(E-Series):

  1     2      3
       ABC    DEF

  4     5      6
 GHI   JKL    MNO

  7     8      9
PQRS   TUV    WXYZ

  *     0      #

This will save some time in the long run when you encounter
a block of numbers that are not in use.
You might consider reefing a keypad from a telephone to replace the
numeric keypad. Voice recognition is another fun idea.

I recomend reading the book;
The Power Of Concentration available from guttenberg.org [Etext #1570]

While you might not get to talk to many people in scanning after hours,
i find this is a good time to develop my female voice. Now, i have a
very deep voice, with practise i have been able to pull off a convincing
chick instead of just a granny. This is obviously beneficial for social
engineering. You might start by humming at a higher pitch till you find
the correct modulation, you will then be able to keep any manhood out of
your feminized voice while expressing female laughter and emotion.
The difference between the average male voice and the average female voice
is only about 1/2 octave. Its not the pitch, but the resonance.
Reference;
I concur with http://heartcorps.com/journeys/voice.htm for the most part,
but with practise you should not need to pay for such lessons.

As you may already know, sitting in one position for too long is not
comfortable. You can develop a Repititive Strain Injury from hacking
and in this case, phreaking.

You may not feel the pain/strain as your mind is inundated by other,
more important datum. Here is a url with simple pictures and descriptions
of some integral stretches to prevent RSI and prolong comfort;

The Ice Hooter: One hit shit!
by phlux

Well i've never seen plans for an ice hooter anywhere, which
is unfortunate. They are pretty fucking rude.

Blade hits are very effective, and combined with the ice hooter,
your weed can last quite some time. As the title suggests, even
some jag off weed can be turned into some one hit shit.

First make some ice cubes, use a tray that makes the larger cubes.

Clean a 2 litre plastic pop bottle, and cut the bottom off where
the sucky ASCII art depicts;

    ----  <-neck
    ____  
   '    '
  /      \
  |      | <-indentation, where label begins
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |  __  |<-bottom indentation, cut here
  \_/  \_/

Now punch a decent sized hole in each of the nipples
Put the ice cubes in the upturned top portion of the bottle,
and use the bottom to hold them in place, wrapping flexible
middle plastic of the bottle back, holding it all together..
like so;

   ---- <-weed smoke comes out here
   ____
  'cCcC'
 / ____ \  c is the cubes
 |/    \|
 *      * <-plastic rolled back

If you spend abit of time wrapping back the plastic, you should
get a good seal, some pliers may help. If you want to take it
up a notch, score the area with some sand paper or whatever,
and use hot glue. Dont make too big of a hooter, otherwise
you will be inhaling unnecessary air. With a good seal you
can fill the hooter with a little water.

You can serve up some big hot knife hits, and as you're inhaling,
you will wonder if it is just air, as the smoke will be hidden
within the fogged plastic.

It goes down nice and easy. Keep inhaling, and don't exhale
till you can't hold it in any longer.

When you exhale, you should cough and hack, gasping for air
half way through exhaling. This is a good sign of a good toke.

The ice hooter is good for hypoxia tokes, idealy with some good
hash or oil. Take a little toke, but hold it in till you pass out.

Holding your breath till you pass out is not a danger if you are
healthy, with a lung full of weed smoke it is just fun.(according
to my grade 9 science teacher, minus the weed bit)
However, if you don't wake up after doing this, I will not be held
liable. Therefore,  I would save this toke for special occasions.
Your lungs can't be too happy about taking in an entire toke either..

I have never had such an intense body high as my first hypoxia toke.
It is fucking wild.
Bury your chin in your chest to hold the toke, do not hold
your breath with your throat muscles, this is not good.
Only do this in a safe place like on a couch or bed, when you
pass out, your muscles will breifly spasm much to the delight
of the audience.

Expect to experience a short period of amnesia after doing this..
for me it was maybe 2 minutes, but I couldn't even remember who
I was or where I was, or who the people were that were laughing
at me once I remembered I had ears!

Rather then running around and then having someone bear hug you
into never never land, this is a better way of embedding sigils.

If you have trouble holding your breath, have a friend press the
side of his hands tightly around your neck, including, and only
the pinkies, constricting blood flow to the brain, but with no
pressure on the throat. Naturally this should be easier when
your are already a little intoxicated.

A japanese strangle(sleeper) hold would work well, ensuring the
person has safe arrival to the floor.

 I have also heard such tokes beind called wall tokes, as the
recipient can alternatively stand against the wall, and the
assistant(s) can lull the person onto the floor, ensuring s/he
does not fall backwards.

During a dry spell(if your ice hooter has seen alot of use)
you could try melting the ice cubes and drinking the water.
Let me know how that goes eh

If you have power lungs, the ice hooter is also good for doing
nostril tokes. Enjoy!

stashie.txt December 8 2006
Brought to you by Suicide Hackers
http://www.SuicideHackers.com

Written by phlux

I have always had a fascination with cases for things, in particular, stashes.
When i smoked weed all the time, i was all about the sneak-a-tokes.
This txt file will tell you how to make a good stash out of a couple packages
of good old B&H. Benson and Hedges. Lets talk about some other stashes.

On ebay and in some stores, you can get can stashes. A very authentic looking
pop can can screw open, or a can of some sort of cleaning solution. You can
get book safes, and even a stash in an electrical outlet.

I have seen cufflink stashes on ebay and ring stashes. You can get a shoebox
looking stash that locks, and the key is concealed in a panel, or there is a
board you remove to flip the lock open.

Some screwdrivers have a stash in the handle that can be over looked. You
could use lock tite on the threads so it would take more force to open, but
this is not as good as other stashes.

Also on ebay, you can get stash belt buckles. Some of them are good, these
ones use magnets and can prolly hold some cigarettes. Others are cheap, and
have obvious buttons, or hinges/springs/seams visible. 

DC, the skate company, I think they just manufacture clothes, they made a
belt i saw in white, that had a zippered pocket on the inner belt.

Circa, another skate company that makes shoes and such like DC, they had the
CM 901 or 902 shoe, maybe both, that had a zippered stash in the tongue of the
shoe.

If you are not canadian, and not a fed, email root@suicidehackers.com for
another good workable stash, as this text file uses canadian packages of flip
top cigarettes.

Now, i do not condone drugs of any kind. Not even marijuana anymore. If you do
not use smoking tobacco, dont start now! It is HIGHLY addictive, and very
dirty. Lungs do not like being poisoned with smoke. You can get asthma and
cancer, and it can get worse.

The investment for this stash is approximately 20$ if you are in alberta.
Buy two packs of Benson and Hedges, get Special King Size, these are good
virginia cigarettes in a black and gold pack. Gold border gold writing black
square on the front, and flip top. 25 pack.

The new branding for these cigarettes is a gold B&H on a black square on the
filter instead of a printed gold B&H on the tube, they just changed the
branding, not the smokes. If you like these cigarettes but think the slims are
bitch sticks, you might be able to get B&H special in a regular smoke, i've
seen them before 3 years ago, but didn't think they were as good when i smoked
them then. Haven't seen them since. But haven't been looking, i smoke good old
DRUM halfzware shag(dark hand rolling tobacco). Call the 8 on the bottom of
the B&H and ask for product availability.

Then we need a pack of(yuck) Benson & Hedges 100s Ultra Mild, in the silver
package. Get a lighter, this stash is best suited for in the field when you
are trying to keep any information secret, like the number for your favorite
transsexual escort. If you don't have the lighter, get matches. Or, say they
are a pack of smokes you found, or some friends.

If you are going to open the packs up, always save the plastic wrapped on the
bottom portion of the deck.(deck=slang term for pack of smokes) You can put
cards in them(ID), use it as a money clip, or if you need a baggie, you have
one. A trippy thing to do is peel off the red stripe that says duty paid or
whatever, and put it back on the smokes the way it was. People are like whoah
what... hehe.

So smoke the 100s if you do smoke. I recomend peeling down the tube some paper
to rip it open, do this at the seam and you should be able to rip it all the
way down. Get some papes(zig zags, i recomend blues) and roll the stuff up by
hand, it is rough, if you do it(filterless) for a length of time, you will
have BAD smokers cough. You will get tobacco in your mouth and draw in the
pieces of shit, but its all good. They just stick to the back of your throat.

Dont smoke all the special kings, we need some to make this operation look
legit.

Here is how to make your stash.

Rip the foil out of the 100s pack. Rip off the piece inside the pack, where
the flip top meets the seal, if you dont understand, keep reading and you will
get it.

As you have probably guessed, the smaller special kings pack fits into the
100s pack. You can either glue the special king pack in place in the 100s
pack, or, slip the plastic off the 100s ultra mild, and take a razor blade to
the bottom flap. Dont fuck it up. Make sure your razor is sharp.

So you can either get access to your stash by taking off the plasic, using the
bottom flap opening that you just made, or by sliding out the special kings
pack out the top.

Your stash is about almost half an inch deep and wide by 2.5 inches long.

If you have not figured it out by now, you have to remove the flip top on the
slims, the special kings.

Keep the plastic on the Special Kings as you insert it in the top of the the
100s pack, makes a tighter seal. Align it just right, and it looks totally
normal, unless you are looking real close, and notice the extra cardboard. It
might go unnoticed Benson and Hedges are fancy smokes, the fact that the inner
pack is gold and outer is silver will just seem like some fanciness, as will
this extra cardboard.

Sometimes cops will break smokes open looking for weed, but they prolly won't
notice the cigarette isn;t as long as the pack.

You can keep alot of strips of papers with phone numbers in them using this
method. One thing i do everytime i open a pack of smokes, when you take that
piece of paper, the seal, tuck it between the back of the smokes foil and
cardboard. Just in case you have to write something down.

A stash for a single piece of paper like this, if you have a pager, is in the
battery compartment behind the battery.

This concludes stashie.txt

Pink Hat Hackers
by deadfed [aka phlux]

Some of us hackers/phreakers may fantasize about having a female compadre
to work with. Some of you hardcore types may even say the hackers who
develop a relationship with a girl who is not a hacker are "sell outs".

Some people think female hackers do not exist, and this is completely
untrue. According to the US Commerce Department, female "hackers" make up
28.5% of computer programmers.(2000) They may be called "chixor" or some
variant, which should be a compliment, but this word may be misused.

Sociologists have said women are less likely to be black hats than the
average male. RosieX, editor of the Australian feminist technology magazine
GeekGirl, said cybervandalism was a “masturbatory” activity she’d prefer to
leave to the boys.

I came up with the term "Pink Hats" for this article. While some girls may
not like it, as not all girls like pink, or being associated with it).
Therefore, this term is kind of sterotypical, but implies a special status.
I think it is abit better then "chixor" which is more slang.

Some such hackers may conceal their gender, I asked one girl why:
"its not obvious why I conceal my gender?"

"its the same reason why pirates dont like women on the ship - 'bad omen'..."

"put it this way.. 4 years went by, and I had been on this one server without
having to say I was a guy/girl whatever, they simply assumed I was a guy.
One friend I had on there knew better, and one day, it slipped that I was
indeed, penisless.. about 30 windows opened.. "

"just cause I have tits, doesnt mean they are my only use. Push it, and Ill
g-line you."

"thats kinda the message I had to put across"

This hacker, who remains anonymous, did not appreciate the term "pink hat".
Another anonymous female hacker had this to say:

"No i usally do not conceal my gender most find it hot that a woman knows
what she talks about"

"Yeah I usally get a bit of push back but im not a social type I do not
flaunt my work but if people ask I do not lie. Most do not believe when I
tell them anyways and I do not usally feel the need to prove myself"

"A woman can do anything a man can don't ever doubt that we may be few and
far between but remember woman are great multi taskers and we never forget
;)"

This hacker is a 2nd year Communications Technology student and has a master
in Computer Sciences.

Pinguino has this to say:
"honestly i dont think female hackers are treated unfairly.
 if anything, they get more attention simply because they're girls and there's
 not very many of them, which is a pretty lame reason for the extra attention."
And..
"I love the social aspect of hanging out with friends I've gotten to know
 online over the years. Going to Defcon is always a bit like a family reunion.
 If I spent the years hiding who I was, I'd be missing out on so many great
 experiences and irreplaceable memories."

Notable Pink Hats include:
Ada Byron(Ada Lovelace), world's first programmer.

Grace Murray Hopper, the first "debugger".. she found a moth in a relay.
Developed the earliest compiler.

EvilGrrl and Brazen of the notorious GhettoHackers. The crew won the
DefCon CTF(Capture the Flag) 3 years running.

Gigabyte, a belgian virus writer who coded the first real C# virus.

Raven Alder, first woman to deliver a technical presentation at DefCon.

Elonka Dunin, game devloper, public speaker, writer, and cryptographer.
Led the team that cracked the Cyrillic Projector cipher. Author of 
"The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms"

Anna Moore(alias Starla Pureheart) First female hacker to win the ethical
hacking contest at DefCon.(leet haxor)

Anita Borg, won 1995 Pioneer Award, Electronic Frontier Foundation(and other
awards) Developed the "Systers list"(www.systers.org). May or may not be a

Walk with me talk with me
by phlux of Suicide Hackers


..intro...
Do you know what a throw up is? Tossing up? Hows about "flashing the sign?"
Street gangs use hand signals to communicate with their own set, or faction.
It may also be known as a walk.

I only bang keyboards, but I know enough about "stacking" to present to you
this article on a method of secure communication.(note: some of the more 
specific gang related knowledge may be inaccurate, or out of date)

What follows is a fair bit of actual gang knowledge.(you should know what you
are dealing with before just making your own sign language, which is what this
file is about). Some gangs have actual books of knowledge, filled with the creed
and shit like this, which are studied and may be read from during meetings.

Gangs can have complete conversations without saying a word, using advanced body
and hand signals. Such signs are often used for privacy purposes.

..caution!...
First of all, a word of caution. This applies especially if you live in cities
such as chi town(Chicago), NYC, LA, etc. Be careful what you do with your hands,
especially around people who look like gang types. You may inadvertantly catch
a potential gang members attention, or worse --flash a rival gang sign.
This could be bad. It could just result in a "G check", where the gang member or
members approach you and ask you to "rep yo set", which means they are inquiring
as to what gang you represent, what your name is, your rank, and your OG.

Gang signs ARE used to identify to rivals(as well as their own members).
This is known as claiming, or representing.

..h/p...
However, a gang stack may appeal to a group of phreakers who regularly go out in
the field to do such things as trashing. Having your own stack has advantages
for a CTF(Capture the Flag) / wargaming crew. If the development of the stack
is made securely, you would be able to communicate at a reasonable distance,
and without worrying about about someone on the network sniffing your comms.

Your own stack will have other uses too. One of these uses may be, say if you
and a buddy find yourselves in a jail cell. You may be monitored, and you should
know that you should never talk about anything that can incriminate you with
someone who you think is a fellow inmate. He/She may be 5-0 planted there
specifically to narc.

One idea I had is to stack with a data glove.

..know what to avoid...
There are certain handsigns you should avoid just to be safe, no matter where
you live. The first two are the CK and BK hand signs, or, Crip Killer and Blood
killer. Look them up on the internet and make yourself familiar with them. This
should be easy, the CK hand sign kinda looks like the letters C and K as does
the BK hand sign which is much the same.

Also, never say crab, slob, or in Canada "goof". Crab is derogatory for crip
used by rivals, because they have been known to war with other crip sets. Slob
may be just a variation of crab for the same reason. Slob is derogatory for a
blood. Goof is very very bad Canadian prison slang.  It can mean anything from
pedo, homo, or anything really dispicable/bad. Never say goof if you are in
Canada, just to be safe if you happen to be around someone who has done time.
Saying one of these words can have severe consequences.

Avoid throwing up the horns \m/ This hand sign is also a common handsign used
amongst the Latin Kings, also meaning I Love You in ASL(American SIgn Language).
It is also used by satanists and heavy metal enthusiasts. To the Latin Kings, I
believe it is supposed to represent a 3 pointed crown. It may also be a blood
killer handsign.

To see a very good Latin King stack, search youtube for: Latin Kings yonkers
stackin crowns Or see the links after the outro.

That guy can stack. (probably my most favorite ever, the way he does it shows
alot of respect, given the nature, all the crowns with different points, and
how it relates to "Kings") Not to mention the speed at which he does it near
the end.

Note the star he makes at the beginning with both hands. 5 and 6 pointed stars
should be avoided, especially in Chicago.

The 5 pointed star is a symbol of the peoples alliance, which I believe runs
strongest in Chicago, where it was started in the illinois penal system.

The 6 pointed star, or star of David is a symbol of the folks alliance, as is
the pitch fork. The pitchfork may represent the struggles to overcome
oppression, to Gangster Disciples, or other folks who use it.

The stars may be gang knowledge applicable only to Chicago. Each point of the
star has a different meaning, or "value". To Latin Kings the five point star
represents a colony of five islands in the Caribbean which are:

>Puerto Rico
>Cuba
>Dominican Republic
>Haiti
>Jamaica

Search for the Gangster Disciples handsign, that is the pitch fork. Pointing
that hand sign downwards should especially be avoided, as this shows disrespect,
or worse. (I believe there is a scene on Dangerous Minds where Michelle Pfeiffer
flashes some gang members their own sign, and then turns it upside down. The
gang members react)

SO backwards or upside letters and symbols show disrespect, and may be used to
initialize a threat. 

In gang graffiti, a rival gangs name may be spelled out backwards to show
disrespect, and diss the gang mentioned. Letters representing a rival gang, for
instance b for bloods or c for crip, may be be crossed out for the same reason.
It may be replaced with with the letter of the graffers gang, so crip may turn
into Brip. Crips/Bloods may even refuse to pronounce/write the letters C, B, or
P (they may just "mark out" the opposing letters in writing. Also P for Bloods,
as the Bloods were founded on Piru street. Piru may refer to a Blood, or, more
specifically it may refer to a set such as Piru x Bloods, or a member of such a
set.) Crossing out a handsign such as the C for crip, with the other hand by
making it a slash, like a cent sign, is one way of showing disrespect. Another
way is to make a handsign and break it over the knee, raising the knee slightly.

On a related interesting note, look at the word Piru .. read it backwards, but
turn the U sideways making it a C. blood upside down is PLOOP. If you ever see
graffiti with a down arrow, chances are its a gang indicating you are on their
turf. However, some elaborate graffiti art makes use of arrows.

You may have seen the blood hand sign somewhere. The fingers of both hands
actually SPELLS b-l-o-o-d.(there is a crip hand sign which has a spelling of
the letters too, using both hands)

Gang members may "false flag" a handsign to a rival gang member. Say a crip
sees someone he thinks is a blood. He may just throw up GD, to see if the
potential blood in question is indeed a blood, by waiting for him to throw up
his own sign. After this he may throw up his real handsign, maybe a C for a
crip.

Gang colors are not an indicator of a particular gang. Bloods may be seen
wearing blue jeans, or non red flags/bandanas. Gang members may disguise in non
gang or rival gang colors. Some sets just fly other colors, as in the case of
Lime Street Pirus(who are Bloods). Guess what their color is.

Not all gangs of the same name use the same handsign. Bloods and Crips have no
centralized leadership, so every set, faction, or trey(tray) is different. Some
sets are not satellite sets, and may be known as a clone set. This is a gang who
uses a name, but they have no ties, to say, back to LA, or Chicago. Of another
interesting note, Bloods/Crips dont last in Chi town and get run out, or worse.

Gangs often use a characters position in the alphabit to respresent that
character. For example, 1 4 18 means A D R which ultimately stands for Amor De
Rey, which is a Latin King saying.(I believe it means "King Love").

If you ever see 187 somewhere, like on a wall, it means murder. It is a numeric
code in use by the po's. Section 187 of the California Penal Code is for the
crime of murder. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-8-7

..walk the walk...
You may be thinking, with all the gangs out there, what can you safely stack?
Nothing if you are around strangers. But in the dead of night, or the shelter of
a hacker convention, you can stack pretty safely. You don't have to avoid every
sign in use by other gangs, that would leave none for you to communicate with!

Avoid the ones mentioned and avoid flashing in public unless you have too.

When making your stack, the most secure way is to do it on paper, hell even use
spy paper that is destroyed when it comes into contact with water. Get a sign
language dictionary if you cant think of new ways to contort your fingers and
come up with motions. Just don't copy from the dictionary. Copy the pages with
your hand signs and mail them out securely to friends. If you have to send them
digitaly, use strong encryption.

Familiarize yourself with other gangs signs, Bloods, MS13, etc.. again, check
out the links at the end of this article. Check out their graffiti, for symbols
they may use.

The bigger your stack dictates how useful it will be for communicating. Keep in
mind you have to memorize all of this. Try using mnemonics. (becareful not to
comprimise the security though!)

Think of symbols or letters you can make with your hands. Dont forget the
motions. You can even have a behind-the-back-stack. One handsign that should
come to mind, especially if you are a phreak, is the sign for phone, which I
believe also means "hang loose". Thumb and pinky extended, middle 3 fingers
closed(clenched into a partial fist).

You may be lucky like me and be able to spell out your area code with your
fingers. For me it is as follows: four fingers on the right hand extended, thumb
folded. Four. On the left hand the thumb tip touches the pointer tip. Zero.
Remaining fingers on left hand extended. Three. 403

You can point hands downwards, and then cross your arms and reverse the digits
to have the 403 sign at your shoulders. Think gangsta like this if you want lol.

You may want to change up your stack at certain times. Some signs may not need
changing if they do not comprimise security.

Here is some Tactical Hand Signals from handsig.txt where i compiled these in
2/21/2003:

I got these from the manual for Daryl F Gates' Police Quest SWAT simulator game.
(waste of money)

You might find these useful for field phreaking or 'urban exploration'.

-Clenched Fist = HOLD


-Flat Hand(horizontal) = TAKE COVER


-Fist with arm at right angle = HURRY


-Flat hand with all fingers spread = SUSPECT


-Snapping fingers(motion) = ATTENTION


-Index finger pointing = LOOK


-Thumb up = CLEAR


-Flat hand, vertical = STOP


-Flat hand, horizontal at neck(motion) = KILL


-Index finger against lips = STFU


..outro...

Is it really necessary to stack? No, but it can be fun, and it may bring you and
your hacker buddies closer together. I was wondering if i could take a
linguistical approach to the signs, but all you really need to do is: Pick up a
Pocket Dictionary on Signing, use it as a reference. And watch stackin videos on
youtube, for inspiration.

Try and get creative and make your own signs. Here is some i thought of:

W
x  ASCII art for the female form, signs can be flashed in succession. I stole
Y   this from a beavis and butthead comic. Beavis: "Drawing naked chicks is as
     easy as W x Y!"

x_X or o_0  mean mugging, or confusion. with x's may also symbolize death.
       o 0  hand sign is made by touching thumb and pointer together, and
            bending and folding the middle finger to touch the joint on the
            pointer.
 ...
/___\ Two utility knife razor blades touching eachother at the sharp bladed end.
\.../ This symbol and handsign is used to represent being on the "cutting edge".
      To make the hand sign, make the universal handsign for a phone handset on
      both hands. Touch the pinkys and thumbs together. This makes a diamond-
      like shape, and the knuckles are the notches in the razor blades.

C(_) Coffee mug, may resemble GD hand sign. Read how to do the o_0 sign and just
     open the thumb and pointer to make the cup.

<3  The heart, has gang connotations, but can be used safely. I saw this in O
    magazine(don't ask) Hold your fingers one one hand together, no gaps between
    them, thumb remains free. This could be a cane(vice lords use canes). Do
    this with both hands and bring them together to make a heart, finger tips
    and thumb tips  touching. Now figure out how to make a heart with your hands
    and a diamond at the same time, for another heart hand sign.

Another fun idea is to have a call, a noise you make, as if you were an animal
or something. Bloods roll their tongues and say BLLLAAATTT or BRRRAATTT to mimic
an automatic gun like an UZI. Crips have a similar call too. These calls are
used to intimidate.

Sis -- "Phlux was my brother and all though we were not as close as we
should have been I have great respect for the life he lived. He may have had
a few demons that took over but from what I saw he thoroughly enjoyed life.
I remember him back in the days before "Phlux" and he rigged up an alarm
system for his bedroom door, when he always tried to get a few laughs by
making computers saying "Windows is shitting down" when you turned them off
and when he was so excited to get anything electronic. Even though over the
years we grew apart when my son was born Phlux took a great liking to my new
baby. He and my mom had plans of getting a shirt made that read "Future
Hacker". So even though he is gone his memories and aspirations will live on
and damn it I will find a shirt that says that for my son to wear so he can
remember his uncle.
Thanks for the interesting insight to the life that was separate from his
families. I think it is awesome that he had other family that loved and
respected him!
Rest in Peace Phlux (Clint)
Your Sis"

Amanda & Hailey -- "Tribute to Clint... Clint was an awesome cousin and a
great friend. He at some points in time had big hair, but always a bigger
heart. We could sit and chit chat about nothing and at the same time
everything. He would always get a good chuckle out of my lack of computer
skills, he was the one I always called on for help when I was ready to chuck
it out the window. If it wasn’t for Clint my printer still wouldn’t be hooked
up! He sure wasn’t afraid to dream big, and he was always coming up with new
ideas on a number of topics. I will never forget his smile. RIP Clint. We
love you and will always miss you."

Hello:

I am Clint's step-aunt, sister to his stepdad Ron. I understand that your
on-line magazine is paying a special tribute to Clint in your next edition
and I would like to say a few words. Clint was a young boy when he arrived
into our family with his older brother and younger sister. He had
beautiful red hair, a twinkle in his eyes and the happiest smile you could
imagine. He appeared very confidant in himself and it became apparent
fairly quickly that of the three of them he was the jokester, the one who
was going to lightheartedly enjoy life complete with kid pranks and harmless
mischief. He was always a delight when he visited and he and all the kids
used to love to wrestle, run around and laugh. He grew into a handsome
young man that became troubled by a terrible illness. It is only since his
death that I/we have become aware of his involvement with the hacker club
and the extent of his gift with using the computer. It is very comforting
to know that Clint had a group of friends that cared about him and that his
last years and months were spent in good company doing what brought him
enjoyment in life. I would like to thank everybody in the hacker club for
being there for Clint - he was a great kid, a wonderful young man and he
will be very much missed.

Thank-you,

Rosemarie Hoefsloot

Hello, My name is Randy Haller, I am Clint's Uncle.
One of my fondest memories of Clint was last Christmas when we exchanged
gifts. Both presents were a 5 pack of Coors Light. (One can mysteriously
missing from each six pack). We laughed like little girls for quite awhile,
then all night long whenever we looked at each other, we would start to
chuckle again. I like to think Clint and I were on the same page.
I will miss him...

To the Hacker Community;

On behalf of Clint, myself, Ron, Josh, Alisha and all our family, I wish to
thank all the Hackers for their sympathy and compassion.

As a Mother, it gives me great comfort to know that my son was part of such
a kind and caring community.

I send my Shouts to: theclone, and to everyone who contributed to making such
a touching and kind, nettwerked radio dedication.

Also thanks, for giving us all the opportunity to share stories, memories and
send our farewell tributes to K-1ine #51. I think this is the best and
greatest tribute we could have.

Also, Shouts to warweed, for meeting with me and Ron and for being so very
supportive and helpful.

Being connected to the Hacker community brings me some comfort, for I know,
you all were such an important part of my son’s life.

It is my hope; you will continue to share stories, memories; and to never
forget...

I wish I knew you all better, and under better circumstances, but thank you
all!

Love from Phlux’s Mom,
Carol

The Story of the White Roses

When my Mom passed away, 23 years ago, she planned, at her service to have
white rose buds. One white rose bud for each member of her family.

When my Dad passed away 11 years ago, I took 2 white rose buds to his grave.
1 white rose bud for my Mom and 1 white rose bud for my Dad.

When my son, Clint passed away, I spent the longest time, choosing 6 perfect,
white rose buds. 1 was for Ron, 1 was for me, 1 was for Josh, 1 was for Clint,
1 was for Alisha and 1 was for everyone else.

As the hours turned into days, I sat and stared, at the white rose buds, and
cried and grieved, for my son, Clint. One day, I realized; that only 1 rose
bud had opened and bloomed. The other 5 flowers were still buds. A sense of
comfort flooded into my heart, for I knew, it was Clint’s rose bud, the only
1 that had flourished. Clint is the one who is now and always, forever at
peace. No more sorrow or pain, only joy.

One day, someone I love, will have to choose a white rose bud for me. It will
only be then, that I will truly bloom.  

Until we are together again,
Carol

Clint was a good hearted young man who was always pleasant to be around and
who had a good sense of humour. We'll never forget when he was a little red
headed boy, who always had a smirk on his face and was always up to
something. The world will be a lesser place without him. And we miss him. 
Love from his cousins Rob, Tracy, Mike, Shandell, and Ashley Hoefsloot.

Dear Clint,

I miss you so much! It is so very hard for me to accept that you are gone
from my life. I keep trying to remember that you are only gone from this
earth and not gone from my life. You are, and always will be, a part of me,
of who I am, and who I will be; as I was a part of you, and who you were. I
will never stop loving you…and I quote: "I see you, I feel you; that is, how,
I know you will go on".

I am so very sorry, you got sick. I am sorry you had pain and sorrow that
became more than you could bear. I know that you tried so hard to overcome
the torture that you lived with and became a part of your life. I understand;
that you did what you had to do. I wish I could have helped you, but you were
so strong, you did everything you could do, to not burden me and to try to
protect me, from sadness and pain. You worried more about me, than about
you. That’s the kind of person you were...

I am so proud of you and of who you were. You were everything a Mother would
hope her child would be. You were always so kind and thoughtful. You really
did care about other peoples needs, before your own. You were always so
giving. I really don’t think you ever met anyone who you didn’t like or who
didn’t like you. I think you had to be the most grateful and appreciative
person, I ever knew. You were always so thankful, even for the most,
simplest things. Even as a baby, you were so smart. Your intelligence grew,
as you did. You never ceased to amaze me. Whatever you wanted to do, you did
so well, with such excellence and expertise. You were so unique, and proud to
be that way. It is what made you, who you were, so exceptional, so Clint. I
am proud of how spiritual you were. I never doubted your values or morals.
You had such intense, deep feelings, and wisdom. You had a great sense of
humor and I am so glad you laughed so often. You were funny, witty and
sometimes mischievous. Your smile, sometimes more of a grin, always came with
the twinkle and gleam in your eyes, and always, as if you had a deep thought
to go along with it. Clint, I could say so much about you, there are so very
many stories I could tell, and happy memories I could share...

Most of all, Clint, I am so proud of your strength and courage! I pray; that
in time, I will gain just a part of the courage and strength you had. Watch
over me; give me, guidance, for I need you now, more than you’ll ever know.

No farewell words were spoken,
No time to say Goodbye.
You were gone before I knew it,
And only God knows why.
Your memory is my keepsake,
With which I’ll never part,
God has you in his keeping,
I have you in my heart.

I promise you; you may be gone, but you will never be forgotten...

Love always, Mom

Hi,

I’m Ron, Clint’s Step Dad.

I have raised Clint since he was about 6 years old and enjoyed all the time
we spent together. I have many good stories I could tell about Clint, but I
will always remember this one.

We took Clint (and his brother & sister) to Las Vegas & Disneyland a couple
of times. On one trip through Las Vegas, Clint got my brother Allan in a bit
of trouble at a Casino.

There was an Arcade only a few feet away from the slot machines in the
Casino. Of course anyone under 21 years old isn’t allowed to gamble, so some
Casinos put Arcades in them for kids to throw their money away on.

Well, Clint was very careful on what he spent money on in those days, so he
had a good idea. He would hand his quarters to my brother Allan a few feet
away to put in the slot machine for him. Clint thought this was a much better
deal than the arcade machines.

Clint was making good money on the slot machines that Allan was playing for
him, and was happy he wasn’t wasting his money in the arcade. But, as Clint
was watching his 25 cent investment grow, Casino Security came over to Allan
and told him they were going to throw him out if he gambled any more for
Clint. So, that ended Clint's first gambling spree in Vegas.

I was hoping one day to take him back to Las Vegas so that he could play
those same slot machine once again. I will play those same slot machines for
Clint myself one day, and every time they spit out a quarter, I will think
of him.

Clint’s life was cut short at 24 years, but he lived a lot in those years. I
will miss him.

--Ron

warweed -- "Honestly, over the past 2 months I have been trying to come up
with words to describe the impact that clint has had on my life over the
years and the impact on all of us. I still can not find those words today
other than to describe a virtual brotherhood. One thing I always found with a
cyber-community... you don't always have to meet them to feel like you're
attached. Me personally, I can go into parts of my life and talk about
different things online and with friends that I would not feel comfortable
saying in public. Clint was pretty much a like a brother if not a really good
friend. I met him a few times in real life but not as many as some and I was
always greeted by a great smile. He was always a positive impact on my life
and always a great friend to talk to. It always seemed that no matter the
time of day he was always there to talk to no matter what the problem was.
Now that Clint has left us I feel a little bit empty inside as I think it is
with a few of us in this community. I have found I am so greatful for the
time I was able to spend talking with Clint and even more greatful for the
positive role I feel that the members of Hack Canada and Nettwerked have
played on a lot of us and the support it has provided.. I have found that
they, like many have described, are like a second family that even though you
may fight, have strong disagreements, or even hate each other, they were
always there for you if you truly needed it and this was never more evident
when we held our own personal meeting in Clint's memory. We were pleasantly
welcomed from so many friends. Me and Clint, like I mentioned previously, had
not seen each other often in real life, but when we did we had a great time.
More recently, me and my ex-wife passed through calgary with our son and
Clint held him :) He held my son in his arms much like he held his nephew in
so many photo's i have seen... with a giant smile on his face. It always
seemed that Clint was such a giving type. That if he only had a few dollars to
his name and someone else needed it more then him, I think he would give it to
them. Every time I saw Clint he was like this. He gave me a hat with the
symbol for motorola when me and the ex were out there, and on the back it had
the ATT wireless and rogers logo's. lol. I wore that hat like every day when I
got it. I truly apologize if it seems like I'm rambling but there are so many
great stories i want to share, and even more so, so many happy feelings and
good times I wish to share with all of you. I find myself lacking in the words
to describe them and I'm not certain if I will ever be able to put into words
to describe them... but I take a lot of comfort in knowing that not only
myself but the entire community and friends and family will always have the
support for one another during our times of need. For the longest time...
well, not a long long time but long enough ... it always seemed to me that
Clint was there just because he liked the scene.. 'til i started reading some
of his work ... it blew me away. Clint is on one of the top of my lists with
a few others when it came down to a lot of telecommunications information. It
was so surprising just holding a conversation with him or reading over some of
his work how incredibly brilliant he was. Anyways, I still can not come up
with a lot of the things I want to describe. All I can say is I'm so very
greatful for the support carol and ron (Clint's parents) have given me and the
support of the hackcanada scene especially "carnage" and "theclone". Also,
when MsO gave me a hug outside of the metro when we met really meant a lot to
me. I will always remember the last moment I shared with Clint and I will
always hold it dear to me. I truly know that Clint is in a better place and I
know he watches down over us each and every day. I want all the friends and
family and all the people of the community to know that if you ever just want
to talk or need someone to talk to, I am there for you and we are there for
you. And lastly, Clint, I don't know if you can read this but we love you man.
There is nothing I can use to descirbe the friendship I felt we all had with
you and I take so much comfort in knowing you spent some of your last time
with me. I wish there was somthing I could have done ... anyways, rest in
peace, my friend, for some day I will see you again :) And I really do think
you were right... "Just because you giving up does not mean your weak, it
just means your strong enough to walk away". -James G. Fowler,

Jeff Doyle -- "Tribute to Phlux (Clint Haller)
As I have had the greatest opportunity to be one of Clint's friends, I was
deeply sadden to hear the news of his passing.
I am a good friend of Clint and his mom. I will always cherish the memories
I have of Clint. One which I will always remember as I have it in my own
"Personal Memorabilia" is a birthday card that he made for me in 1994 (that
would be when he was just 11 years old). On the front cover it says "Happy
Birthday Jeff" colored in brilliant colors. On the inside, he put a hockey
card of Al Macinnis of the Flames during the 1990 All Star Game along with a
poem that he wrote for me "Roses are red, violets are green, please think of
me when ever you clean". He put some thought into it as the "Roses are red"
part was colored in red, the "violets are green" part was colored in green,
the "please think of me" part was colored in purple and the "when ever you
clean" part was colored in orange. I will always have this card in my
possession to remind me of the good times with Clint.
Rest in peace Clint (Phlux)"

alan -- "Phlux would come along with me for coffee whenever I was able to
reach him passing through Calgary. The times I remember best were when he was
chatting on #hackcanada with my then (2005) new Mac iBook G4 hooked up to a
Motorola GSM/GPRS phone (GPRS service on Rogers and Fido ran free for nearly
2 years, alas no more ;-( ) while riding in my car. It sure beat looking
for open network hot spots!"

"If I knew it would be the last time
I would be there to share your day,
I would have said how much I love you
In each and every way." -Unknown
 
Clint is part of my fondest memories, some of my most deeply felt emotions,
and has been there during some of my most rewarding experiences. Clint is a
special person and to many people he shared their memories, their emotions,
their laughter, and their secrets.
 
When I found out about the loss of Clint, it felt as though someone had
turned off the lights in the auditorium to my life. I felt as if a part of
my heart had left along with him, hopeful expectations dimmed, and I felt
smaller, like a weight had been placed upon me. 
 
On February 2 of 2008, Clint's body was no longer living, but his spirit
refused to die. It lives in the hearts and souls and stories and laughter of
his family and friends . It lives in the good deeds he performed. It lives
in the tributes and stories and photos shared by all. And it will always
live and expand in the heart and soul of myself.
 
Clint was a good friend and had a special significance in my life. As a
friend he evoked a sense of love, pride, frustration and joy. His death made
me realize he was so much more then a friend and the memories and spirit he
inspired during his short life are more then enough to go beyond his
passing. 
 
Today is my chance to say thank you for the way you brightened my life, even
though you were only granted but a small portion yours. I am deeply saddened
that you were taken from this world so young but must learn to be grateful
that you came along and were a part of my life at all. Only now that you are
gone can I truly appreciate what I had, I wish for you to know that life
without you is difficult. 
 
Your greatest gift was your kindness, it was a gift and you used it well.
You cared so much about the people around you and how they felt. You went
out of your way to make me smile on a bad day. I think some days you started
arguments with me just so you could cheer me up afterwards. I will never
forget the passion you expressed when we talked, and the love you had for me
and my family. It has been a hard goodbye, but I will continue to let your
spirit and the fond memories live and be a part of me. And Clint, for all
the times you have said it to me, I love you too.

lucky225 -- "As I sit here writing my thoughts about a person who came into
my life and filled it with much needed joy and laughter, I regret that even
after his death I am a little to late. Clint, AKA Phlux, was a dear friend
of mine who always had a way of making you laugh no matter what was going on
in your personal life, and he was also always willing to lend an ear when no
one else seemed to care.
  Phlux said a lot of off-the-wall quirky things while he was still with us,
though he has been deemed to have a mental illness, I sincerely think most of
the things he said was part of his character. The things that came out of his
mouth were some of the most creative things I have ever heard, and I believe
he was very intelligent. I regret that in the days before his passing we had
grown apart a bit. We still emailed each other however a lot of the things he
had to say were not top priority for me at the time and I failed to pay much
attention to it. He always wanted me to call him or page him with tele-
conference information. I feel totally horrible now for not making those
calls. To top it off, he passed away on the 2nd anniversary of my marriage.
  The last few emails I received him, ironically, were to make some diss-raps
about The Clone(half-jokingly). And the very last email was on January 2nd,
2008 where he sent me a link to a payphone hoodie he was thinking about
buying. http://www.lounge37.com/images.php?type=store&image_id=6055 is the
link if anyone's interested.
  He was good friends with an old high school friend of mine as well, Pooly.
Pooly, like Phlux, I regret I have lost much contact with, I will try to get
in touch before the deadline for K-line 51 so he can write his 2 cents. They
had a pact that if they lived to be like 80 or so they were going to blow up
the San Francisco bridge and cause all kinds of havoc before they kicked the
bucket together.  
  Phlux was one of the first people I met in the scene, and one of the only
ones who stood by me no matter what happened. My heart goes out to him, I
hope he has found a better place at the great phone booth in the sky, he will
be deeply missed."

Carnage -- "Clint was my friend. He was the most honest person I have ever
known. While on occasion he could be a little over dramatic, what I will
always remember is his infectiously positive attitude. When I think of him
now I feel sad, but only for a moment. Then I smile again as the memories
flood back fresh. It's like an old memory of a great day that is gone but
will always remind you of how good you felt when it was happening... it
bleeds over and leaves you feeling loss and comfort at the same time. I miss
my friend. I miss his cheerful greetings and his amusing stories. I miss his
wildly original ideas, his crazy obsessions, and his constant pursuit of new
and creative projects. I miss his lust for life. But most of all, I miss
being able to talk to him about anything and never feeling judged or margin-
alized. I miss my friend. But when I find myself thinking about him, it's not
when I'm sad. It's when I'm euphoric. R.I.P my brother. I will never forget."

CYB0RG/ASM -- "My memories of phlux... the thing about phlux, for me, is that
phlux and I have so much in common... so insanely much, that I wonder if we
weren't poorly xeroxed copies of one another. When I first met him in
cyberspace (1998/99) he was about 14 or 15 and he *loved* nokia phones. He
gave me his collection of "sexy girls with payphones" pictures (some showing
boobies!) Heh. You're so jealous. Maybe I'll release it someday ;) He was
always trying to learn to code, but never had too much success. We'd stay up
all night and chat on IRC. He liked phones and phreaking, computers and
technology, cyberpunk, VR, skateboarding, graffiti, fashion, smoking tobacco
and da 'erb, and any combination of the above. Oh, and he had this amazing
natural orange frizzy afro. Like, I'm talking AFRO! Carrot top jokes abound!
And I guess that's kinda fitting because as you can see by his articles, he
was kind of the jokester of the Canadian phreaking scene. He gave me his
favorite "Magic" card, even though (or in spite of the fact) I always told
him that game was gay. I still have that card btw, phlux. "Dark Ritual", and
you were right, it is bad-ass. =) He got along well with everyone who met
him. He always shared whatever he had. Information. Codes. He'd give you his
last smoke or his last toke. He really looked up to the HC people, and as far
as I'm concerned, he's always been a member of the very core HC family. He's
been with us almost from the beginning, now here we are at the end of K-1ine.
I'm sad that he won't get to share in all that we have left to explore. But
who knows? Maybe he's off exploring a whole new realm. And ultimately, as the
pain of losing phlux integrates, I personally think he went out with mad
style. *Thirty-two* published articles in K-1ine, Hack Canada, and elsewhere!
One pending publication in 2600 magazine that I didn't even know about! 'Leet.
Who else gets the last issue ever of the most bitching Canadian e-zine ever as
their obit? Fucking NOBODY. That's who. He left a hell of an impact on the
Canadian phreaking scene. All these things, along with a host of other (kinda
personal) details... Seriously. Epic. Phlux. A star that burned so quickly, so
brightly, and now shall suffer nevermore. I will forever be your friend. You
will always be with me. *hug^infinity^2*"

Clone's words...


I first met Phlux online around September of 1999 on irc.2600.net #2600ca,
approximately 3 months after I joined Hack Canada - and right after I
attended the Def Con Conference for the very first time. 

Phlux must have been around 15 years old at the time. I remember staying up
late, chatting about every aspect of telephones, and calling random
payphones in the United States with him to harass anyone who would bother
answering. Hitting up voice conferences and talking about our latest
‘sploits and sharing ideas for new projects and K-1ine articles was a
regular occurrence for us (hell, the other day CYB0RG/ASM told me that Phlux
had submitted over 30 articles to K-1ine ‘zine which got published. I never
realized it was that many!).

After a short time, I think around a year, Phlux decided he would come up to
Edmonton and meet up with the entire Hack Canada crew + friends… instantly
he was accepted and respected by all. I think mostly because of his
hardcore, DIY attitude, and the fact he knew his computer/telecom stuff was
a plus. It was pretty fuckin’ awesome to finally meet someone who was around
my age and also into telecommunications. Especially the hardware / real life
side of phone phreaking (field phreaking), since I was mainly into the
remote aspect of it.

One time around 2002, when he was staying with my brother and me at our
crappy two bedroom apartment in Castledowns (North Edmonton), Phlux got this
crazy idea about hacking into a Disney Resort in Florida’s hotel PBX- and
playing pranks on people in various rooms. He had learned about how
exploitable Disney hotel PBX’s were from the SoCal conferences he regularly
attended back then. So we called up, were able to break into the PBX and
pretend to be within a specific room (since the room phones and the main
hotel switchboard showed our calls as internal)… and we’d order food and
drinks to other people’s suites… call up one suite, acting as another one
and hitting on or just being plain rude to the other person on the other end
of the phone.

The last few years Phlux and I grew apart. And I regret that this happened.
I regret that we got into an argument around a week before he passed away. I
regret that we had a stupid fight last summer. If I had a chance, I’d have
worked harder at trying to fix our differences and make things right. I’m
saddened that the last communication I sent to him was an apology for our
fighting, and a request asking him to forgive me and to try and work it out.

It’s been a rough month for me after Phlux’s passing, and I can now take
solace in knowing that he knew he had friends, a caring family, and that he
made an impact on a community that cared very deeply for him. Somewhere,
someplace phreaking the other realm, Phlux -- if you are able to tap into
cyber space, I hope you’re reading this. I hope you know that we haven’t
forgotten about you, man. Because we all love and care about you. And I’ll
personally never forget you and the great times we shared.

This K-1ine is for you.

Your friend in life and in death,
The Clone
