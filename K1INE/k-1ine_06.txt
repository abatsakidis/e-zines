			_-_ FAX Fiasco _-_


Written by: Ethan 
August 8, 2000

			     

"Is there an electrical engineer in the house?" asked Phyllis.

"Does sticking you finger in the electrical socket one too many times
count?  What's the problem?"

"The FAX machine is broken."

Indeed.  Every time a FAX would come in, the blinkin' lights would flash and
the speaker would show: PAPER JAM.  Upon careful examination, it appeared
that the paper feeder mechanism wasn't working.  Whipping out the trusty
set of office tools, I quickly peeled the case off so I could get to the
whirring bits...   

Behind a couple of PCBs lay the feeder mechanism, which consisted of a bar
with a rubber roller attached to a special slip gear.

The slip gear was a two part assembly.  The first part was the main drive
gear driven by the motor.  It was not directly attached to the feeder shaft
and could spin freely if the shaft were stuck.  The second part was a
sleeve with a coil of wire around it that was directly attached to the
shaft via a face plate at the end.  Parallel to this sleeve was a metal
plate with a solenoid behind it.  It looked something like this:


                    Main Gear

                        ---  Sleeve with
                        ---    Coil
                        --- ||||||||||# 

                        --- ||||||||||#
           ============ --- ||||||||||-
                        --- ||||||||||#
       Feeder Bar       --- ||||||||||#
                        --- j
                        --- ===========
                                        |         |
                            |         |
                            -----------

                             Metal Plate
                                                         with Solenoid
                                                         (not pictured)


The coil had a small hook in it at one end which would catch against the
metal plate when the solenoid was off.  This allowed the drive gear to spin
when the motor started without feeding a sheet of paper.  As soon as the
timing were correct, the solenoid was supposed to fire and pull the plate
out of the way to allow the shaft to turn.  The problem was, it wasn't.

My first thought was to test the solenoid.  Being multimeter free, this was
going to be a challenge.  Seeing a transformer at the rear of the unit, I
figured the voltage might be stepped down a bit, so I pulled the 5VDC
power supply off my Personal Jukebox MP3 player[1] and grabbed some
staples.  Removing the solenoid connector from the PCB, I put the staples
in the connector holes and touched the staples to jack on the power supply.

Nothing.

Well, the voltage might be too low, so I needed another plan.  What I
really needed was an LED.  Scrounging around in the parts bin turned up 
nothing, though, so I was starting to run out of options.

Then I remembered Tony had an X-Files key-chain light that I knew had an LED
in it.  So, I grabbed it off his desk and cracked that sucker open.  Now,
this was one of those "squeeze till it lights" key-chains with the batteries
inside, so I left the key-chain as intact as I could; that way I could use
the batteries and the light to test the solenoid.  I put the staples back
in the solenoid connector and touched them to the batteries to copulate the
circuit.

Lo! and Behold! the light was green!  Continuity of the solenoid was good,
so this must mean there was some other problem.

After fiddling around with the thing for a while, doing some trial an error
experiments, it turned out that the screws holding the face-plate to the
feeder bar had worked loose and allowed the sleeve to twist out of position
on the shaft.  This meant that the timing of the solenoid was off, so by
the time solenoid actually fired to pull the plate out of the way, things
had gotten wound up so tight that the metal plate wouldn't budge, thus
causing a simulated paper jam.  Twisting the faceplate back into position
and tightening the screws was all it took.

   2. Disconnect the 3-wired relay.
   3. Disconnect the modular RJ11pigtail connector.
   4. Disconnect the ground strap.
   5. Loosen the slotted nut at the bottom left of the circuit board chassis.
   6. Remove the circuit board chassis by carefully pulling down &
      away from the inside of the lower housing.

Step 3 - Removing the Coin Acceptor

   1. Remove the coin reject chute from the coin acceptor by loosening the
      screw that attaches them together.
   2. Loosen the slotted nut at the top rear of the coin acceptor.
   3. Remove the coin acceptor.

Step 4 - Removing the Coin Box

   1. Insert the lower housing key into the lock on the left side of the
      lower housing & turn it 90º backwards.
   2. Insert the T-Key into the hole in the vault door & turn it ¼ turn to
      the right.
   3. Remove the vault door & the coin box from the vault area.

Step 5 - Securing the Lower Housing to the Mounting Surface

   1. Insert the telephone line wire through the line wire entrance hole.
   2. Secure the payphone to the mounting surface using ¼ - 20
      mounting screws, (try to avoid optional hole.)

Step 6 - Reinstalling the Coin Box

   1. Install the coin box
   2. Make sure lower housing key is in unlock position
   3. Insert the T-Key into the vault door & secure the vault door
      by turning the T-Key ¼ turn to the left.

Step 7 - Reinstalling the Coin Acceptor

   1. Before installing the coin acceptor, make sure the
      trigger switch (part beneath coin acceptor,) is secured.
   2. Guide the tab at the bottom rear of coin acceptor into the
      rear slot of trigger switch.
   3. Position coin acceptor bracket on rear lip of the slotted nut 
      & then tighten nut.
   4. Reinstall coin reject chute making sure it is properly attached to
      the side of coin hopper.

Step 8 - Reinstalling the Circuit Board Chassis

   1. Install the circuit board chassis by guiding the tab at the
      top rear of the chassis into the slot at the top, left side of the
      lower housing. As you position tab, guide the chassiss slotted nut
      onto the mounting stud of the lower left side of the housing & then 
      tighten it.
   
   2. Connect the trigger switch to the 4-pronged socket.
   
   3. Connect the relay to the 3-pronged socket.
   
   4. Connect the RJ11 modular plug to the incoming RJ11 outlet of
      the circuit board.
   
   5. Connect the ground strap to the middle right screw of the terminal
      block.
   
   6. Connect the battery connector. (Note: To prevent battery
      draining, leave the battery unplugged if the telephone line is
      not to be connected shortly after installing the phone.)

Step 9 - Connecting the Telephone Line

   A minimum of 22ma (or 44 VDC) loop current must be provided to the
   phone from the Telephone Companys Central Office. In certain
   situations, due to the distance between the Central Office and the
   phone site, the loop current may not meet the required level of 22ma.
   If the loop current is below 22ma, dial tone may not occur or the
   phone may experience only momentary burst of dial tone. It is
   recommended that the loop current level at the phone be tested at this
   time to ensure that the required loop current level is present.

    1. Connect the tip wire to the terminal block screw across
       from the green pigtail cable.
    
    2. Connect the ring wire to the terminal block screw across
       from the red pigtail cable.
    
    3. Connect an incoming ground wire to the left middle terminal
       block screw to insure safe operation.

   OPTIONAL: If using a line cord with a modular RJ11 plug, simply
   unplug the incoming RJ11 pigtail connector from the surge protector
   & insert the modular RJ11 plug in its place, bypassing the terminal
   block.         

Step 10 - Connecting the Upper & Lower Housings

    1. Carefully rest the upper housing on the ledge of the lower housing.
    
    2. Plug in the 25-pin ribbon cable male plug to the 25-pin female
       socket of the circuit board chassis.
    
    3. Reference the initialization procedure before completely
       securing the upper & lower housing.


Step 11 - Inserting the Instruction Card & Windows

    1. Insert the lower portion of the upper instruction card (the
       smaller card) into the lower portion of the upper faceplate cutout,
       (the smaller cutout.)
    
    2. Insert the top, right corner of the card into the top, right
       corner of the upper faceplate cutout & guide the remaining portion
       of the card into the faceplate from right to left, using a
       flat-head screwdriver.
   
    3. Repeat the previous 2 steps to insert the lower instruction card.
   
    4. Remove the plastic wrap from the plastic windows & then use
       the same method used to insert the instruction cards to insert the
       upper & lower plastic windows in front of the instruction cards.
       Press against any portions of the windows that appear to be bulging
       out to make them flush against the instruction cards.

Quick Programming Reference

       All program entries are done in the program mode, using the keypad.

   Entering the Program Mode

    Step 1 - Push & hold the black program button (located on left side of
             circuit board, towards the top)
    Step 2 - Pick up the handset. When you hear a single beep, release the
             program button.

   Note: One beep is a completed entry. Three beeps is an error. To start
   an entry over, press the # key & wait for three beeps to be heard. All
   program entries can be done in one session in no specific order except
   for the initialization being done first. To set the CTR-201 back to
   the factory pre-settings, re-initialize the phone.

Initializing the CTR-201

   Enter the program mode & type in the following entries.

   Step 1 - 00 HAC NXX XXXX * (Home Area Code & Telephone # of the Payphone)

   Step 2 - 47111 *

                                   Entry

     Example:    

 6000    0035   0010   015     05    0008     *

   The above entry would make Call Type Rate Band 6000 (7-digit calls,
   non-specific) $. 35 the first 15 minutes and $ .10 each additional 5
   minutes.

  Step 1 - Enter the 4-digit Call Type Rate Band, (see list on page 5.)
   
  Step 2 - Enter the 4-digit Initial Charge of the call. ie. 0035 = $.35
   
  Step 3 - Enter the 4-digit Additional Charge of the call. ie. 0010 = $.10
   
  Step 4 - Enter the 3-digit Initial Time Limit of the call. ie. 015 = 15 mins
   
  Step 5 - Enter the 2-digit Additional Time Limit of the call. ie. 05 = 5 mins
   
  Step 6 - Enter the 4-digit Keypad Activity. ie. 0008 = open keypad during the
           call

  Step 7 - Press the * key to complete the entry. 

** To program a call to have no time limit: 
 
   - set the additional charge at 0000, 
   - set the initial time limit at 255
   - set the additional time limit at 01.

** To disallow keypad use during a call:

   - Set the keypad activity to 0001.
 
 (All program entries are done in the program mode, using the keypad.)


Programming Area Codes

   Special Note:  The CTR-201 is pre-set with all original North American
   area codes, (area codes containing a 0 or 1 as the center digit.) Due
   to an expanding North American Numbering Plan, there have been several
   new area codes added. These area codes are defined by not containing a
   0 or a 1 as the center digit & should be added to the CTR-201. You can
   get a list of these area codes from your local white page directory.

    
   Step 1 - Establish a rate for the area codes your adding using the
            proper Call Type Rate Band. 
            (see Changing or Establishing Rates)
   
   Step 2 - Enter the 4-digit Call Type Code Band. 
            (This directly relates to the Call Type Rate Band.)

   Step 3 - Enter each 3-digit Area Code, separating each one with the * key.

   Step 4 - Press the * key twice to complete the entry. 5xxx xxx * xxx * etc. 

   Call Type Code Band Area Code or Prefix Separator Area Code or Prefix
   Separator Completes the Entry

   Example Entry: 

   5063 888 * 877 * * would add toll free area codes 888 &
   877 & charge the rate established under Call Type Rate Band 6063.

   would make area codes 212,718,& 917 $.25 every 3 minutes.

    
For Area Codes Not Containing a 0 or 1 as the Center Digit:

   Step 1 - Set up Rate Band 6058 as the rate for the surrounding area
            code(s) without a 0 or 1 as the center digit. 
            (see Establishing Rates)
   
   Step 2 - Enter the actual area code(s) under Code Band 5058. (see
            Adding Area Codes)

   Example Entry: 6058 0025 0025 003 03 0008 * 5058 630 * 773 * 847 * *
   would make area codes 630,773, & 847 $.25 every 3 minutes

Separating Local &Toll 7-Digit Calls

In certain area codes, 7-digit calls can be local or a per-minute toll
charge. The following procedure shows the steps necessary to distinguish the
rate for local & toll 7-digit calls, (a prefix is the first 3-digits of a
7-digit number.)              

   Step 1 - Determine whether there are more local or toll prefixes from
            your location.

   Step 2 - Set up Call Type Rate Band 6000 (non-specific 7-digit calls)
            as the rate for the majority of prefixes (local or toll) in
            your area code. (see Establishing Rates)

   Step 3 - Set up Call Type Rate Band 6001 (special 7-digit calls) as the
            rate for the prefixes that there are fewer of (local or toll)
            in your area code. (see Establishing Rates)

   Step 4 - Enter each of the prefixes that there are fewer of in Call
            Type Code Band 5001. (see  Adding Area Codes) These prefixes
            will be charged at the rate established under Call Type Rate
            Band 6001.

   Example Entry: 6000 0075 0075 002 02 0008 * 6001 0035 0000 255 01 0008
   * 5001 550 * 556 * 578 * * would make prefixes 550,556, & 578 $.35 &
   all other 7-digit calls $.75 every 2 minutes

   Adding 1-888 & 1-877 Toll Free Service

    Step 1 - Enter 6063 0000 0000 255 01 0008 *

    Step 2 - Enter 5063 888 * 877 * *

   Example Entry : 6063 0000 0000 255 01 0008 * 5063 888 * 877 * * will

   enable 1-888 & 1-877 calls.
   All program entries are done in the program mode, using the keypad.

Separating 10-Digit & 1+ 10-Digit Calls

   In certain area codes, 10 digit calls (area code + the 7-digit phone
   number,) are local calls & 1+10 digit calls are long distance. The
   following procedure shows the steps necessary to distinguish the rate
   of the two types of calls.

   Note: - The 1+ 10-digit calls will remain in Call Type Rate Band 6008.
   Straight 10-digit calls within the area code being programmed for will
   be assigned to Rate Band 6089 after using the following procedure.

  Step 1 - Enter 311
 
  Step 2 - Enter the Area Code your programming for.

  Step 3 - Hold down the program button & press the # key 7 times,
           release pgm. button & press the * key.
 
  Step 4 - Set up Rate Band 6089 as the rate for the 10-digit calls of
           the area code. (see Establishing Rates)

   Ex. Entry: 311 281 (pgm. button down & # key 7 times) * 6089 0035 0000

   255 01 0008 *

   The above entry would make calls dialed 281 xxx xxxx $.35 & calls
   dialed 1+ 281 xxx xxxx long distance.

Programming a 211 Repair Number

  Step 1 - Enter 6080 0000 0000 255 01 000801 *
    
  Step 2 - Enter 22 & then the number you want called in case of repair
           needed. (Enter a 1 & or Area Code if required when calling the
           reporting number from the payphone.)

   Example Entry: 6080 0000 0000 255 01 000801 * 22 550 5592 would make
   the payphone call 550 5592 anytime 211 is dialed

Programming the Coin Box Amount Security Code

   Step 1 - Enter 293
   
   Step 2 - Enter a four digit security code of your choice.
   
   Step 3 - Press the * key to complete the entry.
   
   Step 4 - Reset the current amount to zero. (see Resetting the Coin Box
            Amount to Zero)       

    Example Entry: 293 1111 * would set the Coin Box Amount Security Code
                   to 1111
   

Re-Setting the Coin Box Amount to Zero(Not done in program mode)

   - Make sure youre not in the Program Mode.
   - Pick up handset & listen for dial tone.
   - Dial * # 5 followed by your 4-digit Coin Box Amount Security Code.

   Example: * # 5  1111 would reset the Coin Box Amount to Zero

Determining the Coin Box Amount (Not done in the program mode)

   - Make sure youre not in the Program Mode.
   - Pick up the handset & listen for dial tone.
   - Dial * # 4 followed by your 4-digit Coin Box Amount Security Code.

   Example: * # 4 1111 would prompt the phone to give the Coin Box Amount
            Security Code

   - The phone will give a 5-digit voice prompt. 
     (Note: zeros will sound like an O.)            

   First Digit = Hundreds / Second Digit = Tens / Third Digit = Ones /
   Fourth Digit = Tenths / Fifth Digit = Hundredths

   Example 1: O 1 1 2 5  would = $11.25 in the coin box

   Example 2: 1 3 4 7 O would = $ 134.70 in the coin box



Testing the Loop Current Level

   A minimum of 22ma (or 44VDC) loop current must be provided to the
   phone from the Telephone Companys Central Office. In certain
   situations, due to the distance between the Central Office and the
   phone site, the loop current may not meet the required level of 22ma.
   If the loop current is below 22ma, dial tone may not occur or the
   phone may experience only momentary burst of dial tone. If the loop
   current level is below 22ma, you should contact your Local Telephone
   Co.         

    ** You will need a current meter to test the loop current level. Set
   the meter to Amps.

  Step 1 - Make sure the incoming tip wire is connected to the terminal
           block inside the lower housing. This wire should be connected
           directly across from the green wire of the pigtail cable.
  
  Step 2 - Make sure the incoming ring wire is disconnected from the
           terminal block inside the lower housing.
   
  Step 3 -  Make sure the incoming ground wire is connected to the
            center terminal screw of the terminal block inside the lower
            housing.

     (Note: Use standard grounding procedures to ensure that the ground
            wire is at the earth ground potential.)

  Step 4 - Disconnect the ring wire (red) of the pigtail cable from the
           terminal block & connect one lead of the current meter to it.
   
  Step 5 - Connect the other lead of the current meter to the
           disconnected incoming ring wire.
   
  Step 6 - Lift the handset off hook and record the loop current level
           shown on the meter. Verify that the reading is greater than
           22ma. 

Problem: No Dial Tone

   Probable Cause: Telephone line dead or improperly connected
   Solution: Check line for dial tone & check terminal block
             for proper connections

   Probable Cause: Battery not plugged in or battery below 3.5 Volts
   Solution: Plug in battery or test with meter for proper voltage (4.8VDC)

   Probable Cause: Stuck coin in trigger switch assembly
   Solution: Remove coin acceptor & trigger switch to find & remove stuck
             coins

   Probable Cause: Handset is miswired or defective
   Solution: Try the following patterns, depending on what color handset
             wires you have:

   Original Handset (Protel): R1 = black  R2 = yellow  T1= green  T2 = red

   Universal Replacement: R1 = green  R2 = yellow  T1 = black  T2 = red

   Universal Replacement: R1 = white  R2 = white  T1=black  T2 = red


   Probable Cause: Hook switch contacts are shorted
   Solution: Set a meter on ohms & disconnect one hook switch wire & put
             one lead of meter on connected wire & one lead of meter on
             disconnected wire. You should have a reading of infinity
             while on- hook & a reading of apx. 00 when off-hook.

   Probable Cause: Upper housing ribbon cable cut or damaged
   Solution: Replace keypad assembly.

   Problem: No disconnect after hanging up
   
   Probable Cause: Hook switch contacts are shorted  
   Solution: Set a meter on ohms & disconnect one hook
   switch wire & put one lead of meter on connected wire & one lead of
   meter on disconnected wire. You should have a reading of infinity
   while on - hook and a reading of apx.00 when off-hook.

   Probable Cause: Telephone line improperly connected
   Solution: Check for proper line installation (see step 9 of installation)

   Problem: Warble Tone

   Probable Cause: Phone needs to be initialized
   Solution: Initialize phone (see initialization procedure)

   Probable Cause: Defective clock chip (CTR-201 ONLY)
   Solution: Replace clock chip

   Problem: Will not detect coins

   Probable Cause: Trigger switch contacts are bent too far apart or are
                   dirty.
   Solution: Make sure all T/S contacts are clean & make
             contact when coin falls through each slot.

   Probable Cause: Coin acceptor rejecting coins
   Solution: Clean inside of coin acceptor with damp, soapy rag.

   Problem Constant Beeping / Relay fires 3 times in a row:

   Probable Cause: Stuck coin in trigger switch.
   Solution: Remove coin acceptor & trigger switch to find &
             remove stuck coins.

   Probable Cause: Bent contact E on relay
   Solution: Remove relay by unscrewing left & right thumb screws & top
             middle screw. Locate contact E & carefully straighten by
             using a pair of needle nose pliers.
 
   Probable Cause: Coin hopper door stuck open
   Solution: Remove relay by unscrewing left & right thumb screws & top
             middle screw. Make sure both hopper levers are in up position.

   Problem: Will not accept coins

   Probable Cause: Coin acceptor rejecting coins.
   Solution: Check to make sure coin acceptor is clean and undamaged.

                         Fun with Cable Modems

                                 Semtex


Firstly the legal bullshit! Okay the information contained in this document is

responsibility for what you do with this information. This information may be
freely reproduced as long as due credit is given to the author (Semtex).

 Okay, you're all excited cause you got that high-speed cable modem installed
and now you are riding the wave (pun intended to Shaw) and surfing like mad.
But oh no, you are pushing the limits of your ISP's transfer rates, you have
dynamic ip's and want static, or you're only given one IP and you need more
'cause you are too lazy to set up a router.

 Well little kiddie listen up cause Obi Wan Semtex will teach you a few tricks
from the way of the force. First off this may not be true of all cable modems
but it has been known to work with Motorola, Terayon, 3com, and Cisco cable
modems.

 First off, a little background on what your cable modem really is. Yes it
modulates and demodulates the signals but it does much much more. Your cable
modem actually acts as a router of minimal proportions and contains its own
OS. On most, this is a stripped down version of an *nix operating system. Now
if you're a good little kiddy you'll go out and research everything you can on
your cable modem, you may even come across a default password that might not
have been changed.

 I know you are all lazy and your saying give me the stuff I need to know to
screw with my cable modem. Well be patient. First you need to know the IP
address of your cable modem (this may also be referred to as your gateway).
Now that you've found that out try telneting to it. This may prove useless or
it may provide you with a ton of information. If you're lucky you'll get a
prompt saying hit enter, and after doing so you'll have complete access to the
configuration of your cable modem. But it is quite likely you won't be that
lucky, however you may get a prompt telling you the OS of the modem. Again
back to the research, maybe you can find the defaults for that OS.

 Okay none of that worked and your stuck with a login prompt no user name or
password. Now you might ask how am I, a little slacker, ever going to get that
password and user name? Well listen up, first off go and do some research (see
a common thread here) on packet sniffers and packet sniffing. Set one up to
sniff the packets to and from your cable modem, make sure it is working
properly cause you may only get one shot at this. Now for the fun part.

 Brush up on your social engineering skills cause its time to make a few phone
calls. Call up your ISP's tech support. Start whining and complaining that you
have an unstable connection. It goes up, it goes down, etc., now watch your
packet sniffer, there is a good chance they'll try and ping your modem. Watch
the ping come in, now they will know they can reach your modem from there.
Here is where knowing a little bit of windoze comes in handy, one of the few
times. Say that windoze is now giving you network errors, "My 'puter says
can't connect to host." Etc. Your goal here is to get the tech to actually
access your modem and try and configure the IP addresses and stuff. A good
complaint is "My winblows says cannot connect to the DCHP server, what's a
DCHP server?" Wham, bam, they connect to your modem via telnet (most cable
modems are not equipped with SSH as they are made for international sales).
Your packet sniffer has grabbed the username and password. You tell the tech
"Hey everything is working great now.". Now don't go out and try to mess with
your cable modem right now, as after a tech call most of the cable companies
monitor your modem to ensure things are properly working. But after the techs
shift ends all is forgotten. Now you can log into your modem and change the
settings from DHCP to grab a static IP, or turnoff the monitoring on your
transfer rates etc.. Now changing these options is not as easy as running
windoze you'll likely need a good background in *nix, as there are no man
pages. Well that's it in a nutshell. Have fun and remember you didn't hear
it from me.

                           More Cable Modem Fun!

responsibility for what you do with this information. This information may be
freely reproduced as long as due credit is given to the author (Semtex).

 If you have read my previous file on cable modems you now can control yours
and make it do whatever you want. Well you can make it do almost everything
you want. But what happens when you loose your job at the Quickie Mart and can
no longer afford to pay for that cable connection? Oh no, your hopes and
dreams of high-speed cable access are now dashed.

 Or are they? Well not if you manage to find yourself a cable modem of your
very own. Believe it or not you can actually buy cable modems retail, or you
can choose not to return the equipment to your cable provider and pay like
$300.00 or some exorbitant amount.

 But now you're asking, how do I get an IP and how do I get added to the
routing tables? Well slow down, you're not at that stage yet. First off, you
have to ensure that you have a cable feed into your domicile. Now we have to
ensure that you can receive the cable modem signals. If you're subscribing to
basic cable there is a good chance that you can already receive the cable
modem signals, but this really depends on your provider. But this is easy to
find out, check your service provider's packages and what they offer as a
"bonus" with their high-speed access. This is a good marketing scam by the
cable companies, get high speed Internet and channels 1 to 32 at no extra
cost. Or, if your cable company is tight fisted they may even choose not to
advertise that with a cable connection you get some channels free by default.

 You see, this all goes into how the old cable system made sure you only got
the channels you paid for. (Note: on completely digital cable networks these
techniques won't work - but stay tuned, in a future article I'll tell you all
about those.) In order to limit your channels, the cable companies had to put
filters on your cable feed. You see, with analog signals the cable company
could not direct just the signals you paid for to your house, instead they
sent everything across the line and put filters in place for the individual
connections. These filters would block out the frequency range containing the
channels that you did not pay for. The signal range for a cable modem is
normally in the channel 2 to 8 range. 

 But we've tested that you still have a live feed coming to the house. Now if
you want to get as many channels as possible find the box outside your house
(either on a pole, in a light standard, or a Telco box) find the line going to
your house and remove the cylindrical objects on your line (these are the
filter). Be advised you are now stealing cable service and in most areas that
is a crime.

 Okay we have the signal coming into the house now lets grab it with our cable
modem. Hook up your cable modem and set up your box, normally DCHP will work
as most cable ISP's do not assign static IP's unless you upgrade to a
commercial package. Well if the gods are smiling on you, you now have Internet
access. But if you are like me and revel in pissing gods off you have to do
additional work. Find someone on the same sub net as you and go to his or her
house and grab an unused IP on the sub net. Hard code this into your computer
(this is called IP Hijacking - for more information on it go to
http://www.hackcanada.com/canadian/hacking/cablehijack.txt). Using the above
reference and the information you gleaned from your friends house you should
now be able to get online using this IP. But hold on little buckeroo one more
thing. Your cable modem has either a mac address or a serial number that
identifies it. We've got to change that. So now, following my instructions
from http://www.hackcanada.com/canadian/hacking/cablemodemfun.txt, telnet into
your modem. Some models allow you to change the serial number within the
modems configuration; curiously enough this also generates a different mac
address. But again that would be if you were lucky. For the unlucky there is a
little more work involved. You have to brute force the configuration settings
until you can change the serial number or mac address. Basically just play
with the settings until something works. Due to the variations in models of
cable modems there is no one defined way to do this. However, as of yet I
have not come across a cable modem that cannot have its configuration settings
changed.

 Just remember, if you do this you are stealing a service and that is illegal.
Also just because you are using a stolen internet account on high speed to
crack your schools computers and change your grades does not mean they can't
track you down. Have fun and I hope you learned something.

                            Digital Cable Fun!
                                    By

 Whoa with all the files on cable stuff that I'm putting out someone might
think I work for the cable company. Well that someone would be wrong! Okay,
let's get down to the meat of the file. 

 So you have or you know someone who has a digital cable box sitting at home.
If you like to be programmed by television programming then you probably like
it very much. But what things does that little digital cable box really do
behind the scenes? Well that digital cable box is actually a computer with
its own complete operating system and storage media. In fact it sends and
receives packets very much like a cable modem. So if it receives and sends
packets the question then becomes can we sniff those packets? If so, how do we
go about sniffing those packets? If we do sniff those packets what will we
find?

 Well we could find a whole bunch of things. Ever hear of a Nelson box? It is
one of those boxes the rating companies use to track what you are watching so
they can in turn sell those statistics back to the networks. The networks take
this information and use it to help them prepare more competitive program
line-ups as well as use it to base their advertising prices. Nelson families
(the people who have the boxes on their televisions) get paid a small fee. But
what if you could have people pay YOU to have a Nelson box in your house? That
in effect is what digital cable boxes provide. They can track what programs
you watch, when you watch them, whether or not you channel surf during the
commercials, and what commercials you actually watch, and what programs you
deem unacceptable for you kids (password blocking those channels). While you
pay to have this box in your house! Very clever, very clever indeed.

 Don't believe me? How can we prove this? Well we can't really prove it
because we don't know what kind of database the cable companies keep on these
statistics but they do have the technology. If you set yourself up to packet
sniff the packets coming to and from your digital cable box you can see for
yourself what information that box sends plus you'll also discover a few ways
to exploit it. So far, on all the digital cable boxes I have seen, they do not
use encryption but be aware, they may be using it soon. 

 How do you packet sniff your digital cable box? 

 Well I'm not about to explain packet sniffing, but there are more than enough
sites out there that you can use in your research. But I will help you track
down the IP of your digital cable box. 

 If you have a cable modem on the same cable feed as your digital cable box
things will be a lot simpler. All we do is set up our packet sniffer to sniff
everything on the local net. This proves really interesting, as you will see
your neighbor's traffic from their computers and digital cable boxes. But you
are looking for YOURS, how do we determine which one it is? Well we have to
again social engineer the cable company. Call them up and tell them you were
in the process of changing the password when your power went out and no you
can't access the channels you want. If your social engineering is effective
you will get them to blank the password. This process takes a while and I'm
sure the cable operator will tell you that. (I personally think it's so kids
can't remove the passwords without mommy or daddy knowing.) If your packet
sniffer is set up correctly you will notice a strange packet coming through
the network, you know this is the right one when your display on the video
cable box flashes. Analyze this packet and you'll have the IP, registration
number, and command code to reset the password of your digital cable box. Now
if you're curious and a true hacker you will go on analyzing packets sent
from your video cable box to capture the command codes. From this information
that you have acquired you can get free pay per view movies, extra channels
not to mention the mischief you can create by screwing with other peoples
digital cable boxes.

              The Primary InterLATA Carrier (PIC) Code Guide


Date: Thursday August 10, 2000
By: The Clone
	

Introduction:

Every single long distance carrier has a unique identificatication number
known as a 10-XXX number (10 followed by the particular network's 3 digit 
access code).


Q: "FIRST, JUST WHAT IS "10XXX" DIALING AND NOW 10-10-XXX DIALING?"
   "Wait, wait, wait a minute! Just what is a PIC code?" 

A: A PIC code is acronym for Primary IntraLata Carrier (PIC) Code. 


Okay, that's better, now on with the 10-10XXX discussion!

The way this works is that this code accompanies each number you dial
from a phone and is then routed by the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC -
i.e., your local phone company) and provides information on the carrier
as well as the number called.

Most telephones uses do not need to dial 10-10-XXX for the long distance 
company that you have chosen to use, because it is programmed by the LEC 
to automatically attach itself to the number being called.

For example, if your carrier is Sprint, their code is 10-10333, and you
dial 760-944-6200, the 10-10333 will tell the call to route over the
Sprint network and provide an identification for the LEC to bill the
appropriate carrier. 

Again, you don't have to dial the 10-10333 PIC code as this is automatically
done for you by the LEC. If you are a Sprint customer and want to place a 
call over, say MCI, you would now have to dial 10-10222 1-760 944-6200 
(Notice: you dial the 1 before the area code, even in your call is going to
the same area code), to force the call off of the Sprint network and onto 
the MCI network. 

(The same holds true for AT&T or WorldCom, 
or the other major 10-10-XXX carriers.)

  " NOW WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO USE A DIFFERENT PIC CODE, 
  EXCEPT FOR THE ONE YOU HAVE FOR YOUR LONG DISTANCE CARRIER? "

(Ever hear of Least Cost Routing (LCR)?) You can have multiple carriers 
approved for an individual line(s) and by knowing the rates associated 
with each, you can have your phone system dial the PIC code that has the 
least expensive rate. 

By the way, if you have a dialer, a PBX with LCR or even if you dial-around
your carrier, you will start having to have 7 digits, instead of 5. 
And should of been completed prior to June 30, 1998, because as of July 1, 1998
your 5 digit PIC or CIC code will not work.

"WELL, WHAT WERE ONCE 5 DIGIT PIC CODES, NOW ARE 7 DIGIT PIC CODES. GOTCHA!"

The FCC was pretty innovative about how they handled the PIC CODE problem; 
they simply put another 10 in front of the existing 10XXX PIC code, 
so a company like ATX Telecommunications Services which was once 10-004 is
now 10-10-004.

   The nomenclature is diverse but it can be simply be referred to as:
10-10 ###, pronounced "ten triple 'ecks". Anywho, here we are with the
updated list of carriers with their new PIC codes. Now folks, I believe
this list to be somewhat accurate, but please note that I do reserve the
right to make an error or two. If in doubt, call the destined carrier
                and ask what their PIC or CIC code is.

 Now on with the list! :)

Conclusion:

Well there you have it!

I hope this document has helped you understand the basic fundamentals
of the Primary InterLATA Carrier code system, as well I hope that the
PIC compilation has saved you some time by making available the codes
you may have been inquiring about. 

If you have some 10-10-XXX carrier codes to share, feel free to shoot me
an e-mail and I'll be more than glad to add them.

Many small to mid-sized airports across Canada and the United States have
special lighting systems which allow the pilots to control the airport
lighting systems. This system is put in place so that
night landings and take-offs can take place, while conserving the energy
which is needed to light up the airports.

The lights in particular which I am talking about are the runway and, in
some places, the approach lights.

The pilot is able to turn the lights on and off from his cockpit by tuning
into a particular VHF station, and keying his mike in three times within five
seconds. When the radio station reads that this has happened it turns the
lights on. To turn them off, you do the same thing again. At some airports
the lights can be turned not only on and off, but to different brightness'.
Low (2 Mike Keys)
Medium (3 Mike Keys)
High (4 Mike Keys)

Now, the same technique can be applied using any VHF transceiver which can go
into the hundreds range. These types of radios can often be bought at flight
shops, and even at radio shack. Within a mile or two of the airport, you just
dial into the freq. for the lighting, and key the mike two, three, or
four times inside of five seconds. The airport lights should turn on almost
magically in front of you.

That's it! It's REALLY that easy! However, I did write this file purely out
of memory as I am away from my home computer right now. However, when I do
get back home, I will be creating a list of every Canadian Airport that has
this feature built into it, and will include the Frequencies for each airport
in the list.

Have fun! But DON'T GET CAUGHT! If you do, it's not my fault!

Hope you enjoyed this fine production from myself (PsychoSpy). Shouts go out
to everyone I met at Def Con 8 and specifically to The Clone, Cyb0rg/Asm,
NE0NRA1N, Wildman, and Semtex. I love the work you guys are doing for the
Canadian scene, keep it up!

The Feds and Me - A Rant By PsychoSpy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know they're there....
Watching me... Listening to me...
They have my lines tapped, my data and e-mails logged...
They harass me, and will not stop...

With their cube vans full of surveillance equipment...
They have photos, my voice... Even my DNA... They invade
my life like the cockroaches they are... No matter how
hard you stomp at them, they never go away... They stay...
For no reason...

They say I'm a harm to society... What do they know?
They are trying to suppress us... Those of us with a special power...

Knowledge is this power... Knowledge is unlike any other power
known to man... No government, or agency can ever take away
what you know... There are but a few things they cannot take
from you... They can't take away your feelings... Your emotions..
Or your knowledge...

They are afraid of what we know... They are afraid that we have
a power they do not...

Knowledge is the power they are afraid of... The want to suppress
it... Kill it... However, it is our knowledge... Our power...
This is the one true power that can never  be taken away
from us...

Keep your knowledge... Keep gaining knowledge... Read, and write
on topics which interest you.. We must keep the power alive...
Without this power, we might as well be dead... Like all the other
drones on this earth whom believe what the media, and government
tell them...

DO NOT BECOME A DRONE! STAND UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN! READ AND
WRITE! KEEP LEARNING, GAINING KNOWLEDGE, AND SHARING THAT KNOWLEDGE.
