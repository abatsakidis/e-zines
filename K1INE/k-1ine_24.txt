 For archivial purposes, the former weblinks for the FAQ will still work.

 The reason for the move?

 Tripod is a horrible place to host a web-site. Banner pop-ups and extra unneeded html code added
 into the html files were enough to make me want to move it. Please be patient while I fix up the
 FAQ so that the images work. Also, FAQ version 2 should be finished sometime in the future as well.
 It's all a matter of finding the time to edit it to perfection.

               The Story of the Millennium Part II (TTY)


  By: The Clone
  Written: Tuesday February 12, 2002


  Introduction:

 This file was written as a follow up to my critically acclaimed
 file "The Story of the Millennium". Although this file doesn't
 have quite the same exciting story line, it's still interesting
 enough to write about because it gives some more insight into
 how TOPS/TTY operator consoles work with each other as well as
 their obvious limitations. Although file may be looked at as
 common knowledge to the advanced phreak, it may help those who
 are new to the phreaking world. Now sit back, relax, and read.

 -

              Definitions:

         CA = Communications Assistant
         GA = Go Ahead
 SK or SKSK = Stop keying, type this before you disconnect
        TDD = Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (no longer used)
        TRS = Telus Relay Service
        TTY = Teletypewriter
          q = q is used to denote a question mark.

  Exposé;

 A couple of days ago while waiting inside my city's wonderful public
 transportation service shelter at Northgate Mall in Edmonton, I decided
 to give my brother a call to see if "Robot Wars" was playing on television.
 Instead of going through the trouble of finding change to place into the
 Millennium payphone, I resorted to using the tty machine that was attached.

  (names and numbers have been modified to protect the innocent/guilty)
 

    * The Clone picks up the payphone's receiver and dials 711 *

     (TTY OP) [ "Telus Relay Operator services, Janice here. GA" ]

  (The Clone) [ "Hi Janice. The Clone here. Calling MSM, 555-1212 GA" ]

    (TTY OP)  [ "Thank you, one moment. Ring 1, Ring 2, Ring 3...
                 MSM on line. GA" ]

  (The Clone) [ "Hey, MSM. Clone here... what time is Robot Wars on? GA" ]

    (TTY OP)  [ "MSM: It's on right now. Come home now." ]

  (The Clone) [ "Alright see you. SKSK" ]

          - CALL ENDS -

  I proceed to hang up the receiver, and watch in amazement as
  the TTY keyboard closes into its box. Wow, technology is neato.

  Bored, and still waiting for my bus to arrive, I decide to use
  this free calling service to my advantage and call my girlfriend.
  I pick up the receiver again, dial 711 and wait for that nice tty-churp.
  To my dismay, I get a voice-recording "Please hang up and dial again"
  as well as a text message on the Millennium's LCD-display saying the
  exact same thing.

  Pissed off and confused (happens a lot), I proceed to hang up the
  phone and dial 711 again. After about a minute of doing this over
  and over, I grow tired and decide to dial "0" for the operator.

  Immediately after dialing "0", I get an operator...

  (Operator) [ "Thank you for calling Telus, David speaking." ]
 
 (The Clone) [ "Yes, I'm at a Millennium payphone right now with
                my friend who is deaf. He's trying to use the TTY
                enabled payphone but when we dial 711, the keyboard
                doesn't come out and allow us to talk to a TRS op."

 (Operator)  [ "Umm.. okay. Umm... (uncomfortable silence)" ]

 (The Clone) [ "Are you going to help us or not?" ]

 (Operator)  [ "Yes, just a second. I'm going to transfer
                you to 711. Do you want voice or data TTY?
                    Ahh I'll give you data.." ]

 (The Clone) [ "Data? You're stupid, but okay give it a shot..." ]

 (Operator)  [ "I love it when you call me that. One moment." ]

 (The Clone) [ "Alright, thank you." ]


  Now the 0+ TOPS operator tries to transfer the voice call through
  a data trunk and I get all sorts of weird messages. First off,
  I hear 2 seconds of static, followed by a 2200hz tone, then the
  message "The number you have dialed is long distance...", then
  it cuts out and I get the message "Please hang up and dial again.",
  then the call is suddenly seized and it hangs up on me. Obviously
  TOPS operator consoles don't have the ability to route voice to TTY
  data trunks, or else I would of been communicating with a friendly TRS.

  Even more angry and communication deprived, I call "0" again and get
  connected with an operator named "Sally". I proceed to ask Sally if
  she's the same Sally from the movie "When Harry met Sally", and if so
  could she please do the fake orgasm "thing" (just kidding).

  So I tell Sally the sad story about how my friend couldn't get through
  to the TRS operator when calling 711 at a TTY-enabled payphone, and
  how when I spoke to David the 0 operator, I got misrouted.

  Sally replied "Well sir, I'm sorry that David didn't realize the
                 limitations of our routing. Also, he should of known
                 you can't route voice to TTY-data! Just a second,
                 I'll route you to a voice operator who can enable
                      the TTY machine from her console..."

                 [ Call forwards ]

 The pulse-stream MF (Modular Frequency) looked something like this:
 
     (minus the finer points of ANI spills that are
       beyond the obvious scope of this article)

     KP + || + 3/10D + ST + KP + 711 + 02 + ST

     || = 2 information digits - typical values are:

     00 Normal ANI  ...  10 digits follows
     01 ONI line    ...  NPA follows
     02 ANI failure ...  NPA follows
     
     3/10D = 3 or 10 digits. When 3 digits is sent,
             that's the NPA, when 10 digits is sent,
             it's the entire NPA+PREFIX+SUFFIX.
   
     KP/ST = control tones

 -

 Operator answers the call: "Thank you for calling Telus Relay
                             Operator services, Jennifer speaking."
                            
                 The Clone: "Hi there. My friend, who is deaf,
                             is trying to use the TTY machine
                             attached to this payphone. Can
                             you please enable the TTY machine,
                             and verify my ANI information. Thanks."
              
               TTY-Operator: "Just a moment. Sir, we have an ANI failure.
                                What number are you calling from?"

                               (at this point I give her the modem
                                  pool # for Edmonton Freenet...)

                  The Clone: "Oh, it's 428-3929."

               TTY-Operator: "Thank you. I'll enable the TTY now..."

                  I hear the high pitched TTY-churp on the receiver, and
                  the keyboard comes out, allowing me to place the call.
                  The call goes through, and I'm happy as a candy-rayvER
                  on ecstasy (minus the gayness).

               ! Buddah-Bing-Buddah-Boom: Simple Social Engineering will
                                          allow you to op-divert and spoof
                                          your actual ANI information. =) 
  -

  Final Words;

 It's always neat to learn about limitations the TOPS console to TTY
 console have, as well as the numerous fun one can have by spoofing
 their identity via simple op divertion... Have a nice day!

Calaway Park is in are code 403 about 20 minutes out of calgary... down that way where Canada
olympic park is. (www.calawaypark.com)

CALAWAY PARK 
245033 Range Road 33
Calgary, Alberta, Canada T3Z 2E9
Phone: (403) 240-3822 Fax: (403) 242-3885

240-3822 is the main number. You can reach telephones from within the park, on theyre PBX
from this number.

There is only 5(6?) payphones in the park. Last i saw they were Telus Centurions.
The first one is found right before the main entrance, the next one(last i saw there
was two beside eachother, one with a malfunctioning hopper..) They are just on the 
otherside of the entrance turnstyles gate.(Right outside the Hud Stones gift store)

The next one is by the market place games area (look for the golden goblet game, you cant
miss it.) It is between the bathrooms.

The next one is next to the Terace Garden. You can always ask the recpsionist for a local
call near the park entrance.

Just get a paper map from somewhere, ask the employees.

,,
As always, when you see a phone inside the vacinity of the park, look for the large 
orange/black sticker with a 3 digit number. This is the extension number.
There is a cabinet behind the Burger Hut, behind the white fence. Bring a garbage bag with
you for the dumpster so as not to look suspicious.

The actual key system's location may or may not be in this large cabinet. It is a secluded
location, however. Your on your own here

The intercomm that plays music is actually controlled by some DJ (rumour is in the warehouse
 this is unconfirmed) and apparently he just spins CDs. I don't remember if the key system
is used to bust in on the music, you can find out very easily. "ive been looking for
my little sister for 3 hours" (goto the guest services booth)

They may just phone security who inturn uses the CB radio system to communicate with the
security guys. Bring your CB radio and bust in on theyre air space. They use common 10-
codes. Some "sani's" (sanitian monkeys, the 14 year olds) have CB radios.

Security should't be fucked with. 173 will get you a security guy sitting in a booth at
the employee entrance. He has a TV and a CB radio, and is considered base station.
All employees entering the park are logged, also leaving. All telephone calls are also
logged. You can try eaves dropping with your CB, and see what you can social engineer.

You could get a few names of the suite monkeys and phone security, saying that your
from telus doing repair on the payphones, and you were told to use the back entrance.
Cruise the parking lot untill you see the booth. Contemplate the world

The games.

They're all rip-offs. Don't play them unless your trying to get snatch from your girlfriend.
Some games are based of skill, most are chance, some are fluke.

The dart throwing game is sure fire unless your a fucking loser. It costs abit to trade
up the animals, but its a sure investment unless your a fucking loser.

Tin can alley looks easy but is not. Stay away.

Golden goblet is a good random game, if you win, its probably something decent.

The ring toss (them little red rings have to land on the neck of an antique cock bottle) is
fucking near impossible no matter how you throw them. Ive thrown two handfuls from those
fucking baskets and not one ring mated a bottle.

The best is bushle basket. Throwing baseballs into a basket mounted on a wall looks easy,
or difficult, depending on your logic. Most people think the trick is, the springs in the
bottom of the basket that arent there. Throwing the ball so its point of apogee is equal
to the height of the basket is difficult. The trick is to stand NOT infront of the basket
but to the side. Use a side arm toss and throw the ball into the basket so that it will roll 
up and around and come to a rest. No bouncing. Just dont stand in front of the fucking thing.

That water gun game isn't fair. One gun seems to have more pressure then the others, for
many different reasons which i care not to go into. Observe which gun has the most pressure
as it will shoot straighter and more acurate. If the operator doesnt state you can double team
(two people squirting one target) then do so. The rules sign doesn't forbid against this, and
unless you were explicitly told before the game has started, the customer is in the right.
Just ask to speak to someone with the shiney gold name tag 

_*_
Food.

Employees get a discount, go through the door near the entrance with the first aid
sign on it, walk past the first aid office and down the stairs on your right. This is the
employee lounge. Buy food cheaper here, uniform is not required because your new and haven't
gotten it yet. There is a payphone down here too, although this area is most often heavily
trafficed, mostly with managers and shit. Get your food and book

Calaway park sells Those Little Donuts, and they certainly are orgasmic. The scam is all that
oil, as soon as the donuts begin to loose theyre warmth they turn hard, into a rock stage where
they are not consumable. Eat them fast 

+....
Other

The trout pound is a piss hole. Cheat and bring your own bait. Make sure it is white
like the dough you are given. Get the longest pole and drop your hook into the water, slowly
pull the bait straight up, 6 inches below the surface, and then slacken the line and let 
the bait fall down, repeat this process as it taunts the already insane fish, they want 
to die.

The fish are fed every morning, try later in the day. When you catch one, ask the operator
if you can kill the fish(they club it on the head with a pipe)

                           USING JUNO'S FREE INTERNET SOFTWARE, THE FREE WAY.
                                      by: itch        feb 9th, 2002


_DISCLAIMER_ 
This file is provided for informational purposes only and any and all activities that you carry out 
after reading this text are not my responsibility-they are yours.  THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS FILE VIOLATE 
JUNO'S TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS), AND YOU SHOULDN'T DO THEM, AND I DONT DO THEM EITHER.

_INTRODUCTION_
Hello, today i am going to discuss juno's free internet package, and how it works on a rather basic level.  I will 
also talk about the methods that they use to create accounts, and how to create accounts the easiest way possible. 
Juno provides a method for users to connect to the internet for free using juno's software. Of course we are not 
getting something for nothing, so the software forces users to view an ad bar. As far as i know the only two remaining 
free internet services that work in this way are Juno and Netzero.  Netzero is weird shit and it's download is much 
too big for me to even bother to look at at this point, plus, when I did investigate earlier versions it seemed much 
more difficult to use and from what I've read, it still is. Juno provides their software at http://www.juno.com, the 
current version is 5.0.33 I believe.  I think they say that it is for north american users, but the fact is that when 
you are creating an account, they force you to say your American, so in order to use the software you have to at least 
make up your address.  This seems pretty silly to me so I thought that maybe they don't actually support Canadian users, 
but after you fill in your info, and you have to choose which dial up number to use, they let you pick Canadian numbers, 
so i don't know what's going on there.  

_USAGE_
So you download the software, install it, run it, and make a new account and all that, yea! you have free internet 
access! except it sucks.  you have to watch lame ads, and run their software.  plus their software is slow, and big, 
it takes a lot of memory, and if your someone like me who occasionally uses a 486, this is no good!  also they are 
probably watching everything you do with the software and selling you to marketing agencies.  So you have a problem, 
you want the free connection, but you don't want the lame software...don't worry, you can have the best of both worlds!  
Also, juno doesn't support dos, linux, or any other OS, they only support windows (and maybe mac????).  As far as I can 
tell what juno does is dial into the access node with their software, and sends the real login and password that was 
issued to you (not the user name that you gave it) and then it initiates a windows dial up networking tcp/ip connections, 
and monitors this, all the whilst running the sluggish software.  If you try and close the software, it will shut down 
the tcp/ip connection most of the time, but apparently if you do it right you can manage to kill the software and leave 
the connection. This may seem cool but its not, you have to run the software anyways, and usually it doesn't work, so 
it's not really a viable solution.  There is a program called Beware of Dog, which I tried to use along time ago, it 
basically tries to kill the software and leave the connection.  I suppose it is a good idea but it was never very 
convenient, and I never had a lot of success with it.  So here is the solution, the UCf people have written this rad 
little program called RASSPY which basically runs itself, then runs the free isp (or any other program that uses dun 
to connect) while monitoring what is being done. When it sees the program run the dial up networking application stuff 
or whatever it pops up with a little screen with the actual login and password of the actual connection.  For juno the 
login will be the letter "u" followed by another letter (often "j" or "b"), followed by ten digits then 
"@jweb.juno.com" so a username might look something like this:"uj0695826195@jweb.juno.com". The password is a 16 
character long string made up of digits, and both cases of letters.  a password may look like this: "1GiEJzn2QIx9BFtV".  
Once rasspy has giving you these strings, you can run "Make a New Connection" from your dial up networking folder, 
put in the phone number (which rasspy also gives you but you can see when you sign up anyways), and the actual login 
and password, and then connect to it like you would to any real paid isp.

_JUNO'S TRICKS_
Juno doesn't like you doing this, so after a while, they catch on somehow, I don't know how they do but they do.  any 
time after you are using your free account, they may kill it.  I can't tell you how long it will last, it could last 
anywhere from 3 days to months.  When they do kill it you will have to make another one, except juno uses trickery!  
When you sign up, they assign you a machine ID which they hide in your registry.  Your machine id is a string 
comprised of capital letters and numbers, yours could look like this: "A4EWE45AAA8GMDXGAAA35GMCD9WZZW".  As far as i 
know it is not really based on anything, but I suppose it could be.  When they kill your account the sort of 'black 
list' your machine id and don't let you get any more accounts.  So in order to get a new account you need to change or 
remove your machine id.  If you remove it has the same effect of changing it, but is easier.  The Machine id is 
located in your registry at:  "My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\JUNO.JAnimCtrl.1", and is a string named "Anim Script".  
So if you want to make a new account after being locked out you have to get rid of this, you could open up regedit 
whenever you have to do this, or you could use a much easier method: open up notepad and create a file called 
"junofix.reg" or something, the name doesn't matter as long as its extension is ".reg" in this file put the following 
lines:

------------cut------------          

REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\JUNO.JAnimCtrl.1]
"Anim Script"=""

------------cut------------  

and save your file.  Now double click on the file and it will ask you if you want to add the information to your 
registry, and then if you click yes it will confirm that it has been added.  All this does is over write the Anim 
Script string with one of the same name, but no data.  If you are running some weird windows version you may need 
to use a different format for this file, but in any case you can still do it, first, look in the "juno\bin\" 
sub-directory and open a file called "eventlog.log", look for where it says MACHID A4EWE45AAA8GMDXGAAA35GMCD9WZZW 
or whatever and copy your machine id.  open up regedit and do a search for the string, when if finds it click on 
it once to highlight it, then click 'registry'->'export registry file', export it to the desktop or whatever, open 
it, and replace your machine id with spaces or nothing or whatever, and save it.  So now you can run it whenever you 
want to wipe your machine id, and create a new account.

_CREATING A NEW ACCOUNT-THE EASY WAY_
Wasn't that annoying when you had to create a new account, all that fuss and bother you had to go through: filling 
out endless forms and fields? Well do we have the solution for you!.....Okay juno checks for a file called 
tmpuser.ini in the "juno\lib\" sub directory when you go to make a new account, if it finds it with the right info 
in it, it assumes you've already started making an account and cancelled, so it loads in your address, and name and 
all that for you, so create this file in the juno root directory and include the following lines:

------------cut------------  

[UserInfo] 
User= 
Password= 
Salt= 
ECHO is off
[User Profile] 
Login= 
6012=1 
Profile modified=true 
6011=6012 
6003=YOURFIRSTNAME         ********* 
6007= 
6005=YOURLASTNAME          ********* 
6009=xxx YOURADDRESS       *********
6006= 
6000=YOURCITY              *********    
6016=XX                    ********* (two letter state abrieve) 
6015=USA 
6010=XXXXX                 ********* (5 number zip code) 
6001=(XXX) XXX-XXXX        ********* (phone number) 
6002=(XXX) XXX-XXXX        ********* (phone number) 

------------cut------------  

Remember, change all the XX's to proper things, and take out all stars and my comments, they are just there to 
show you what needs changing, only the lines with stars on them need changing.

Now you can make a batch file that copies this file to the "\lib" directory when ever your about to make an account, 
this way you won't have to fill in your name and address.  You will have to copy this time every time you are making 
a new account because the file gets changed after making the account. Well this is just great! but wait, we still 
have to answer all the stupid survey questions!, don't worry! the fix for this is quick!  every time an account is 
created on your computer, a directory is created like this : "juno\USER0001\" and inside here there is a file called 
"juno.ini" This file manages many of the personalized operations in the running of the juno software, and also the 
creation of new accounts.  In the first section of this juno.ini ([UserInfo]) there is a line that looks like this: 
"Update Profile=TRUE" or "Update Profile=FALSE", when it is true, you have to fill out the damn survey, when it is 
false, you don't.  Also if you delete the juno.ini it creates a new one without the "Update Profile=TRUE".  So after 
creating the new account, and cancelling as soon as it says "your new account has been created" or whatever (before 
the survey), you go into which ever JUNOXXXX directory belongs to this account and delete juno.ini, and run 
"rasspy cmd=C:\program files\juno\bin\juno.exe" (or whatever your path is).  RASSPY will run juno, you will enter your 
password, and rasspy will give you the real password without ever having to fill out any survey.

_ENDER_
So the process is this, run junofix.reg, copy tmpuser.ini to the 'juno\lib\' directory, run juno, create a new account, 
click cancel before the survey, go into the new accounts directory (should be 'USER0000' if you have deleted all the 
previous (and dead) accounts), run rasspy with the command line argument to run juno, put in your password when juno 
comes up, click 'World Wide Web', copy the login and password that RASSPY gives you, close juno, create a new dun 
connection, and connect to the internet.  It seems like alot of work, but it's not, it takes about 5 minutes if you get 
used to it.  I have written a batch file that does everything for me, all i have to do is click all the "next"s.
I hope this has ben interesting, and not too long.  The whole juno thing is quite flawed but I love it to death.  
Remember, I have not actually done any of this, as it is probably illegal and I don't do illegal things, i only pretend 
to be cool.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.


Thanks to the guys who put out rasspy, its good shit, and that's about it.

	 Constructing a marijuana pipe out of a payphone handset

 By: Phlux

 A pay-telephone handset is indeed an artifact to anyone who owns one,
 aside from making nunchucks, one can easily construct a marijuana pipe
 from such a handset (assuming its made out of bakelite, find one that
 is or you're a sand nigger). The innards should be removed, the blue
 flexible piece is optional, I would remove it for cleaner tokes but
 this is optional depending on your ethnic origin. The handset and the
 2 screw on covers are to be boiled in water to kill any bacteria that
 might affect your drug paraphenalia. A screen is to be tied to the
 inside of the earpiece screw cover, where there should only be 6 holes
 in a cluster arrangement no larger then the circumference of a screen.
 Two wires from the screen should be carefully unwoven, so that when the
 screen is placed on the inside (NOT OUTSIDE!) of the screw on earpiece,
 the wires can be threaded through the screen and the holes of the earpiece
 so they can be tie wrapped on, much like a button on a shirt. You now have
 a normal looking telephone handset which can be used to smoke decent size
 one hitters, and hash - place a ball of hash in the middle hole, hold the
 handset to the side(at a slite over-vertical slant) putting your lips to
 the hole where the armored cable was, holding a small lighter flame near
 the hash, effectively vaporizing it for consumption.
