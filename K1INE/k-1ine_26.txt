The History of the Internet
===========================

By: Trigger

04/12/02

Intro
-----

What we now know as the Internet started out as a means for the US Military 
to communicate in the event of war. The military needed a network that was 
versatile so that if links were broken information could be rerouted and 
still make it to its original destination. For the first 10 years, the 
Internet was only used by scientists and the military. It was only in the 
1980's that corporations got involved. In the 1990's ordinary people began 
to use the Internet for everything from information purposes to buying a new 
boat. By the year 2000 almost everyone in US and Canada had access to it and 
so did most other countries.


The Conceiving
--------------

In 1957, the USSR launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. In 
response to this, the US Department of Defense issued directive 5105.15 [1] 
thus creating the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) [5]. In 1959, Dr. 
Leonard Kleinrock (MIT) submitted a PhD proposal to study data networks. On 
May 31, 1961, Kleinrock finished his paper, AInformation Flow in Large 
Communication Nets.@[5] This was the first paper published on packet 
switching (PS). Packet switching is a process in which packets (small 
segments of data) do not have a static path in a network. A packet can be 
routed and redirected as needed. This means that if a route was severed, a 
new route could be chosen by the software. In 1968, the packet switching 
process was presented to ARPA. That same year, ARPA gave a Cambridge-based 
company, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) the job to implement and establish 
the ARPANET. This first switch was named an Interface Message Processor 
(IMP), and was based upon a newly developed Honeywell minicomputer [5].


In the Beginning
----------------

On labor day weekend, 1969, the IMP switch was delivered to UCLA. Everyone 
who had any reason to be there was there. The team of forty was responsible 
for linking the network. This was quite the challenge, seeing as this had 
never been done. On Monday the team was able to transmit the first bits (a 
piece datum that is either 1 or 0) to the ARPANET. The team worked around 
the clock. By the following day they were able to send massages. At that 
moment the Internet was born.


Youth
-----

Shortly following the advent of the Internet, in 1970, a new node was being 
added each month. Bob Metcalf built a high speed (100Kbps) network interface 
that connected the MIT IMP and a PDP-6 to the ARPANET. This device ran for 
thirteen years without human intervention [3]. Network Working Group 
finished the Telnet Protocol and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Using 
Telnet a user can login to a remote system and run commands present on the 
remote computer. Using FTP a user can connect to a remote computer and 
transfer files over the Internet. That year the first host-to-host protocol 
(NCP) was implemented into ARPANET. Also the first packet radio (ALOHAnet) 
was created in Hawaii. Packet radio is sending data over a wide area network 
(WAN) using RF (radio frequency) diation. The RF signals are transmitted 
though the air and are reflected off of the ionosphere back down to earth, 
thus allowing packet radio to cover vast distances.

In 1973 the Unix-to-Unix Protocol (UUCP) was created, allowing dial-up 
connections to be possible. With all this new development there was an 
emerging problem. ARPANET, PRNet (packet radio networks), and SATNET 
(network over a satellite) all had different sizes of packets, transmission 
rates, labels, and conventions which caused obvious communication problems. 
[5] In response to this dilemma, in September 1973, INWS published the first 
paper on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). On March 23, 1977, ARPA's name 
was changed to DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).

In 1978, TCP split into TCP and IP (Internet Protocol) [5]. The original IMP 
was only capable of communicating with 64 nodes. IP can route up to a very 
large number of nodes. Since IP addresses are 32 bit, ideally there should 
be a capability of having 232 nodes, but because of other reasons beyond the 
scope of this text, this is not the case. IP also restricts packets to a 
maximum number of hops (network jumps). This prevents packets from getting 
into indefinite loops. Fragmenting allows packets to be broken up into 
smaller pieces if their size is too large for a particular network. TCP 
allows packets to choose a specific service running on the remote computer 
(port) and allows a sliding window to keep track of packets. TCP uses a 
3-way hand shake method in order to prevent IP spoofing (faking one=s IP 
address). The 1st of January, 1983, was the day of transition on the ARPANET 
from NCP to TCP/IP. In the same year ARPANET split into the ARPANET and the 
MILNET.

There was one problem with IP. It was too difficult to remember the 32 bit 
addresses, especially when there were thousands of them. To solve this 
problem, in 1984, DNS (domain name sever) was introduced. DNS had a list of 
domain names, and when queried would return the appropriate IP address. DNS 
allowed .gov, .mill, .edu, .org, .net, .com, and .int to be used.

In 1985 Dan Lunch in cooperation with IAB realized there was a lack of 
information about the Internet and arranged a 3-day workshop for all of the 
vendors to learn TCP/IP. The majority of the speakers were from the DARPA 
community. [6]. This allowed for the commercialization of the Internet. From 
1986 to 1988, the amount of networks connected jumped from 2,000 to 30,000 
[3].


Loss of Innocence
-----------------

On November 2, 1988, the first worm was created by a man named Morris and it 
infected ~10% of the 60000 hosts. To fight this new threat DARPA created 
CERT (computer emergency response Team)[5]. (CERT regularly publishes 
advisories about holes in network programs.)

In 1989 Berner-Lee proposed "hypertext" which consequently created the World 
Wide Web. In 1990, the ARPANET was formally shutdown. The first search 
engines were created (ARCHIE, Gopher, and WAIS) [4]. By this point there 
were 300,000 hosts throughout Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, Greece, India, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, US, And Switzerland [3].

In 1995 Microsoft unveiled Windows 95. Although they were not the first to 
release an object oriented operating system with network capabilities, they 
were the first to make it easy for people to understand. People no longer 
needed to be knowledgeable about computers in order to operate them. This 
was exactly what was needed for people to be attracted to the computer and 
Internet world, something easy and manageable. With this new craze of people 
on the Internet, the corporate sector began to pay attention, and quickly 
learned how to capitalize on it. With all these people and businesses 
connected, the were once again running out of Internet addresses. To correct 
this, IPv4 (the one currently used) had been revised to IPv6, which supports 
128 bit addresses. With IPv6 there is the possibility to have trillions of 
networks each having trillions of nodes.


In the End
----------

Way back in 700 BC, homing pigeons carried messages in ancient Greece. 
People of this time could unlikely even fathom the conncept of such 
exchanges of information that the Internet transfers every day. The Internet 
was once a means of communication for the us military and has developed into 
a world of its own. As this world grows, fueled by the imagination and hard 
work of many people, it is becoming part of our lives. As these two worlds 
merge, we must ask ourselves, is the Internet a part of us, or are we 
becoming a part of it?

		'Unfair Business Practices by Radio Station K106.3'
 
 Bill Duke

 bse5150@hotmail.com

 Wed Apr 3 2002

 I need your help... This is going to sound crazy but I assure you it is absolutely true.

 Some of you may remember me from September of last year (2001), I posted a message to this
 discussion board about a webpage that I had created to expose the practices of a radio station
 in Sarnia, Ontario Canada. The radio Station was 106.3fm or K106.3. I don't know if anybody remembers
 it or not or if anybody here had checked it out or not... There were copies of emails I had received
 from the program director and other miscellaneous articles.

 Anyway, none of what was posted on that webpage was illegal or false and they couldn't really do anything
 to me for having it available... Charter of Rights and things like that.

 A little bit of background information... In Sarnia, Ontario there are three radio stations, 106.3fm, 99.9fm
 and 1070 CHOK am. All three radio stations are operated out of the same building and all three are owned and
 operated by Blackburn Radio Inc. based in London, Ontario. All three radio stations are programmed by Ron Dann
 (I posted some of the emails I received from him on my website.)

 On September 24, 2001 Ron Dann called me at my home to speak to me about removing my website. I reluctantly agreed
 to allow him to remove the site (The URL was http://www.geocities.com/k106slam/) as I had just begun a new job and
 did not have a whole lot of time available to maintain it. In exchange for the userid and password for the website
 I required that Ron Dann or Radio Sarnia/Lambton (as the three radio stations are collectively known) to place a
 link to the CBSC (Canadian Broadcast Standards Council) on their own website and asked that they do nothing to
 intentionally antagonize me.
 
 Pretty good tradeoff if you ask me...

 Well, Ron Dann removed the website on September 26, 2001 and as agreed, he did place a link to the CBSC on the
 K106.3 website. This did not last long and it was removed and Ron Dann and his cronies began doing everything in
 their power to antagonize me and bring me into public ridicule.

 Here's where it starts to get interesting...

 On July 27, 2000 an engineer working for Fluor-Daniel out of Calgary, Alberta called the police and accused me of
 stalking  her. Her name is Josee Plante. I have a file floating around elsewhere on the internet with regard to this
 matter, as well as a website I am setting up...

 The fact of the matter is that the allegations filed against me were false and no police action was ever taken other
 than having an officer come to speak with me. Regardless, the complaint does to this day remain on my record even
 though nothing ever happened with it...

 Fast forward just over a year and your getting to the time when the K106slam page was set up... Around this time all
 of the  stuff from the stalking allegations resurfaces along with a whole pile of other gossip and falsehoods.

 I'm stuck as for direction... I've already established a lot of the facts but there are a bunch of things that continue
 to allude me...

 For example:

 I've established that both Josee Plante as well as Ron Dann and others at Radio Sarnia/Lambton are involved.

 I've established that photos and/or video of me exists and is circulating throughout the internet.

 I've established that another person, Philip Leval (Laval?) is also involved. It is believed that this person is
 also an employee of Fluor-Daniel or somehow involved with the Muskeg River Project in Alberta although I haven't
 yet confirmed this as it is new information.

 I've also established a definitive link between the above mentioned people and Radio Sarnia/Lambton.

 If anybody would be interested in helping me crack this case... I would very much appreciate it. Thanks.

  \/ERIZON |ELECONFERENCING ||

 BY: k00p$ta Phr34k and ic0n

 Before we begin this file I (ic0n&k00p$ta) are not going to give you any info on setting up the conference.
 For a few reasons but it's not hard at all the setup once since everyone @ verizon is crazy or just dumb minus
 a selected few (they know who they are). Now on with the file. Verizon now offers a new service, Conference
 Connections.These Conferences's are reservation-less, which means around the clock availability. The Conference
 is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days out of the year. This makes conferencing very easy.

 Thanks Verizon!

 There's 2 ways to dial into a verizon conference.

 1. Toll Free dial in number (866-441-2942)

 2. Direct (972-717-2043) Npa 972 is in Texas

 There are no setup fees, no cancellation fees, and no monthly charges.
 Which mean you can setup a teleconference and your victim will not even
 know he's got a teleconference being billed to him. The minutes your
 participants used are logged separately logged by differnt ports.
 There are 20 of these ports but I'm sure there is a way to get more.

 Anyways the minutes are added together to simplify the subscribers bill,
 in addition are required taxes. There is a separate bill for toll free
 service as well. States that need to use the direct number to the conference:

 1. Alaska

 2. Delaware

 3. Maryland

 4. New Jersey

 5. New Hampshire

 6. Virginia

 7. Vermont

 8. Washinton D.C.

 9. West Virginia

 * Once again the direct number is 972-717-2043 *

 The reasoning behind the direct numbers is that Verizon provides long distance
 services for calls originating in most states outside the mid-Atlantic and new
 England states. Until government approval is obtained, Verizon cannot carry long
 distance in the states listed above. Verizon is in the works on getting the necess-
 ary states and federal permissions to offer long distance in every state.


 Rates Cents per minute per port Until 3/30/02

 Normal    Toll Free
 $0.22     $0.31

 Direct
 $0.09 - $0.18
