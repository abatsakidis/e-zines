   News: 120 FBI agents arrest 1 Saudi student


 Date: Wed, 5 Mar 2003 13:13:12 -0800 (PST)
 From: Bilal Elamine <zaloom33@yahoo.com>
 To: Left Turn <anticapitalists@yahoogroups.com>,
   no blood <nobloodforoil@lists.riseup.net>
 Subject: [No] 120 FBI agents arrest 1 Saudi student

 From: Prof. Elizabeth Brandt from Univ. of Idaho:

 Well,  yesterday was an exciting day in my small town. The FBI flew
 in 120 agents, fully armed in riot gear, on two C-17 military aircraft
 (I think  -- they were BIG planes) to Moscow Idaho (population 17,000+/-)
 to arrest one Saudi graduate student for visa fraud. The raid went down
 in University of Idaho student housing at 4:30 a.m. in the morning,
 terrorizing not only the suspect's family (he lived in student housing
 with his wife and three elementary school age children) but also the
 families of neighboring students who were awakened by the shouting and
 lights and were required to remain in their homes until after 8:30 a.m.
 
 At least 20 other students who had the misfortune to either know the
 suspect or to have some minor immigration irregularities were also
 subjected to substantial, surprise interrogations (4+ hours) although
 none were detained or arrested yesterday. Now, however, a witch hunt
 for additional unamed suspects who supposedly helped the guy who was
 arrested is on.
 
 The INS and FBI are working together using gestapo tactics to
 question the students -- threatening their immigration status (and
 hence their education) if they don't answer questions which are really
 aimed at the criminal investigation. They have also threatened their
 partners and spouses with perjury charges if they don't talk.
 
 I spent yesterday working with our immigration clinic director and
 local criminal defense attorneys to organize legal representation for
 the students who are being swept into the hunt for co-conspiritors. 
 We have reached out to our entire area (40 -mile radius) to find
 enough attorneys.  Now I'm working on getting resources and support
 to them. The Saudi government is providing financial support.
 
 Reading about this stuff is one thing.  Having it in your backyard
 is another.  The international students at the University of Idaho
 are terrorized and scared.

	When a Journalist and a Prosecutor Lie to the Public 


 These series of e-mail's were sent to me from a concerned reader
 who ran across this news article while browsing through Hack Canada.

 "After reading the statements made by Keith Gerein and Steve Bilodeau,
 I can't help but feel a deeper sense of dislike towards the media, especially
 the ones controlled by CanWest Global Communications who amount to virtually
 all the major media outlets in Canada. I felt I needed to express my feelings
 on this and so I passed it on to Nettwerked and Hack Canada. This goes to show
 that people shouldn't believe anything they read in the newspaper. Infact I
 recommend you try and get news from various sources, and of course alternative
 media. Don't forget to do your homework because you never know when you'll be
 flat out lied to. The crap that was published on Friday by the Edmonton Journal
 was a joke, and a complete farce" said 'Anonymous Hero', who requested we keep
 their real name private.

 Here are the e-mail messages sent between Anonymous Hero and Keith Gerein.
 You decide what is truth and what is made up bullshit.

 Subject: "Wreaking havoc on the Net will bring down wrath of the law"


 Keith Gerein,

 I don't know where to start. I've never read a technology article filled
 with such mis-information in my life. This e-mail isn't meant to offend,
 but when you write articles on subjects such as computer crimes, you should
 probably consider doing research and communicating with people who have
 real knowledge on these technical subjects.


 "Computer and Internet crime is a growing global problem, he said, noting
 that the proceeds from Internet fraud around the world in 2001 amounted to
 more than $1 billion Cdn. Since then, it has likely gone up."

 - On the contrary, according to Fraud.org:

 'The amount of money consumers are losing to Internet fraud is increasing.
  Losses overall are $6,152,070, up from $3,387,530 in 2000.'

 'The average loss per person rose from $427 in 2000 to $518 in 2001.'

 (Proof: http://www.fraud.org/internet/2001stats.htm)

 "Bilodeau said his interest in high-tech crime was piqued when he heard
 about a case in the United States. A teen in Massachusetts who wanted free
 long distance calls decided to tap into the phone switch box at the end of
 his block. In the process, he knocked out power to an entire grid, including
 the system that controlled the runway lights at the local airport."

 - Again no references to this ever even happening. If someone claimed this
 happened, it was an outright lie. The teen in Massachusetts who was trying
 to get free telephone calls was likely doing what the hacker (more
 specifically the 'phreaking') community calls "Beige Boxing". Where they
 take a regular telephone handset, strip the wires and attach alligator
 clips to the red and green wires. By hooking this device to a telecom TNI
 box, it is possible to use the phone services of a resident or business
 for toll-fraud purposes.

 If you talk to a switchman with Telus, they'll tell you that taking out
 power to the grid through the beige-boxing method is completely impossible.

 For one, power grid's are not even connected to the phone switches, and
 neither are systems that control runway lights at local airports. These
 systems are completely separate and are not even controlled by telecomm-
 unications switching equipment such as DMS-100's and GDA5's that Telus,
 the companies in the states such as Verizon Bell, Qwest, and Sprint use.

 Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers
 around the world have never had such systems in place where a phone switch
 is connected to critical infrastructure such as airports and power grids.
 Even in areas of the world where countries still use old Crossbar and Step-
 By-Step switching, beige boxing a TNI Box will give the same results; free
 telephone calls, nothing more.

 "Bilodeau, 37, said he's been involved with computer technology since
 grade school but has had little formal training. He's done some work for
 Microsoft and has written technology articles for The Journal, mostly
 video game reviews. As a prosecutor he's spent the last 11 years working
 in Edmonton, including two years at the Court of Appeal."

 - Somebody with so little formal security training and experience now has
 the ability to prosecute people for cyber-crimes - this really doesn't fit
 well in my stomach. Perhaps what Mr.Bilodeau should do is visit SANS.org
 and register for a formal information security course, or two, or three 
 before taking on the task as an Internet Crime Czar.

 Because if all Steve Bilodeau has for is experience is writing some video
 game reviews for the Edmonton Journal, non-cyber crime related court work,
 and unknown work with Microsoft, then what he has on his nicely shined
 resume isn't what I feel qualifies him to take on the tasks of finding
 criminals on the Internet. By coordinating with law-enforcement, security
 experts, and good intentioned hackers, tracking down online criminal
 activity on the 'net can be done with efficiency and integrity.

 Anonymous, thanks for your note.
 My article was intended to be a profile of the new prosecutor and not
 technical expose on the world of computer crime. That's probably a
 worthwhile subject for an article, but it wasn't what I set out to do.

  As for Mr. Bilodeau's qualifications, I can't really comment. Alberta
 Justice felt strongly enough to hire him.  I don't think he ever claimed
 to be a technical guru. His job title is prosecutor, meaning his primary
 area of expertise is the law surrounding computer crimes.

 As for the statistic quoted in the story, I got that from Mr. Bilodeau.
 There are likely several reputable organizations that have tried to measure
 the gross value of Internet fraud. I'm not sure why you think fraud.org's
 numbers are better than anyone else's. Perhaps I'll look into this a little
 further.

 Anyway, if you truly believe the figure quoted in the story is wrong, and if
 you believe the tale about the Massachusetts kid is false, then I suggest you
 also take these things up with Mr. Bilodeau. He works in the Special Prosecutions
 Branch for Alberta Justice. Hopefully you can track him down that way.

 I don't think it matters whether your intention was to profile a new
 prosecutor or not, because any real journalist would certainly try and
 do some research into a subject that they know nothing about.

 I suppose I should of remembered that mass media is a money and deadline
 driven industry where facts are irrelevant. Sensationalizing is what really
 sells newspapers, right Keith? Geez, this is worse than the garbage that
 the Edmonton Sun's Shane Holladay publishes. How embarrassing.

 By taking Steve Bilodeau's statements as 100% fact, you've shown that
 you're nothing more than a broadcaster who lacks any real journalistic
 integrity. If you were a real journalist you would have done your homework
 and actually discovered that many (if not all) of Mr.Bilodeu's statements
 are inaccurate.

 If you don't think that the numbers fraud.org indicated were accurate,
 then perhaps this whitepaper by the National White Collar Crime Centre
 and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be more to your liking:

 http://www1.ifccfbi.gov/strategy/IFCC_2001_AnnualReport.pdf

 You see with a little bit of research on a popular search engine such as
 Google, you'll see that even though the numbers on Internet fraud are
 often times different, they do not even come close to the one billion
 dollars that Steve claimed. Talk about blowing numbers out of proportion!

 And of course the TALE of the Massachusetts kid is false. I plan on
 contacting Steve Bilodeau personally to discuss where he got this
 so-called information, or if he did like a lot of people in his (and your)
 profession and simply made that all up. If you wish to contact Telus's
 Network Operations Centre directly, you're welcome to do that to verify
 if using a handset on a TNI box may cause the power to an entire grid
 to be knocked out including systems that control the runway lights
 at airports. Hit the 'ol 0 button on your touch tone phone.

 Don't worry, it won't cause you to launch a nuke against Iraq. ;-)

<tr33phr0g> well, gotta run... i'm off to do this uber-'leet exploit where i turn
my outside lights on and off in morse code sequence, which lets me take control of
the entire NS telephone system....
<tr33phr0g> no doubt i'll be prosecuted by Steven Bilodeau...
<tr33phr0g> anyone know any 12 year olds that wanna play my defense lawyer?

basically tell you to suck their cocks but while you're down there on your
knees don't forget next months payment. Motherfuck!

In this icy ghetto they've cooked up another layer to their ass-raping
insurance shenanigans, whereby if your car is more than 10 years old you have
to get a vehicle inspection by a mechanic. Now, this isn't to keep mechanically
dangerous vehicles off the road. Fuck no, that would make sense.
They'll still let you drive your piece-of-shit car on the road, you just
got to pay the insurance-pimp *more money*. What kind of racket is this?
Pay money to "save" money. Fuck that! Besides, my ghetto-ride won't pass any
mechanical safety inspection. Wouldn't it be nice to save $600 per year on
your car insurance without shelling out money or fixing up your ghetto ride?
Well of course it's fucking nice you ignorant eskimo, now here's how it is done.

                     Scam unto them as they scam unto us.

Using Micro$oft Word or some desktop publishing application (AOL Keyword
'warez'), create a nice form like the one below. Find a nice little clip-art
picture of a car on the net and use it as a logo. Grab the yellowpages and
pick some hillbilly garage in some buttfuck little town at the other end of
your province. Pick a phone number in the hillbilly towns prefix that isn't
even assigned and use that.

Experience shows that the insurance pigs don't even call the garage to verify
that they actually performed an inspection. Even if they do, you create
plausible deniability by picking a hillbilly garage that would likely
mishandle records, or not even keep records at all for this kind of stupid
shit.

Oh, and make all this shit look nice and professional, that means shit should
line up and there shouldn't be typos and shit. Learn how to use your
publishing warez properly with tables and all that jazz. Don't be a lazy
fucking bastard your whole life. Jesus christ.

Quick Tip: If you already have a vehicle inspection, scan that bitch in, fix
           it up proper, print it out and skip all that DTP shit. Yo, that
           means Desktop Publishing. Fucking grab a brain will ya?

Ok, now print it out (duh!), check off everything as being super-green, get
someone else to fill in the date and sign it illegibly (you don't want it to
match your hand-writing, duh!).

NOTE: The date you put on the inspection should be about 1-2 years ago. The
inspection is good for 5 years. Again, this is just to add to the plausible
deniability - just in case. Especially great if the date on the inspection is
before the date you purchased the car. If questioned you say the inspection
came with the car.

The "Mechanic's Certificate Number" appears to be either a 6 digit number or a
5 digit number followed by a letter. I can't really tell because hillbillys
don't can't print no good. So either do the fucking research and find out what
it's supposed to be, or just make some semi-legible ape-fisted scrawl in the
space provided. What the fuck do I care? It's your ass.

Also remember, you're not the only person who has read this file. If everybody
copies the form exactly as shown above the insurance agents may start noticing.
Mix it up a bit, be creative, and do a good job.

Ok, now photocopy it with some ghetto photocopier and put some creases in it
and grunge it up a bit like hillbillys have been handling it and like it's been
in your glovebox for a couple of years.

When it comes time to get a new vehicle inspection, just change insurance
companies and do it again.

Oh, a couple last things... If you are dumb, don't bother trying this. This is
fraud. Fraud is illegal. Will this even work? It has. Has anyone been caught
doing this? Not that I know of, but there's plenty of morons out there that
assuredly can / will / and do fuck this up. So don't.

Kankraka Presents....

"Borrowing" ADSL service for fun and (possibly) profit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is probably a pretty obvious thing to do, but I got inspiration from
the update on the beige box. What I figure, and will test soon enough, is
that, if you can use a beige box and "borrow" fone service off the
un-educated, why can't you use their broadband internet service too? will
test soon enough, is that This is what this file will tell you to do, and
you will listen, and you will like it. If you don't climb a fence with a
razor wire topping while naked and greased, and if you enjoy getting ripped
apart, well to hell with you.

Disclaimer:
~~~~~~~~~~~
This file is for entertainment/educational perposes only. If you choose to
use the information and get caught, don't even think of crying to me, I'll
just tell you sew your ass shut once you are imprisioned, it's for the best.
Theft of service is wrong/ilmoral/illegal so don't do it. Read past this
point and you've agreed to the above. Don't agree to my disclaimer, don't
read past this point and go fuck yourself.

Purpose of File:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Telus and Shaw run a monopoly, and anyone who managed to pass grade 6 knows
that monopoly's suck. We can't beat them, but we can cause them to spend
money or fix stuff that they shouldn't (in their minds) have to. Broadband
cost too much for us poor kids, so we must stick to the hell of dial-up,
which also costs too much money. (And if you have ever tried to download
games or long movies with dial-up, you know how big of an asset broadband
is.) Some of us poor kids have managed to get our hands on a laptop with an
ethernet card, and I'm going to tell you how to use this to your advantage.

What You Need:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- One laptop with a decent ether card, my friend suggested dragging his
desktop around, so I hit him. The more you have to carry, the bigger your
chances of being caught.
- A cable or adsl modem and extension coord. They may cost alot, but that
will pay for its self, at least if you use it enough. The extension cord
is for the modems power, I don't recommend the use of a battery pack
with expensive stuff.)
- The desire to commit crimes (most teennagers like me do, so no worries
there)
- And at least a little knowledge on tellco and cable boxes. (What? Are you
going to use the internet with your fridge??? Are you stupid???. You need
to know what to look for and how to use it for your advanatage.)

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Take your super duper laptop and modem and stick it in your packpack.
(Batteries must be fully charged. Or a few hours could turn into 20 minutes)
Walk, drive or whatever to a house that you know has the kind of service 
your modem will work with. (cable or adsl, ya dumbass.) A cable modem needs 
a cable box or splitter, I have a splitter on the side of my house, and one 
output isn't used so all you have to do is connect your modem. (do this at 
my house and I will kill you, I recently stepped into the world of cable net
for my PS2 gaming needs. It ssucks and I get disconnectyed every five 
minutes, ADSL is gunna be in in a week.) 

Once the adsl modem is connected, the lights on the front with blink a bunch.
This is called "training". A modem with a green "status" or "link" led lit 
indicates a modem "has train". This usually only takes between 10-30 seconds,
depending on many variables such as line loss, loop length, signal quality, 
modem, etc. In any case, I just wanted to give you a heads up on that.

Hide in some bushes or underneath something so your out of view. Now you just
savage their internet for your needs (packet sniff, hi-jack IPs, whatever you
want, they are the ones getting burned.)

With ADSL the setup is more or less the same, plug in modem, connect modem
to your laptop. Cut one end of the phone cord used for connecting modem to
phone line. Then separate the green and red wires, then strip them each
about an inch or so. Take the bare copper and wrap it around a paper clip,
one clip for the wires coming from the red wire and one clip for the green.
(you could just use alligator clips, but I'm to lazy to sodder any to fone
line.) After you do this, you must open the small grey box on the side of
the targets house and attach the paper clips to the screws that hold down
wires of the same colour. red to red, green to green. Now, I don't know much
about ADSL, but it should configure to there line's settings like a cable
modem would. Now you just do whatever you want online, download large files,
packet sniff and seize IP's, be a bastard. You can get away with it. But if
you don't want to then thats your own choice, I don't care. After it's all
hooked up, hide yourself where ever it's convenient for you, and hard to be
seen by others.

Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, I've shown you how to free yourself from the grip of dial-up for a few
hours, or if the family is on vacation, a few days (please stop to eat, food
is every hacker/phreakers friend. I recommend whipping out the beige and
ordering some Boston Pizza, and get a cabbie to pick you up some booze.)
Don't get caught, and don't squeal on those that you see doing it. And just
relax and have phun. And spread the word to all your friends that Telus and
Shaw can be beat, hell get a group of people to buy a modem and share it,
one day per person, or don't. Whatever. Hax0ring and Phr34king r00ls.

		Phrozen BloodFlame's Guide on How to get free AirMiles

03/10/03

Yes, it's my first file. 'Bout damn time, too, since I've been reading them for
about 8 years now. I finally have an exploit worthy of sharing! Yay! For BloodFlame!

<StandardDisclaimer>

This file is for informational purposes only. If you do this, and get into shit, it
is your own damn fault, cause I'm not going to be held responsible for your mistakes.

</StandardDisclaimer>



Now, if you live in Ontario, you have probably been to an A&P. If not, you're
probably asking "BloodFlame... what's an A&P?" Well, I'll tell you. An A&P is
a supermarket that is all over Ontario. I don't know about other provinces,
but apparently they are scarce to non-existent in Alberta.

"Wow, BloodFlame! You're 1337, cause you live in Ontario!"

Shut up. I'm trying to teach. In these supermarkets, there are change-counting machines.
These are usually located at the front of the store, on the way out. They are green,
about 6 feet high, and maybe 2 feet wide. They have a small TV screen on them, and a
couple of buttons. When you have a jar full of pennies and other small change, these
machines can be very useful, since you just dump the change into the machine, and it
counts it up, and spits out a coupon you can use right there, at that very store to
get groceries, cash, and AirMiles. The downside is that it takes something like 9.8
cents for every dollar in change. But who cares? We won't be putting in dollars!

			
		Here's the story, gather round, and listen, as
	       I tell a tale of terror, excitement, and comedy...


One day, Kay-Vyn, SpiderClone, Hangman's Joke and I were terrorizing the local 24 hour
supermarket (A&P), throwing pie plates around in a game of Ultimate, scratching ourselves
with the pasta forks (a BloodFlame trademark... always wash your pasta forks!), and the
like, we discovered a machine. A machine of great wonder, and mysterious powers. The
mysterious power to count change. K-rad! So, just for shits and giggles, I decided to
put in a penny, just to watch this machine in action, and learn a little bit more about
the world around me.

The machine had a start button, which I pushed, and the internal motor started churning.
The screen told me to put all my change on the tray, and filter it into the machine. So
I placed my penny (hey, I'm a poor mother canucker... whaddaya want?) on the tray, and
tilted it up. Then I pressed the "Done" button. The machine then gave me a coupon I could
use for a penny's worth of groceries, or a penny back from the till, and one AirMile.

I don't know how much you need to spend to get another AirMile, but I assume it's 10 bucks.
The thing is, the machine gives the AirMile for every 10 dollars, even the INCOMPLETE ten
dollars. This 0wns, because for a mere 3 dollars in pennies, and an hour of your time, you
can get a few packs of gum, plus three hundred AirMiles. Isn't that nice?

If the bitch behind the cash register complains tell her to eat a dick, cause it's 3 am,
and she's really got nothing better to do than to count all those coupons anyways. Give
the chick your AirMiles card (You don't have one? You dolt! Get one!) and tell her to
give you the full three hundred AirMiles. You've earned them, cause it'll prolly take
you somewhere around an hour to finish this off.

After you receive your reward, go to Florida, harass some old people, then laugh when they
have a heart attack while trying to beat you with their canes. (Yeah, I'm a mean bastard...
You got a problem with that? Didn't think so.)

"Wow, BloodFlame! You really ARE 1337!"

Yeah, I know. Now get out of my face, and go earn yourself a free trip to Florida.


Mad props go to theclone for inspiring me to write this file

wizbone for being the sexy beast he is

and to DayLightAssassin, for helping me to revive the CPU/CRU

					          reporting hardware error. The HW is
					          shown in the data field. If there is
					          no entry in the data field the error
					          is intermittent (i.e. phone coin jam).

 80	  Collection without clear	          Someone has collected the money without
					          clearing the running totals.

 82  	  Credit card hardware error	          Phone reports credit card reader problem.

 83	  Time out in Service Mode	          The payphone has had the service key
					          unlocked too long.

 84	  False incoming Call		          This is caused by the phone line in the
					          Modem ringing once and then stopping.

 85	  Non-Intellicall incoming call	          There is an incoming call detected by IFW,
					          but upon answer, no communications were
					          established. The call was probably not
					          placed by an Intellicall payphone.

 86	  Bad transmission for 3 incoming         3 attempts to communicate were unsuccessful.

 87	  N o IFW Response (no hybrid)		  Upon answering an incoming call, a four tone
						  herald was received but when a message was
						  sent there was no response. This sometimes
						  means that the hybrid is bad or missing.

 88	  Program RAM error			  An incoming call was received from a phone
						  which reports a bad program. An automatic
						  program download will begin if the program
						  file is available, as specified in the
						  download configuration.

 206	  Overdue billing records		  The billing records have been in the phone
						  beyond the requisite number of days specified
						  in the payphone's rate table.

 207	  Billing record area full		  The billing area cannot hold any further long
						  distance billing records. If this situation
						  occurs the payphone reverts to the AOS for
						  handling of long distance calls.

  		     INET Status Codes for Errors


  When IFW connects to a payphone and an error is present, IFW will log
  a 031 code in the Status Code field of the Trans.dbf. The Errbyte field
  will contain a number representing the error or errors that are currently
  detected in the payphone. The Errbyte field will continue to log this
  number for each command given by IFW until the error is corrected.


   Example:

 D  SERIAL  DATE	TIME	  CURTOT	 RUNTOTAL	RE	STA	  DWNLDFILE	RE	TRANS	ERRBY

 O  051234  06/27/1999	19:46:04   				02      031		00	00257	32768
 O  051234  06/27/1999	20:37:06   102.0000	 224.40		02	055		00	00257	32768
 O  051234  06/27/1999	20:37:07				02	067	  	00	00257	32768


 In the above example, when IFW connected to the payphone an error was detected and logged as 031,
 extended error (CDR full). The batch performed the commands in the group command. However, since
 the error still existed, the Errbyte field remains as 32768. The actual error can be found by
 examining the Supp.log file for a status code of 031. If you cannot find the error number in the
 Error Word Integer Table, it means it is a multiple error. You can use simple subtraction to find
 out what the multiple error is. (Usually done by an external program but can be done manually.)


 1. Find the nearest number from the table that's less than or equal to the
    error from the phone. Write down the error represented by this number.

 2. Subtract the number in the list from the error number received.

 3. Use the result of the subtraction to start over with step 1 again. For
    example, if the error number in question is 00024, the nearest number
    (less than or equal to) this error number is 16. This corresponds to
    Dime Slot Sensor Error. When you subtract 16 from 24, the result is 8.
    Code 00008 corresponds to Nickel Slot Sensor Error.

So i was talking to the phantom phreak. He was all schooling me on the ups
and downs of redboxing, little did he know canadian tones are different.

So i then proceeded to 3 way a loud test tone, then hes going off on that
tone all like 'o0o0o that sounded like the old 1000hz... no wait, 1004?
hey 3 way it again..' so he then proceeded to school me.

Said he had this doc(t1207) from 2000(current) and that it originally started
off as the Test Line Dictionary back in '89.

What follows is my one way conversation with the phantom phreak as he babbled
on and on about this test line dictionary.

It is kinda leet, good thing i record all my calls.

Defines types of terminating test lines and their operational functions,
provides numbering plan arrangements to access these capabilities for testing
across interconnections in the PSTN. Outlines in this standard applies to both
end user and network providers access to existing and proposed terminating test
lines from originating, intermediate and termianting points in the network.

This standard also described access to termianting test lines for exchange
carriers, ixc's, and CPE's such as PBX's, ISP's, etc. This standard does not
include originating control devices. General descriptions of test line types
are included in this standard since they link specific test access to test lines
that perform specific functions in a defines manner to ensure uniform operation
across network interfaces.

Introduction #
              ##################################################################
The trunk maintenance process ensures that trunks are accessible to traffic
function properly during call setup and termination providing a proper
transmission path during the call.

Trunk maintenance procedures may involve manual operations conducted from a
test position as well as a fully mechanized testing. In both instances, test
lines provide far end test termination functions.

Therefore, all service providers shall provide terminating test line access
as part of the basic plan for the overall maintenance of trunks. Terminating
test lines range in complexity from those that provide the relatively complex
function of recognizing and responding to specific signals.

All of the terminating test lines discussed in the following clauses can be
accessed (where appropriate) from the auto control devices, or manual test
positions, However, features that control the utilization of test lines may
be unique to each originating device.

The general descriptions of the test lines included as part of this standard
are operational descriptions. In no case should these operational descriptions
be considered as detailed design specs. In some cases, power levels, freq's,
and timing intervals are specified where they are considered to be critical
to the operation of the test line. Unless otherwise indicated, timing intervals
should be considered as minimums. In general, timing intervals can increase
by as much as 20%.


____________________________
Test Line Naming Conventions

When the North Americanm DDD(Direct Distance Dialing) Number Plan was first
formed, a need was recognized for routing codes to be assigned in tandem
offices to provide interoffice test line capability for trunk maintenance.

The NANP has reserved 10X(X=0-9) group of codes for this purpose. This
naming convention(10X) will be the standard in referencing the functions of
test lines that have 10X codes assigned to them. Test lines that do not
have 10X codes assigned to them will be referred by generic description
(ex, synchronous line). The 10X routing codes are reserved for
the termianting test lines in tandem offices.

_____________________________________
Terminating Test Line Classifications

Terminating test lines can be classified into three types; transmission test
lines, digital loop-back test lines and operational test lines. In general,
the terminating test lines have the following characteristics;

Operation:
Following seizure or ring-trip, off-hook supervision is normally provided
unless onhook supervision is the initial condition of the test sequence.
Following off hook sup(ervision), test lines that send tones provide a quiet
period(300ms) to permit the single frequency(SF) signalling units to change
sup status. In many cases, periods of onhook sup are applied at timed intervals
to facilitate taking down the connection once the originating end has disco'd.

Most test lines can be optioned to remove tone during these periods to ensure
proper SF signalling unit operation.

Supervision:
To provide supervision, test lines typically have supervisory control circuits
that may be in the transmission path. These control circuits are designed to
have a negligible effect on the transmision specs in the voice band.

Test line frequency:
The stated freqs of test line tones, as stated below, includes an additional
4 Hz above the nominal freq to avoid modulation by products that may be produced
in a PCM type carrier.

Transmission Test lines
100 type test lines are in use industry wide to facilitate connection to a
termination for balance and noise testing. There are 2 general versions of the
100 type test line. The early version provides only a quiet termination for
balance and noise testing. The later version, in addition to a quiet
termination, also provides a 1004hz tone for one way loss measurements.

 Quiet Termination
 The quiet termination consists of 900 or 600 ohms(depending on office
 impedance) in series with a 2.16 microfarad capacitor. In some cases, this
 termiantion is built out to the nominal office capacitance with a build out
 capacitor. Exceptions include;

  In 4 wire analog offices, the quiet termination is a 4 wire 600 ohm
  termination.

  In digital offices, the office provides a termination to idle code that is the
  equivelant of an analog 600 ohm, 4 wire quiet termination.

  Some offices have 2 versions of quiet termination. The older ver consists of a
  900 ohm resistor in series with a 2.16mf capacitor as described above. The
  newer ver is more complex with 2 states, tandem and local.

   The tandem state provides a termination consisting of an 887 ohm resistor in
   series with a 2.16mf cap. In some cases, this termination may be built out to
   the equivelant of 400ft of office cabling(junctor grouping frame to the
   termination) with a build out resistor and build out cap.

   The local state provides complex impedance designed to simulate a typical
   local loop. In some cases the termination may be built out to the equivalant
   of 400 feet of office cable.


______________________________
1000hz milliwatt(mw) test tone

Frequency. Several versions of mw tone supplies exist. The older unmodified
version provides a 100hz +/- 10hz tone, the newer, modified ver provides a
1004hz +/- 1hz tone.

Level. These tones are adjusted to 0.0dBm +/- 0.03dBm(for switching offices with
0dB test access loss), 2.0dBm +/- 0.03dBm(for switching offices with 2dB test
access loss), and 3.0dBm +/-0.03dBm (for switching offices with 3dB test access
loss). The level of the tone is measured at the center of the switching
machine.
(ex, at the trunk or line distro frame or at the junctor grouping frame)

Impedance. The nominal impedance of the tone source is either 600 or 900 ohms,
depending on the nominal impedance of the office.

EXCEPTIONS. Digital Offices may provide;
A 0.0dBm0, synthesized, 1004hz digital encoded signal, or,

A 0.0dBm0, synthesized, 1013.8hz, 797byte sinewave, digitally encoded
reference signal(DRS) that provides a sine wave for analog testing and a
specific digital sequence for bit error ratio testing(BER).


Operational Parameters

The minimum capabilities of the 100 type test lines provide only a quiet
termination. Upon seizure of the test line, the operational sequences are as
follows: Off hook(answer) supervision is returned and quiet termination is
places across circuit. Some test lines return a short interval(approx 1 sec) of
onhook disconnect sup every 11secs, starting approx 11seconds after the initial
connection.

The preferred 100 type test lines provide a 1004hz tone followed by a quiet
termination. Upon seizure of the test line the operational sequences are as
follows; Offhook(answer) sup is returned. After approx 300ms delay(min 200) a
1004hz tone is applied for approx 5.5secs. After the tone is disco'd, a quiet
termination is applied til the caller disco's.

Certain 100 type test lines may return a 1, 2, or 3second onhook disconnect
signal approx 11seconds after the quiet termination has been applied. Others
may return a series of 1, 2 or 3 second on hook disconnect signals approx
every 30 seconds after the quiet term has ben applied.


_________________________________
101 type test line-communications

The communications test line provides a circuit into a test board or test
position that can be reached over any trunk incoming to the switching system
served by that test position. It is used for reporting troubles and making two
person manual trunk tests from test positions.


_____________________________
102 type test line -Milliwatt

The milliwatt test line provides a 1004hz tone for one way loss measurements.
The features of this termination are as follows.

 Transmission paramters; 1004hz tone

Level. These tones are adjusted to 0.0dBm +/- 0.03dBm(for switching offices wiht
0-dB test access loss), 2.0dBm +/- 0.03dBm(for switching offices with 2dB test
access loss), and 3.0dBm +/-0.03dBm (for switching offices with 3dB test access
loss). The level of the tone is measured at the center of the switching
machine. (ex, at the trunk or line distro frame or at the junctor grouping frame)

Impedance. The nominal impedance of the tone source is either 600 or 900 ohms,
depending on the nominal impedance of the office.

EXCEPTIONS. Digital Offices may provide;
A 0.0dBm0, synthesized, 1004hz digital encoded signal.

 Operatonal Paramters

Upon seizure of the test line, the operational sequences are as follows;
 Off hook (answer) sup is returned.

 After a delay of approx 300ms a 1004hz tone is applied, note; one version may
 be optioned for a 175ms delay.

 The test line may be installed to provide, at regular intervals ranging between
 9 and 12 seconds, a 1,2, or 3second interval. Note that one version may be
 optioned for a 2sec interuption every 2min.


____________________________________________________________
104 type test line-transmission measuring and noise checking


Transmission measuring and noise checking(test line) provides a test termination
for two way transmission testing and a near end noise measurement and far end
noise check. This termination may be used to test trunks from offices equipped
with automatic trunk test frames. It may also be used for manual one person two
way transmission measurements from a test position.


The 104 type test termination;

Provides test pads as required by the office in which  it is located. In order
to ensure consistent and symmetrical measurement when testing across network
interfaces, both EX and IC tandem digital switch test lines should be arranged
such that a digital reference signal is decoded to a -6dBm test level points.

Provides offhook supervision.

Measured the 1004h loss of the trunk from the originating end to the far end.

Adjusts a transmitting(tx) pad to equal the trunk loff measured. if this loss
exceeds 10db the tx'ing pad value is reduced by 10db subsequent TPT equals 225hz
+/- 5hz at -10dbm +/- 0.5dbm) signal indicated this fact to the originating end.

Performs two self checks to determine if the pad has been properly adjusted. In
case of failure in either of these checks a repetition of the measurement is
requested.

Applies 1004hz test tone (0dbm) directly to the trunk to permit a rx'ing
measurement at the originating end.

After a timed interval, sends 1004hz test tone (0dbm) through the tx'ing pad
adjusted in the fourth bullet above, preveded by a TPT signal if it had been
reduced by 10 dB.

The difference between the levels of the two tones rx'ed at the originating end
(adjusted by 10 db if necessary) equates to the loss measured.

A quit termination is provided for 5 seconds so that a noise measurement can be
made at the originating end, and at the same time, a noise measurement is made
at the test termination.If the noise exceeds the threshold(41 dBmC), an
alternating on and off TPT disconnect signal is returned. Otherwise a steady
onhook signal is returned.


___________________________________________________
105 type test line-automatic transmission measuring

The automatic tx measuring test line provides far end access to a responder and
permitys 2 way loss and noise measurement to be made on trunks from a near end
office equipped with a remote office test line(ROTL) and responder or other
suitable control device. A number of 105 type test lines may be associated with
one common responder. The test lines provide a queuing mech for callz awaiting
connection to the responder.

The near end ROTL and responder may be controlled by an automated test system or
a manually operated ROTL unit. humph. In an integrated responder unit, the 105
type test line performs the responder functions in addition to its normal
funmctions.

The calls in auque are serves one at a time on a cyclical basis in the order in
which they were recieved. boohyeah, as each call from a 105 type test line is
connected, the test line provides the proper supervision and impedance
conversion between the trunks to be tested and the responder.

Queuing delay could be upto several minutes. These test lines provide
indications to the responder regarding the impedance at which the measurement is
to be made (600 to 900 ohms) and the test access loss to be applioed (ex, 0-,
2-, or 3-dB). In order to ensure consistent and symmetrical measurement when
testing across network interfaces, both the EC and IC tandem digital switch test
lines shoiuld be arranged such that a digital reference signal is decoded to a
- 6- dbm test level point.

When the 105 type test line is seized, an off hook sup signal (min 300ms)
followed by a test progress tone is returned to the originating office. (test
progress tone equals 2225hz +/- 25hz at -10dbm +/- 0.5dbm)

If the responder is idle, the quieing circuit connects the test line to the
responder after a min of 900ms of TPT. When the responder is attached or the
control device disco's, the TPT is removed. If the responder is busy, or other
test lines in queue have already been seized or both conditions apply, the TPT
continues to be send back to the originating end to indicate that the call is in
queue and is awaiting cut through to the responder. When the access circuit in
queue has progressed to the test line under consideration, the test line is cut
through and the TPT is removed.

Prior to connecting to a responder, the 105type test line requires two or three
timing intervals depending upon the type of trunks being served. These timing
intervals are provided by a timing circuit incorporated into the test line.

The first timing itnerval of 150ms is required in some offices to allow the
switching sys to perform continuity tests prior to cut through. The second
timing interval of 150 ms is required to allow SF signalling units to stabalize.

All 105 tye test lines provide the third timing interval, which is a min 900ms.
A TPT is returned to the orig end indicating that a test line has been seized.
IF at the end of this third timing period, the 105 type test line has not seized
a responder, the TPT remains on the line till the connecton is made or til the
originating end releases the connection.

After the testing sequence has been completed, the responder signals the 105
type test line to release. A just released 105 type test line remains connected
to the trink till the originating trunk disco's or till the office time out
feature kicks in.

In end offices using 105 type test lines, the line also returns an onhookm
signal to the orig office,. When the teastline has been released from the truck
is restores idle state, hungry for more.

Reponders.

Several types of responders exist. The 51B type can be used in conjunction with
the 105 type test line and is capable of making 2 way loss and noise
measurements. However, these responders are no longer being manufactured.

The 52 type responder provides additional testing capability as outlined below.
The 56A type responder is designed for small EOs, community dial offices, and
PBXens. The responder testing capabilities are as follows;

51B Type responder; Loss, C-Message noise

52 type responder; Loss, C-Message noise, C-notched noise, 3tone(gain) slope,
                    return loss(balance), measure and terminated '3card option')

56A type Mini responder; Loss, C-message+notched noise, 3tone gain slope,
                        balance loss, terminate only.

RTTU(remote trunk test unit) responder; all 52 type capabilites. Balance
                                        measurement and termination.


Remote Measurement System - Digital responder (RMS-D)
Provided in digital switching offices. Updated to employ DSP tech, all 52 type
capabilities included. Batteries sold seperately. Auto echo canceler tester.

Note; the 56A mini responder provides an additional manual sequence in which one
way(far to near) measurements of loss, gain slope, and C message noise can be
made by personnel at the near end. The mini responder combines the functions of
a single 105 type line and responder.


______________________________________________
107 type test line-data transmission test line

The data transmission test line provides connection to a signal source that
generates test signals for one way testing of data and voice transmission
parameters. The test line supplies a peak to average (P/AR) signal, gain slope
freqs, quiet termination, and intermodulation distortion test signals.

The test line also allows measurement of return loss, freq shift, phase jitter,
C notched noise, impulse noise, gain hits, phase hits, and dropouts. x|

The P/AR signal, having a spectrum similar to many high speed data sets, permits
a repid check of the quality of a facility for data tx'ing. The P/AR signal is
particularly sensitice to the envelope delay distortion. The 3 tone sloper freqs
(1004, 404, and 2804hz) at -16dBm0 permit measurement of the trunk freq
characteristic. A 1004hz -16dBm0 tone permits measurement of freq shift, phase
jitter, C notched noise, impulse noise, gain hits, phase hits, and dropouts.


___________________________________
109 Test line echo canceler testing

The echo canceler test line provides loop back arrangements for in service
testinf of far end echo cancelers.

Upon access the test line returns offhook sup and, after a 2sec delay, returns
tha 1004hz tone at -10dbm0 for approx 8sec. After an onhook flash, a connection
is made to a quier termination. Measurement made at the near end with a return
loss measuring set (RLMS) should indicate a very high reading for this
condition.

After approx 16sec another onhook flash is followed by a 16 second interval in
which the trunk is looped back with no attenuation. The RLMS should show a very
low reading since most echo cancelers cannot function with less then 6dB of
return loss.

And then, after the 3rd on hook flash, the trunk is looped through a 10dB pad
for 16 seconds. The echo canceler should now function and a high level of return
loss will be measured. The near end canceler has no effect on these tests and
must be checked with a similar test performed with the functions reversed at the
far end.

At any time after the first interval of 1004 hz tone has started, a ring
forward(rering) signal will cause all timing to stop in the test line. Each
subsequent ring forward signal will cause the line to advance to the next state.
The four stop sequence tone followed by the 3 loop back conditions is repeated
till disco, wether the test line is timed or manually controlled.


____________________________
Digital loop back test lines

108 type test line - digital non inverting loop back

The noninverting loop back test line provides for digital testing capabilities
between digital exchange/digital PBXs or both. The digi loop back test like
provides a dialable, 4 wire test line capability, which consists of circuitry
that accepts and loops back recieved octets, which are re-tx'ed so that the
positions of the bits within the octets are preserved.

This means that the most significant bit of the re-tx'ed octet corresponds to
the most significant bit of the rx'ed octet. The 108 type test line provides for
a noninverting loop back test line capable of passing 64kbit/s clear signals.

In this manner, all digi services(ex, 56kbit/s, 64kbit/s Restricted, and
64kbit/s Clear) can pass digi test signals through this test line. The 108 can
also support loop backs for calls at any n by x DSO rate, where 1 < n < the
number of channels in the primary rate(24 in the north american digital
hierarchy, or 30 euro).

The digital loop back test line may be integrated into the switching
network(preferred implementation in a digital switching sys) or may be provided
in a stand alone config similar to some existing test lines. Aswell, digitally
encoded analog test signals can be passed through this test line.

Refer to t1.206 for more information on this test line.


________________________________________________
606 type test line - digital inverting loop back

The digital loop back inverting test line provides operational and digi testing
capability for switched digital trunks originating or terminating into 2 wire
offices. This line is used for diagnostic (routine+demand) tests of digital
trunks.

A loop back is provided with circuitry to alter the rx'ed bit stream before
transmission. The bit stream must be inverted to prevent errors due to
reflections from a hybrid in the 2 wire analog switch maintenance circuit.

Maintenance techs perform manual tests on digi exchange trunks in the loop back
mode. A single maintenance tech can perform a loop back test by originating a
data test call to the test line. The data test call number assigned is
959 6060.

After the test call has been setup to this test line, the tech will use a test
set to perform digital tests. No 10X code is available for this test line.


______________________
Operational Test lines

103 type test line - signal supervisory testing

The signal supervisory test line provides a connection to a supervisory and
signalling test circuit for overall testing of these features on inter toll
trunks equipped with ring forward features that can be reached by an automatic
trunk test frame or by dialing manually. The features of the 103 include;

On seizure, the test line returns an off hook signal.
On receipt of a ring forward signal, the test line returns an onhook signal.
On receipt of a second ring forward signal, the test line returnms a 120 IPM
flash.


____________________________________________
Synchronous test line - no 10X code assigned

Synchronous test lines are required for offices(usually in connection with x bar
offices) where ring, trip, and sup features are in the incoming trunk relay
equipment. Marginal tests of the sup and trip functions are provided.

Tests may be originated on either a manual or auto basis. In Stored Porgram
Control(SPC) offices, an equivelant program controlled test line operation is
provided to satisfy the requirements of the originating office test frames.

All synchronous test lines utilize a 7 digit code to access test lines. The test
line is required to perform the following functions;

 Tests for application of the ring signal and return audible ringing tones for
 approx 2 sec followed by a 3 to 4 sec silent interval.

 Tests for pretrip of machine ringing during silent interval.

 Provides a 120IPM tone till disconnect, if pretrip fails. If pass, then a test
 for tripping the machine ringing is performed during the same 3 to 4 sec silent
 interval. If the trip test fails, the 2sec audible ring and the 3 to 4 second
 silent interval are returned till disconnection. The pretrip and trip tests are
 performed in seperate silent intervals by some versions of test lines. In
 certain tandem versions, a single 2 second interval of TPT is applied instead
 of the initial 2 second 120IPM tone.

When reringing successfully trips, the following supervisory tests are provided:

 An offhook signal of approx 1.3 secs for synchronzing with automatic
 progression test equipment in originating offices is returned. During the
 offhook period, soak current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .2 sec on hook supervision; release current is applied to sup circuit.

 Return .3 sec off hook sup; soak current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .2 second onhook sup; release current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .3 sec off hook sup; soak current applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .2 sec on hook sup; release current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return 1.3 sec off hook sup; operate current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .2 sec on hook sup; an open circuit condition is present to sup circuit.

 Return .3 sec offhook sup; operate current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .2 sec on hook sup; an open current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return .3 sec off hook sup; operate current is applied to the sup circuit.

 Return continuous onhook sup and provide audible signal. An audible interrupted
 signal may be applied at a rate of 120IPM which may consist of interrupted dial
 tone, test progress tone, or high tone.

NOTE; one test line circuit returns off hook sup during this stage. Soem test
lines provide a Centrex Treansfer test capability during this stage.


_________________________________________________
Nonsynchronous test line - step by step test line

A nonsynchronous test line provides an operational test which is not as complete
as the sync test but can be made more rapidly. The nonsync test line is the only
type required for eletromechanical offices where marginal type tests cannot be
applied directly to the incoming trunk circuit, as is frequently the case with
steppers.

In some instances, connector test terminations can be used to apply marginal
tests to such circuits as toll transmission selectors. All nonsync test lines
utilize a seven digit test line code for access. The minimum requirements for
non sync test lines look like this;

 Starts to function under the control of the ringing signal

 Permits the audible ringing signal to be returned for a min .5 sec to the
 originating office.

 Causes ringing to trip

 After the ringing has been tripped, it returns the 60 IPM line busy signal
 which consists of alternate .5 second off and on hook signals with low tone
 applied during each offhook period till it is disconnected.

The nonsync test line, used in many step by step offices for the application of
marginal tests when applied to connector circuits, operates in the following
manner;

 Starts to function under the control of the ringing signal

 Permits the audible ringing signal to be returned for 1 to 1.5 seconds

 Returns an initial offhook signal of 1 to 1.5 secs during which time ringing is
 tripped.

Provides the following sup signals sequentially after the initial off hook
tests are applied;

 0.5 sec onhook
 1 to 1.5 sec offhook
 .2 sec onhook
 .3 sec offhook
 .2 sec onhook
 .3 sec onhook
 .2 sec onhook
 .3 second offhook
 A 2 second onhook period to permit disconnection from the test line.

Alternate 5.5 second offhook and 2 second onhook intervals are repeated untill
disconnection. The first two 5.5 second intervals are provided to facilitate
testing of the ring forward(rering) and control features provided on some
operator selected trunks to end offices and are desirable where these features
are provided.

Test line access methodology #
                              ##################################################
This final section describes a test line numbering plan for cases 1 through 8,
as shown in the above matrix. TO locate the appropriate test numbering plan
case, use the ASCII chart by identifying the terminating test line application
in the vertical column and then selecting the originating test application in
the horizontal row.

ex; a test connection terminating to an EO(vertical columb) and originating from
an IC tandem(horizontal row) would be test numbering plan case 6.

This numbering plan uses variables;

        T = Identifies type of test line (0-9)
        W = 0 or 1
        Y = 8 or 9
        N = 2 to 9
        X = 0 to 9
        D = Dunt give a fuck(filler digit)

The numbering plans for these cases may contain a preferred scheme that provides
a recognizable test line pattern. The pattern is based on the 10X codes
associated with test lines.

One objective in the standard is to allow for availability of locally assigned
numbers. In those cases where the preferred and allowed schemes cannot be
provided, the default option is provided.(results may vary)

Operational test line access methodology

The numbering plans for synchronous end office test #s, synchronous IC and EC
tandem test numbers, and nonsynchronous(SXS type) are outlined below;

 Synchronous EO test # NXX-XXXX

 Synchronout IC and EC tandem test numbers are 959-1530 or 96Y-XXXX. The non
 synchronous(SXS) type is numbered NXX-XXXX.

______
Case 1
Applies CPE line or trunk access to CPE terminating test lines:

NXX-X10T Preferred
NXX-XX0T Allowed
NXX-XXXX Default

______
Case 2
Applies to CPE line or trunk access to EO terminating test lines:

NXX-X10T Preferred
NXX-XXXX Allowed

______
Case 3
Applies to interstate outwats line access to serving EO terminating test lines:

95Y-X10T Preferred
95Y-XXXX Allowed

______
Case 4
Applies to CPE line access to an ICT. This case provides for a built up
connection from a subscriber line through an end office, either through an EC
access tandem to the IC switch, or direct from the EO to the IC switch.

700-95Y-10TD Preferred
700 95Y-11WT

______
Case 5
Applies to an EC end office or ICT to CPE trunk. The NXX and thousands digit are
those assigned for normal traffic.

NXX-X10T Preferred
NXX-XX0T Allowed
NXX-XXX  Default

______
Case 6
Applies to an originating network switch, terminating to an EO. This case is
intended for intraLATA connections, where no intermediate switch is involded in
the connection.

NXX-X10T Preferred
NXX-XX0T Allowed
NXX-XXX Default

______
Case 7
Applies to an originating network switch, terminating to an EC or IC tandem.
(EO to IC tandem is via direct trunking, not EC tandem)

10T      Preferred
95Y-10TD Allowed
95Y-11WT Allowed

Note; the 10T code has traditionally been used to route a call in a combined
local tandem office to the tandem test line termination. If the 7 digit code is
used for this purpose, different numbers must be used to differentiate between
local and tandem terminations.

______
Case 8
Applies to a network terminating to OSPS/TOPS
95Y-12TD

Note; The 95Y dialing code as outlined is restricted to interstate outwats lines
in end offices only.

 "Aquiring satellite signal, please wait..."

Story I heard from close collegue of mine that works at a major call center
in canada (tech support in satellite tv) so as the story goes... One night
03/13/2003 business as usual, but (major but) around 5:00pm est there was a
problem, when a CSR (customer service representitive) would answer the phone,
at company ...(thank you for calling Bell express Vu, my name is bob
how can I help you?) at the same time a CSR from the competitors would also
answer saying ...(thank you for calling starchoice, my name is jane how can
i help you?) at this point, the customer that dialed the 1-800 number for
his satellite provider would get two representitives, one from each company!

Also put to my attention was that every call coming thru was on the famous
'0' queue, hence, the people who don't take the fucking time to go thru the
options to get on the right path to getting help with the proper department,
they just smash zero, hear a voice and start barking at the CSR cause they
too stupid to work the hi-tech remote to buy some porn at 3:00 in the after-
noon on pay-per-view, or they got cut off after four months of not paying
their bill (damn welfare case).

Well... when I heard this, first a laughed, then I got him to do a little
research, first I asked him for a small list of all the prefixes of the
calls that were doing the strange cross lined thingy, well I was very lucky
cause he got me a list from the telephone admin that flaged every fucked
call that came in the '0' queue. Here are the prefixes affected:

area codes: 416 & 514

336, 337, 338, 339, 426, 428, 429, 457, 473, 475, 630, 693, 694
695, 697, 699, 782, 783, 903, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, and 884.


If you notice anything, those are all telus cell prefixes in Ontario and
Quebec... so I laughed a little more. Now it's not that I didn't believe
him but I wanted to confirm all this, so I took the liberty to verify myself
and I called Starchoice. I said I was Paul Jones with Johnson Security, and I
was hired by Telus Mobility to investigate the problem on 03/13/2003. First I
got a CSR answer thank you for blah, blah blah... asked to be transferred to a
director, cause it was saturday, no one was in but a lowly supervisor, ask if
he could confirm the problem, first it was no, then I said; "I'll just put
you on hold to call telus and verify..." and I had a coffee and smoke, I came
back and he mystically had an answer. He confirmed that yes they had the same
problem, but did not want to confirm the prefixes over the phone. He wanted
contact info at this point to call me back, (fuck that!) so I said that because
I'm on contract with Telus, they would have to talk to them directly, then they
would send me a memo... ha! Well then a said thanks and quickly ended the call.

So TO END the story, they haven't had the problem since. I wish I had some
kind of tech follow-up to add on why this happened, but sorry to say, I don't.

It's probably some error at the switch (cell CO), and since all the calls were
coming in through the '0' queue, it was probably easy to set up as both companies
have that same queuing system (I checked). If anybody wants to add to this story
like a valid explanation, all the power to you...

Hope you enjoyed it!
