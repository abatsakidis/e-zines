 	 K-1ine Interview with Azriel from Comatose Rose Magazine

 It is my pleasure to introduce you to Azriel J. Knight from Comatose Rose -
 Canada's only Gothic Print Magazine. This interview was conducted via e-mail
 on Thursday January 9, 2003 by The Clone of K-1ine 'zine / Nettwerked.net. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 The Clone: How and when did Comatose Rose Magazine come into existence,
            and where do you see it in a couple years?

 Azriel: Sure, start with the hard one :P Comatose Rose Magazine has gone
	 through many incarnations over the last four years. But the print
	 version has been around for the last year. How did it start? Well,
	 music has always been my first passion, and I was beginning to expose
	 myself to a lot of wonderful underground music. Gothic, industrial,
	 EBM and the like. I wanted to share the music I found, with others.

 The Clone: If people want to pick up a copy of your zine, they can go to your
	    web site and find locations, but what if someone doesn't have Comatose
	    Rose in their community? Is there a way to get a copy of it online?

 Azriel: There is a locations section on the web site that is live, that is to say
	 that we will scratch off the location once they have run out of copies, so
	 you won't go home empty handed. Depending where the magazine is being held,
	 there is an optional donation, but most places it's free. If you're outside
	 of the locations, then you can send me a money order or buy a copy with any
     	 major credit card.

 The Clone: The gothic scene is much like the hacker / phreaker scene in a lot of ways
	    - both started and exist in the 'underground';your scene focuses a lot on
	    music and our scene focuses a lot on technology. What are your thoughts on
	    hackers and phreakers, and are you at all surprised that we have so many
	    hackers & phreakers who are also involved the gothic scene?

 Azriel: I am not at all surprised. My scene is going through a major transition, and
	 has been for the last few years. Basically a lot more bands are using a lot
	 more synth work in their music. Gothic as we once knew it in the mid to late
	 eighties is long dead, sure some bands still play the old flavor, but electr-
	 onics is simply the way things are going. My thought on hackers and phreakers?
	 It's quite fascinating, I think the government should stop arresting you guys
	 and start hiring you for work. I hate getting viruses in the mail, which I do
	 all the time, but I know those are not "real" hackers, so no worries.


 The Clone: What would your first pieces of advice be for anyone (in Canada, the United
	    States, and International) looking to start their own gothic print magazine?
	    And do you welcome "partnerships" between other 'zines? (I might be interested,
	    hehe).

 Azriel: Establish yourself as an online magazine first, make friends with people in the
	 business, and work your way up. Don't let up, don't be lazy, and avoid frustration.
	 Partnerships are easy with Comatose Rose. We have a page rental program, it's costs
	 less than advertising because you're adding content to the magazine. Anyone can do
	 it, as long as your writing fits the magazine and we like it.


 The Clone: If someone with special talents (such as writing, graphic design, and marketing)
	    wanted to help out Comatose Rose, how would they go about contacting you and your
	    staff?

 Azriel: Anything involving that can be brought to my direct attention, just e-mail me at
	 azriel@comatoserose.com. What really catches my attention is people who are just
         themselves, but are straight forward in what they want to do for Comatose Rose.
	 Don't send me an e-mail with an overdose of big words to try and sound all fancy,
	 I won't be impressed, especially when you forget to run the damn thing through a
	 spell check (it has happened).


 The Clone: Azriel, what are your staff's plans for the upcoming (5th) issue of Comatose Rose
            Magazine?

 Azriel: We have lots of great stuff planned. Issue #5 will be released on Valentine’s Day and
	 will feature interviews with Covenant, Mortiis, Assemblage 23, Sam Rosenthal, Z Prochek
	 and more. Scene reports from Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto. A rant or two, 30 album
	 reviews, the list goes on.

   	
  Thank you, Azriel.

With the outbreak of DSL, more and more people are giving up their dial-up 
connections for it. So with this in mind you need to update your beige 
box. When you subscribe to DSL, a high frequency data signal is sent 
through your line on the same pair as your current voice service resides.

DSL service requires special filters on the customer premise for a voice 
line and DSL service to coexist happily on the same pair. If you dont plan 
on climbing into someone's home to connect your beige box to their filter, 
you will hear a constant "beep........beep...boop" in the line. This makes 
conversations difficult.

A few notes on DSL

-DSL does not require voice service to operate. Just a copper pair. 
However, Telus, being the gestapo-esque corporation they are, has a policy 
of "no voice service, no dsl!" This is a good way to ensure people will 
keep landlines which are growing useless with the advent of cheap (:P) 
wireless (cancellular) service.

-Most DSL lines are run off of fax lines. 

-There are two types of filters available for DSL: POTS splitters, and 
inline-filters. 


The inline filters are a simple box with an rj11 port on one end, and a 
short (2-3") cord with an rj11 crystal on the other. This type of filter 
is only for voice. For example, you get DSL on your fax line so you plug 
your DSL mowdun (stands for mow-dalawn dun-dalawn) into the phone line, 
and your fax (aka "PH4CKS") into the inline filter, and then into the 
line. 

The only possible downfall of these types of filters is that the voice can 
potentially cause a small amount of interference with the DSL connection, 
but unless you have a terrible line, or a long run from your CO, you won't 
notice. 

                            /

                                     \----[DSL mowdun]



The POTS splitter usually has three ports: 

1. LINE, LINE-IN, or POTS -- This is where the phone line comes IN to the 
pots splitter. (POTS stands for Plain Old Telephone Service... I didn't 
name this shit, don't blame me). 

2. PHONE -- This is where the voice channel is split out to. duh. 

3. MODEM, DSL -- The mowdun is plugged in through this port. Everything 
but DSL signals is filtered through this port. No voice.

                           /

                                           [___________]




The POTS splitter has it's advantages because it can be installed at the 
Demarc and doesn't require any extra ugly filters to hang out of your wall 
jacks. There's also the aforementioned potential for interference with the 
inline filters. 

Probably for the beige box, the inline filter would be ideal and very 
simple to modify for beiging use while a POTS filter would be alot more 
trouble to splice in properly.

Plug your BB into the filter and then splice the filter onto the pair upon 
which the DSL service resides. Your beige box will still work with out the 
in-line filter, but it will be harder to successfully social engineer your 
targets, especially operators with all that line noise.

But remember kids, beiging on private phone lines without prior permission 
is against the law, and soon reading this article will also be against the 
law. So be careful, and remember, only YOU can prevent forest fires.

	Fun things to do with DSL in a local Bell monopoly


Notice : I'm not responsible for anything stupid you do with this

Well first off we all know that Bell sucks and because they were forced to upon up
their lines to other companies they screwed up even more than they would have. Basically
how everything works: Your phone line is hooked into a DSL slam providing you dsl access.

Depending on the type of service you have (1.0, 1.2 , 1.5 , 3.0 , 3.5) this is where the
cap is place (remember this its important later). Now when you want to connect to DSL you
have to run PPPoE and stick in your user name and password so that it knows which ISP to
route your connection to. What this means is that if you have a 3mb line from some cheap
company which gives you very little bandwidth and you have a friend who has a cheap 1.2
line with some one who has unlimited bandwidth (Primus) you can get unlimited bandwidth
on your 3mb line by using their user name and password - in most cases.

When you connect authentication is handled by looking at the @ sign in your user name and
forwarding you to the owner of that networks radius authentication server. Each radius
authentication server handles you differently; Bell will allow three simultaneous connec-
tions under the same account, Primus 3 to 4, Trytel 1 to 2 (if you know about other ones
I'll add them).

Some more interesting stuff can be accomplished with linux by taking the user names and pass-
words of all of your friends on different networks and connecting to multiple networks; set
the default gw to whoever has the cheapest bandwidth; and add static routes so that anything
directly connected on the networks that your connected to will go through their connection
(very good for P2P and other stuff). I'm thinking of writing a perl script which will take a
look at your connections and try connecting through each network and determining the fastest
way (normally you could use routing information but its highly unlikely you can convince them
to send you routing updates - even if you could it would probably tip them off).

.......................,
What is closet hacking?:
.......................:

Closet hacking is the act of personal computing within a closet.
A terminal can be fit inside a closet, be it just the monitor(s)
and keyboard(s),or the entire setup with subwoofer and all,closet
hacking should appeal to some people. Here are some reasons why:

-Stealth/Security , if you are evading someone, chances are they
 won't look in the closet. In a raid, when you hear "ROOM CLEAR"
 wait until no one is in the room and book out the window hoping
 the place isn't surrounded, or that you can escape it by running
 like hell.

-Closets hot box perfectly.(black lighting should be installed)

-In some cases, there is room for multiple hackers, or systems.
 (rack mounting on the overhead shelf if applicable)

-Fun. It is like the clubhouse you never had.

-Good for local multiplayer gaming, ensures no cheating.

The purpose of closet hacking is to create an enjoyable, and in
some cases, an effecient computing experience. For me it's the
way my sub rumbles the closet walls, and the inability to see my
monitor though the smoke that makes closet hacking so appealing.

...........................,
Why become a closet hacker?:
...........................:

If the above section leaves you still asking this question then
piss up a rope. Fuckin clausi.

.............,
Closet Setups:
.............:

My closet is portable, basically its a big wooden box:

    __________________

So with the front wall/door removed,
it looks something like this (kinda):

This set up allows me extended comfort for long term use, and use of multiple
monitors. I spent New Years eve/day in my closet, only problem was my monitor
lost alance atop my case and fell as I was exiting.

In this scenario, this was the only time my old school logitech wireless
keyboard shined! It's not bulky like the new ones with Internet keys and shit,
so it worked good. The only thing I didn't like is the monitor being so close
to my eyes as my closet is rather small. Luckily it has a zoom-out function;
LCD/laptop monitor use would be optimal.

There was still room for various paraphernalia, and a telephone.

In a really small closet, the CPU could be outside the closet concealed.
Wireless tech could be used for networking. A low-cost fix would be to use 
infrared. Transmitters and reciever plans are readily available on the net.
For most effecient use, you should completely clear out your closet, and
experiment with different set ups and seeing what works best for you.

Some things to keep in mind: excessive heat - you may want to outfit your
computer with an airflow package with air filters. If you have a nice hot box 
going and don't want to break it, you should stock bottled beverages. 

NOTE: beer bottles make poor urinals. They don't hold as much as you may think
they do. Learn from your mistakes while perfecting closet hacking skill.

Black lighting in the enclosed space is highly effective for closet set ups.

.......,
Closing:
.......:

Well I could go on giving more ideas, but half the fun is doing things your own
way as you go. Personaly I would like to rig up an LED alarms/control panel. Now
I am completely agoraphobic, so being in my closet with the computer and 
everything I need makes it all seem really secure. There is less distractions 
and it is easy to hide from friends and family.

If you do a closet hacking setup, be sure and take a picture of it to motivate
friends to join in on the fun of hermetics (also e-mail it to me!)

"JOE! lets make some wake up juice"

Okay first off, this isn't a joke txt like that buffer overflow exploit if you cook cup
'o noodles in the microwave for 5 min or something. If you're too cheap for jolt, and
hate coffee, here's some stuff that keeps you up, tastes good, and gives you a cool
buzz the first few times unless you ingest large amounts of caffeine and sugar often.

Even then you can make 2 mugs, put milk in and slug them back fast for a cool buzz.
First off acquire a larger than normal sized mug, and get the following ingredients:

Sugar: Fill the mug so it's about a quarter full of sugar, maybe a little less or a
       little more depending on how you like it.

Instant Coffee: The stuff I got is a little strong, but a non-heaping table spoon
	        (the normal sized guys - not the big ones). If you like the taste
	        of coffee, put more in; if you don't, the other stuff covers up
		most the taste leaving you with much needed caffeine.

Chocolate milk: I like the stuff with little marshmellows in it. I put 3-4 heaping
		table spoons of this stuff in. Mmm cocoa.. this shit has caffeine
	        too.. not much though.

Cinnamon: (Optional) put 1-2 pinches in, otherwise it's too much, and real cinnamon is
	  powder and doesn't dissolve. It's not fun to chew powdered cinnamon. Or if you
	  have cinnamon spread, this stuff works great because it dissolves and is sweet.

Milk: Just a quarter of a cup to cool it down, but you MUST put it in after, cuz you need
      it hot to dissolve the other stuff. Irish Cream coffee whitener: this is essential.
      It adds that weird cool flavor, not so much Irish cream like when mixed with everything
      else, but it's not the same without it. I think I put either one or two heaping table
      spoons in, try one to start.Okay so with all the powder stuff, you got half a mug of
      powder, mix it up while the water is boiling. It should be a light brown in color with
      specks of instant coffee. Put the hot water in, not too much 'cause we need to add a
      bit of milk to cool it down. Ok so all the stuff is mixed, put the milk in and let the
      mixture cool for a bit. Then slam it back, if you drink it slowly like your at a tea party
      or some shit or it doesn't give you the nifty buzz. This stuff gives me energy for quake,
      and keeps me up for a few hours. When it wears off you get tired fast!The first few times
      you make this stuff, it tends to give you a stomach ache. That's ok you get used to it.

      There you go; a poor man's Jolt Cola. I'll update this article when i make 4 mugs and slam
      them all back in under 5 minutes.. i'd prolly ralph but do it and find out for yourself.
      Oh yeah, seriously this stuff tastes good so don't bash it 'til you tried it.

This is phlux's reciepe for Magickal Black Elixer
(aka GO GO Gadget Go Juice)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Conjure a whiskey flask, and the following:-Kahlua/SilentSam Vodka (so everything dilutes nicely)

-Powdered Iced Tea (for sugar and taste!)

-Instant Coffee

-Wake-Ups

-Water

-Controlled gag reflexes Mix 50% Kahlua(or 25% Kahlua and 25% Vodka) with 50% water Add 33% Iced tea,
33% instant coffee, and 33% powdered Wake-Ups (caffeine pills). Shake before consuming, vent the gas
caused by chemical reaction in between shakings. You WILL feel a buzz after one swig. NOTES: The gel-
atin in the Iced Tea reacts with some chemicals or something, because when you get to the bottom you
get a fairly large solid chunk of gelatin to chew on.
