Introduction:

Welcome to the latest issue of K-1ine Magazine; issue #48, "He who hesitates...
Masturbates". It's been a long time since we released an issue of K-1ine and
we're happy to announce this is probably the most phile filled issue of all
time, with some of the best writing we've ever published in this 'zine 6 1/2
year history. Big shouts to everyone who contributed to this issue, with extra
shouts to CYB0RG/ASM for his always excellent ascii art, War for his three
articles and lastly h4v3n and fr0st for their two articles. I appreciate you
guys putting in the extra effort to help make this issue a very memorable one.

<rant>

We hope you're not all pulling out your hair during this horrible consumeristic
holiday called the "Christmas Season". All these mindnumbing commercials,
annoying people, and family members that help add to the stress of spending
money that we don't have on presents that won't be fully appreciated make us
want to shoot [insert name] in the fucking head with a 12 gauge shotgun. Grr.

</rant>

So without further ado, I bring you K-1ine #48... sexier and better than ever...

If you like it, great. If you don't, go fuck yourself. Thank you.

 [..:: What is 1xEVDO? ::..]

 <wikipedia>
 Evolution Data Only or Evolution Data Optimized, often abbreviated as EVDO,
 EV-DO,  EvDO, 1xEV-DO or 1xEvDO is a wireless radio broadband data protocol
 being adopted by many CDMA mobile phone providers in New Zealand, Venezuela,
 Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Israel, the United States, Australia and Canada
 as part of the cdma2000 standard. 1xEVDO is pronounced "One Ex: E-Vee-Dee-Oh."
 It is commonly referred in the industry as DO (Dee-Oh).
 </wikipedia>

 So basically EVDO is broadband for phones. Its ALOT faster than standard 1xRTT
 a lot of carriers are using, as well as GPRS and EDGE used on the GSM side of
 things. EVDO can handle speeds up to 2.4 mb/s. Currently it's the fastest wire-
 less broadband system available, but telus is messing around with 3GPP2 which
 is supposed to be about 3 times faster. EVDO is part of the CDMA family.

 [..:: Why should I use this? ::..]

 So It just happens that verison is a bit of a bitch when it comes to linking
 your laptop, PDA or OQO (if your a lucky bastard) to this service. They want
 you to buy a smartphone or PC-card when you buy their already expensive data
 plan, so you can't just use the cheap V-cast data plan with a computer. All
 this hack does is unlock the phone to allow connections to 1xEVDO through
 bluetooth.

 [..:: Why shouldn't I use this? ::..]

 If you're planning to do anything illegal with it. I'm putting this in just
 to cover my own ass. While I'm at it I should probably also stick in the
 oblilatory "If your phone happens to explode, break, delete itself or cause
 a nuclear explosion that puts a rip in the time-space continuum, that's your
 fault. Don't blame me."
 
 [..:: What do I do? ::..]

 This part is pretty simple. I have only tested this with a friends Motorola
 E815, but I'm pretty sure it should work with other phones. Verizon cripples
 their phones by disabling dial up networking on all the phones, but at one
 point they were planning to have customers buy a plan that enables this fea-
 ture, so there is still the option hidden in the phone. All you have to do
 to enable it is turn off the phone, and start it up again. Without going into
 any menus or anything punch in ##DIALUP. This causes DUN to be re-enabled!
 It's just a simple hack specific to verizon phones and is only required once.
 Anyway, I don't own one of these phones, and my friend helped me write a lot
 of this article, so here's what he does to use his phone:

 All I do is I make a shortcut for DUN to dial #777 on bluetooth. Bluetooth
 pairing (creating a DUN connection shortcut to dial #777) is standard pro-
 cedure and is only required once. When I want to connect to the Internet
 via EVDO, I make sure my E815 is on (I have Bluetooth on by default) and I
 double-click on the shortcut - easy and for the time being I have 2 phones
 (my Sony Ericsson W800i with T-Mobile being my primary phone)" 

 So there you have it! The simple way to tap into your high speed phone for
 a greater good!

 [..:: Contact and shouts ::..]

 Shouts to my friend (who goes unnamed) in Prince George, and The Clone for
 publishing this article. If you want to get in contact with me feel to
 email me: Therrol [at] gmail.com. While your at it why don't you check out
 my website, K3B.westcoastphreakers.com. (generously hosted by smes)

 So thanks for reading my sad excuse for an article. I hope my grammar was
 okay, I'm a bit tipsy right about now. Happy hacking!

This article is about AT&T HRID's and some flaws in the way AT&T verifies
your identify and protects their employees privacy. This is an article on
theoretical and practical, all rolled into one.


AT&T HRIDs and PINs

HRID stands for Human Resources ID. Many companies have them, in one form or
another, one name or another. A unique indentifier to identify each employee.
AT&T's implementation of HRID's is a seven digit unique number. Many AT&T
web-based and telephone-based access control systems use HRIDs as part of
the authentication scheme. Sometimes, the HRID is paired with a PIN code.
AT&T PIN codes usually have the following format.

Birthday followed by Social Security Number in the following format:
WW/XX/YY/ZZ

WW = 2 digit month
XX = 2 digit day
YY = 2 digit year
ZZ = last 2 digits of social sec number



PIN codes are used for verification on many AT&T telephone services, such as
when phoning AT&T regarding payroll or benifit information, or when phoning
in trouble reports. Many live operators will ask for an HRID and PIN code
when an AT&T employee calls them and identifies themself as an AT&T employee.
If you want to reset your (or someone else's) AT&T PIN code, you can call
877.HR.ANSWERS, or 877.472.6793. Pressing 9, and then 2 from the main menu
will allow you to speak with someone who can reset your PIN code for you.

Finding AT&T HRIDs


Scouring the web for AT&T HRID's is a fairly straightforward task. A google
search for "inurl:hrid inurl:att" yeilded a number of promising-looking
seven-digit numbers from www.post.att.com (which no longer is a valid site).
Even though the site post.att.com is down, Google still cached a bunch of
links. Also, searching Google for "site:post.att.com", which yields a whole
bunch more possible HRID's hidden in URL's. Thank you google.

There are other methods of getting AT&T HRID's. If you live near AT&T territ-
ory, you could physically go down to an AT&T building, and look at dog-tags,
and glean numbers that way. You could probably social engineer them, as well.
Also, there are plenty of other websites than just post.att.com where HRID's
are kept. A little time spent looking around on the 'net will yeild more
results.



+++



Finding AT&T HRID Information

An AT&T HRID on it's own, though, is nothing special. If you want to link
AT&T HRID's to information, there are a number of ways to go about it.
Probably the easiest is using a site called att.shi.com . This site was
never meant to be a site for linking personal information to AT&T HRID's,
but it's very useful for doing it, anyways.

ATT.SHI.com is a site where AT&T employees can log in and order stuff.
Browsing to the main page of ATT.SHI.com explains how ATT.SHI.com uses
a very bad system for authentication. I quote from the site:


***QUOTE***


You need to activate your User Account in order to access the information
at this site. You will be prompted for your AT&T HRID, which identifies
the account we have reserved for you. Once you submit the User ID form,
you will be brought to a second form which will allow you to change your
Password.  If you do not elect to change your password at this time, your
password will default to the letters "ATT" followed by the seven digits
of your AT&T HRID. Once you have updated your account, your UserName and
Password will be as follows:

    * UserName: ATT followed by your AT&T HRID
      (Example: ATT1234567).
    * Password: By default, your password is ATT followed by your AT&T HRID,
unless you've changed it after activating your account.
      (Example: ATT1234567). 


***********

Nice, huh? If you've got an HRID, and the person connected to the HRID has
used att.shi.com and not changed their password, you're set. But, there's
more. And more is even better. If the person connected to your AT&T HRID
_hasn't_ used the att.shi.com site, you can create a profile for them with
http://att.shi.com/activateuser.asp. Simply browse to http://att.shi.com/
activateuser.asp, and enter the HRID number in the box, and voila. Instant
HRID verification, and personal information related to the HRID. Wonderful.
Also, if you're just wanting a simple Yes/No HRID verification, you could
use https://www.mrsnj.com/empsale/CheckHRID.asp. If you were trying to
brute force HRID's, and wanted to script it, or something, then https://
www.mrsnj.com/empsale/CheckHRID.asp would probably be your best bet.

VoicePost

AT&T runs (ran?) a service called VoicePost (post.att.com ...see a similar-
ity?), which was an automated system by which AT&T employees could get the
phone numbers of other AT&T employees. Sounds fun. The best part is, you
don't even need to be an AT&T employee to use the service. Simply call up
866.288.7678. It's a voice recognition system, with a whole host of features.
The system isn't very active, anymore. Well, it's not active as far as AT&T
is concerned. But, it's still useful, and interesting. The Voicepost service
used to be tied into the 800.FIND.ATT service, which was like a directory
for AT&T employees. You could find information on AT&T employees, AT&T
employment offices and other information. The 800.FIND.ATT mostly out-links
now, to numbers like 866.288.7678. The system is mostly grandfathered now,
but it's still useful to get AT&T employee phone numbers.

When you first call you first call up the AT&T VoicePost service (866.288.
7678), you are greeted with an automated voice that tells you:

"Welcome to AT&T's Voicepost. Please choose on of the following. Contact,
or help."

There are four options I've found from the mainmenu of the VoicePost service.
Contact, Help, Rerecord, and Operator. Operator is, well, operator. But it's
really just an Audix voicemail box. Rerecord lets you re-record the pronoun-
ciation of your name in the VoicePost directory. Help is help, and Contact
is what we really want.

The voicepost system will allow you to find out personal phone numbers of
AT&T employees, if you know their name. Their name. Wooo. So basically, you
just call it up, and when it asks you for a name, you say, "John Smith", or
whatever you want, and then, if their phone number is listed, then it will
tell you the number.

AT&T Alliance Password Resets

If you can get an HRID number, and an associated name, then getting even
_more_ personal information (like home and address work address, and home
phone number) has never been easier, unfortunately. The Alliance training
system for AT&T, Lucent (formerly Westren Electric) and Avaya employees
can be found at http://207.242.156.34/stc/default.htm, or www.employee
growth.com. http://207.242.156.34/stc/default.htm is the one we are going
to deal with. So. You browse to the site, you don't know what the password
is, though. So how can you log in? You can't. But what you can do...password
reset!

You can reset an Alliance password using http://207.242.156.34/stc/passreq.
htm. It's simple. Just enter the first and last name of the AT&T employee,
and the AT&T HRID. You could already have both of these, if you used the
previous methods for obtaining first and last names and HRIDs. Then, you
have the option to enter _ANY_ email address. Let's say that again. _ANY_
email address. Freakin' insane, AT&T. Retarded. Anyways. Within one business
day, an email will be sent to the address you specified, and it will look
something like this:

On 8/8/05, Xxxxx, Xxxx <xxxx@employeegrowth.com> wrote:
>  
>  
> 
> Your Alliance password is your HRID. Thanks for using Alliance services. 

And wow. Now, you can log into the Alliance training area, and look at the
"personal information" page to get even more personal information about AT&T
employees, including but not limited to home and work phone number, home and
work address, private and work email, and HRID number. 

The AT&T Alliance Website is also closely linked to www.employeegrowth.com,
which is a long-distance learning site for AT&T, Lucent and Avaya employees.
The AT&T Alliance Website also discloses FAR too much personal employee
information on their site. AT&T administrators need to be aware that WEB
SECURITY IS IMPORTANT. Weak passwords are unacceptable for a company that
is such a target for theft-of-service and fraud.

Also, please note that the Alliance password is not the same as the AT&T
Global Single Sign-on (https://www.e-access.att.com/ecampus/Saba/attCustom
Login.jsp?site=ATTLearning, as well as many others) password. The AT&T
Single Sign-on is one tough nut to crack, and this Alliance password reset
thing will not work with the Global Single Sign-on.



+++



Ends

As you can see, AT&T ideas about security need to change. Stricter security
needs to be put in place, and AT&T employees, employees, EMPLOYEES need to
be educated about what they should and _should_not_ give out over the phone.
Web-based things need to be tightened up, and phone-based things should ask
for authentication before giving out personal information. The VoicePost
service is mostly grandfathered, but it's still not cleaned up. AT&T should
clean up their mess. Also, the fact that Google is indexing the log-in strings
(which contain the passwords) for AT&T's voicepost service is a problem. Sure,
they've mostly corrected this with their Global Single-Sign on, but they still
need to clean up after themselves. But employees here are really the weakest
link. Employees shouldn't assume you are who you say you are..they should be
doubtful from the start. And the AT&T/Lucent/Avaya Alliance training site
needs to not reset passwords, if you can provide and HRID and name. That's
just not enough information to prove you are who you say you are. Anyone can
walk into an AT&T building, and take pictures of name tags with HRID's on 'em.
It's just too sketchy.

I'll definitely be digging to see what else I can find. Anyways, that's it.

 	  Tel3.com Calling Card System ANI Spoofing Vulnerability

Synopsis:

Corporations that are implementing voice over IP (VOIP) technologies for
the purpose of offering dedicated phone service (i.e. Vonage), or pre-paid
calling card service (i.e. Nettwerked Calling Cards) in an attempt to cut
communications costs associated with POTS-copper lines shouldn't overlook
the obvious security risks. Most businesses implementing VOIP are primarily
concerned with the following three things: voice quality, latency and inter-
operability. To many businesses, security is an after thought, an expense
not worth investing in until something "bad" happens. A reactive instead of
proactive approach to VoIP security is what tends to cost these companies
millions of dollars in intellectual property losses. One such company that
recently caught my attention for lack of security (specifically customer
authentication) is Tel3.com, a business headquartered out of Miami Florida.


Details:

Tel3.com is a company that offers pre-paid, VoIP based, local/international
calling card services worldwide. One feature that Tel3.com offers all its
customers (credit card paying customers I might add), is the ability to make
long distance calls on the Tel3 calling card network without the necessary
use of a unique 12+ digit pin code. Instead Tel3 can authenticate its paying
customers based on Automatic Number Identification (ANI). Yeah, I can't
believe it either.


According to the Tel3.com FAQ (http://www.tel3.com/faq.aspx):

"Tel3 is a service that provides unprecedented low international and domestic
calling rates. Tel3 uses ANI (caller-id) recognition so users do not have to
enter a PIN each time they make long calls from their Instant Access numbers."

The problem with "ANI Billing" is the fact that ANI can be so easily spoofed.
"So what is ANI?", you ask. ANI or Automatic Number Identification is a system
used by the telephone company to determine the number of the calling party.
There are believed to be two types, 'FLEX ANI' (used for e.g. verification
services such as voicemail) which is relatively easy to spoof, and 'Real Time
ANI' (used only for billing purposes on e.g. 800 numbers) which is harder to
spoof [Definition: Hack FAQ ].

ANI Spoofing is done by falsely setting the telephone number you're calling
from to appear as another number somewhere else. Infact the number you can
set does not necessarily need to be a valid one either. In the traditional
sense ANI and Caller ID spoofing was done using the assistance of an operator,
or through a company's PBX (Private Branch Exchange). These methods were not
the most efficient, many operators caught onto what you were doing after a
while, and a lot of previously exploited company PBX's were protected in
secure locations.


"So how can I spoof my ANI without an operator or access to a company's PBX?"

Today ANI spoofing has become much easier to do. With VoIP (Voice over Internet
Protocol) becoming more and more present in today's business world, you now have
the ability to spoof your ANI via this method. This is how its done: a lot of
VoIP carriers never set a Charge Number and allow you to pass through your own
ANI information without ever having a pre-set number implemented on their side.


The Asterisk(tm) Way...

The first and more complicated way to spoof your ANI is by using Asterisk(tm) -
The Open Source Linux PBX. According to their site (www.asterisk.org): "Asterisk
is a complete PBX in software. It runs on Linux and provides all of the features
you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice over IP in many prot-
ocols, and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment
using relatively inexpensive hardware."

What you need is a computer with a Linux compatible network card, basic Linux
knowledge, an Internet connection (preferably a high speed type like ADSL or
Cable), a VoIP hardware phone or software phone, and an account with a VoIP
provider that allows ANI spoofing (i.e. Nufone.net, VoicePulse.com, VoipJet.com).

According to RootSecure (http://www.rootsecure.net/?p=reports/callerid_spoofing):

Follow the instructions in Andy Powell's, 'Getting Started With Asterisk' guide
for the initial Linux install.

Add the following lines to your extension config file in the same context as your
SIP phone.
exten => 33,1,Answer
exten => 33,2,AGI(cidspoof.agi)

Sign up with a VoIP provider.

Add appropriate details into your IAX config file (as issued by your VoIP service
provider).

Download the cidspoof.agi script changing line 77 to the correct username/hostname
for your VoIP IAX service provider, and copy it to /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/.

Start Asterisk

Check your SIP phone has correctly registered / verify you are able to make a SIP
to PSTN call.

Call extension 33, enter the 10 digit number you wish to spoof from, followed by
the 10 digit number you wish to spoof to.

A simpler alternative is to use the command SetCallerID(2121111111) in the "exten-
sions.conf" file direct however it will have to be manually edited and Asterisk
reloaded for every call.


An easier way...

These companies offer the customer the ability to ANI/CID through their pre-paid
service: SpoofTel (http://www.spooftel.com/ - a Spoofing-only service), Nettwerked
Calling Card (http://www.nettwerked.net/callingcard/ - A calling card service that
War and I run. We charge 25 cents per ANI spoof, and also spoof your ANI/CID as
"780-000-1337" by default), and Veratel Communications (http://www.vera-tel.com).
Just check Google, you're bound to find a ton of more companies that offer ANI/CID
spoofing for a reasonable fee. Is this sitting well in your stomachs, Tel3.com? :-)


The possible consequences of Tel3.com using ANI as a form of authentication...

As you can see it's very easy to spoof your ANI/Caller ID. The obvious consequences
of using ANI as a form of authentication the ability for anyone with minimal tech-
nical skills to start using your Tel3.com calling card time without your knowledge
for free telephone calls or other fraudulant activities. At this point all the
potential attacker needs is the telephone number you have bound to your Tel3.com
account and any number of previously mentioned methods to spoof their phone number.


The Solution...

For now I would advise anyone using Tel3.com to contact the company directly and
tell them you are not comfortable with this "convenience" service due to the
severe risks it presents you. In the end Tel3.com is going to be the ones who will
need to re-think their marketing, and go back to the way traditional calling card
companies go; by using a unique and difficult to bruteforce 12-14 digit pin code
for its user authentication.


Final Thoughts...

This article was not written as a new, exciting, or mind blowing tutorial on ANI
spoofing. So before you open up your e-mail client to send me some hate mail you
stupid (and mostly American) fucks, lets get real for a second; nearly every
idiots in the so-called H/P "scene" knows how to spoof ANI/CID. This article was
written to point out that not only are banks and mobile companies using ANI as a
form of authentication, but now our beloved US/CDN Calling Card companies are too.

These companies need to wake up and smell the luke warm coffee: ANI AUTHENTICATION
IS NOT A SECURE METHOD OF VERIFYING WHO YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE. Quit it, or expect to
be exploited until the end of time.

Good Day.

Telus Censoring Customers and Employees!

(An article on the on-going Telus Strike and the hell management
is putting its very own customers and employees through lately...)

Contact me: theclone@hackcanada.com
Web-site: http://www.nettwerked.net 

It seems the Telus management has stooped to an all-time low -- is it even possible
to get any lower than they already are? Well apparently so. According to a recent
e-mail a few of the crew members at Hack Canada received, Telus management has gone
as low as censoring TWU (Telecommunications Workers Union) member employees from
participating in strike e-mail threads by disconnecting their Internet Service, and
suspending them from the company! Furthermore Telus is deliberately blocking *ALL*
Telus ISP customers from accessing the TWU/Voices of Change web-site.

Read below at this disgusting censorship on behalf of the E-Slut pigs. Do your part;
contact the CRTC (yes, the lapdog), the media (A-Channel, Global, your local newsp-
aper, etc.) and let them know what you think about Telus censorship of not only its
employees but of its very own customers. To Darren Entwistle and clowns: your empl-
oyees and your customers are the ones who keep your company from going bankrupt.
They are the ones who allow you rich fucks to buy second homes and fancy cars for
your trophy wives. And remember this; you're a publicly traded company. It's only 
a matter of time before your shareholders decide your company isn't even worth
investing in anymore. Don't worry, I see that day coming very soon indeed.

If an employee, customer, or shareholder is reading this message right now: QUIT
YOUR JOB AT TELUS AND WORK AT A COMPANY THAT WILL RESPECT YOU, GO WITH COMPETITORS
FOR YOUR LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE SERVICE (i.e. FreeWorldTel, Nettwerked Calling
Cards *heh heh*, Primus, Veratel, Vonage, etc.), AND INVEST IN A COMPANY THAT
ISN'T FUCKING OVER ITS CUSTOMERS & EMPLOYEES!

Read the e-mail below to learn about what Telus is up to...

Subject: [Fwd: Telus Censorship and You!]
To: theclone@hackcanada.com

Hey, I'm Long time reader of hackcanada. From what I've read, your crew
is big into freedom and not a big fan of the telcos, So I thought this
might interest you.

My dad is a TWU (Telecommunications Workers Union) member and Telus
employee, He's been promoting and working with the TWU before the
strike. Recently Telus has started to do some really shady shit in
regards to his internet connection. Telus employees have been suspended
for participating in some of his email threads, Telus canceled his
internet connection a day before the strike claiming he was spamming.
For the most part I thought my dad was actually being a paranoid nut.

But now, they've have reached a whole new level. It appears telus is
actually blocking ALL Telus ISP customers from accessing the TWU/Voices
of Change website! This is outrageous and deserves real media attention.
This is censorship at its worst.

I would like to read your opinions on this, or maybe some next steps.
-Ryan
---------

The e-mail from Ryan Barber's dad (a Telus employee)...

*How desperate can Telus get..?*

On a personal level in the last 5 days, Telus has removed my internet
access on the night of a strike. 10 hours later, I believe Telus
purposely made my phone un-useable through double trunking, Now for
everyone else, ermployee or not Telus has now blocked access for
all Telus Home Internet Users to the Voices For Change site.

Voices For Change is a site for TWU members to discuss TWU issue, as an
independant 3rd party.

Many of us have parents, grandparents, or family members, who have fought
to protect our rights to freedom of speech. Many give their lives, and is
not beyond the realm now.

Pls. take a moment to be active and honour your own past.

Shame on those that insult the memories of the past, of lost family who
fought trying to win the right to freedom of speech. Shame on the managers,
and retired managers, and those willing to cross a picket to line their
own pockets... you are the soldiers supporting wrong army.

Shame on Telus for it's complete disrespect for the past and those we lost.

*--------------------------------------------------------*

PS: Feel free to write to Darren Entwistle or Karen Radford and tell them
what you think about their attack on a fundamental right within our society.

Please pass this along to anyone you know that wants to protect freedom of
speech. They're are many good ISP's out their that won't take away your
freedom of speech at the drop of a dime to line their own pockets.

This is a Canadian fight NOT a labour/management fight. Please feel free
to post this open letter or to pass it on to others. Canadians have to be

 Disclaimer
 ----------

 If you are going to be a stupid fuck and actually use this information for 
 attempting criminal activities you'll probably get caught.  I am releasing
 information that I have found, how you use it is your choice, and I am not 
 responsible for your actions.

 Foreword
 --------
 OK everyone has heard it, "TELUS is censoring www.voices-for-change.com!"
 Yeah well that just makes you want to go to the web site and support them 
 even more.  This phile is nothing special; it's for the people that need it
 to fuck Telus up the ass and still get to www.voices-for-change.com If you 
 are on a Telus dial-up or ADSL connection you will not be able to reach the 
 web site www.voices-for-change.com and this phile will show you how.


 Details
 -------

 Most people that read this will not be using Linux but I am going to show you
 both Windoze and Linux methods to get to any censored website.  The theory is 
 very simple and the same on windows and Linux.

 Setting Up Your Browser
 -----------------------

 Fire Fox
  --------
 On a Linux box running Fire Fox 1.0.6 all you have to do is go to "Edit" and
 "Preferences"  then under "General" click the "Connection Settings" button and 
 a new window will pop up.  In this new window select "manual proxy 
 configuration" and enter a IP of a public proxy server (read on and you'll find
 out how to find one) and the port that it runs on.  Save the settings and close
 all Fire Fox windows.  

 Internet Explorer
 -----------------

 To setup access to censored websites (by Telus) under internet explorer click
 on "Tools" and then "Internet Options".  A new window will pop up and then you
 click on the "Connections" tab and then the "LAN Settings" button.  Now you 
 will see a second window.  Under "Proxy Server" select the check box to "Use a
 proxy server for your LAN" Then enter the IP of the public proxy server (read
 on and you'll find out how to find one) under "Address:" and the port number
 in the "Port:" entry.  Select "OK" twice and close all Internet Explorer
 windows.

 How To Find a Public Proxy
 --------------------------

 This is very easy to do.  Just go to www.publicproxyservers.com and they list
 5 pages of public proxy servers with ports all around the world.  Some are
 faster than other and some will not work that well for you.  Testing this and
 going to www.voices-for-change.com I used 207.248.240.118:80 in Mexico.  This
 will not work if you use a proxy server from Canada that is on a Telus
 connection so try to use a proxy in a different country.

 Conclusion
 ----------

 So now you should have access to www.voices-for-change.com your internet
 connection will not be as fast as it was before because you are now routing all
 your internet traffic through a proxy server.  Only use a proxy server when 
 you want to get to a site that is censored by Telus.  

 Keep this info in mind and pass it along to everyone that you can.  This is the
 first internet site that Telus has blocked, I am sure it will not be the last.

 Again this phile is not as technical as my others but this is necessary info
 for Telus customers.  Detail and explanations were left out because I wanted 
 this phile on the net quickly.

 1. forward
 ----------

This paper is written to show you some  security  pro-
blems in internet cafes. Many people  are  using  this
cafes for sending emails, playing games, chatting  and
surfing but almost they don't know much about the  se-
curity riscs there.

This paper is written for information and not for  any
illegal activities. Have a nice reading.

 


 2. the attackers
 ----------------

I think in the net you have a lot of attackers but  in
this example we will only turn to two groups  we  will
find in internet cafes. The operator and the user.


 2.1 the operator
 ----------------

In most internet cafes the operator has the control o-
ver any computer which is connected to the network. He
can lock the connection to the net, looking  how  long
you are online, see on what  pages  you  are  surfing,
in which chatrooms you are talking, what texts you are
reading and also maybe which keys you hit on your key-
board. He could sniff some private  information,  your
passwords and what ever you can imagine or with  other
words - your input often is  a  security  risc.  Never
trust operators. ;-) But also an  operator  can  be  a
victim - when a user is hacking a computer or the  in-
ternet cafe network.


 2.2 the user
 ------------

The user often is playing, chatting, surfing,  downlo-
ading and reading - probably mostly reading the email.
But a user could also install some programs like  key-
logger, sniffer and other spyware. With this  programs
he could spy out some other users and also the  opera-
tor. His programs could  be  running  for  some  days,
weeks or how long ever. Next time he is on the  hacked
computer or network, he could send the logfiles to his
emailaccount or his programmed software is doing  this
automaticly. Maybe he got access from an other  hacked
computer to the cafe. People often use the same  pass-
words on different  accounts  and  mostly  they  don't
change their passwords from time to  time.  So  others
could have an easy access to their privacy.

 


 3. tools
 --------

In this section you will find some tools like sniffer,
keylogger and other spyware for windows and linux. You
also will find here the adress to  download  and  test
the utilities. You will find a lot of  more  tools  on
the net but this would blast this paper. ;-)  Use  all
tools you will find here in this paper only  to  test,
check or secure your system or  network  for  security
holes.

With a sniffer you can  filter  and  manipulate  data-
streams, sniff the IP, socket adresses, ports, access-
points, user ids, the version of  the  operating  sys-
tem and much more. With a sniffer you can  sniff  from
outside of the network or computer, f.e. with a  wire-
lesslan sniffer.

With a keylogger, the name says it, you can log  every
input which comes from the keyboard. Every key you hit
is written to a logfile. With  this  logfile  you  can
find out passwords, the content  of  emails  and  much
more. A keylogger must be installed on the computer to
log some input from the keyboard.

Spyware could be a trojaner  who  is  listening  on  a
port, on a firewall or who has passed by every securi-
ty and has successfully penetrate the system.  With  a
scanner you can scan for open ports,  known  bugs  and
security holes, the IP,  the  operating  system,  used
software and much more. You also can often tracer  the
location of the target with some tracerprograms.


 3.1 windows
 -----------

This operating system you will find up to 99% in  each
internet cafe i think cause most people are  using  it
and it is easy for beginners to use. Most games people
are playing are running under windows.  Just  a  click
here and a click there and every thing is running. But
this system is also very insecure. If an attacker  has
access to a windows system then he mostly can  control
everything on the system.


 3.1.1 sniffer
 -------------

wirelesslan sniffer

 3.1.2 keylogger
 ---------------

search for yourself

http://www.google.com ;-)


 3.1.3 spyware
 -------------

backdoor client

http://www.cultdeadcow.com/


 3.2 linux
 ---------

Linux is an opensource operating system. Most linux  or
unix systems are for free. If  you  have  never  worked
with a linux system than it is a bit difficult to  use.
You can get some complete free operating  systems  like
gentoo, freebsd and so on at: www.linuxiso.org  I  also
can recommend kantotix from www.kanotix.de it  is  good
for experts and for beginners ( like  me  ;-)  too.  To
control everything on a linuxbox you must be a  superu-
ser also called root. Without root you can't do  every-
thing, f.e. create a new userprofile on the computer or
whatever.


 3.2.1 sniffer
 -------------

network sniffer

http://www.tcpdump.org/


 3.2.2 keylogger
 ---------------

 3.2.3 spyware
 -------------

scanner by fyodor

 4. how to use the tools
 -----------------------

Here i will explain how to use the tools for configura-
tion, control and security.


 4.1 configuration
 -----------------

You can use these tools for a better  configuration  of
your hard and software. First you have  to  check  your
system or network for known bugs  and  security  holes.
Try to break the security of your system or network and
than fix the problem, f.e. with a  wirelesslan  sniffer
or scanner program you can check the funkrange from the
accesspoint to the card. With a scanner and  a  sniffer
or backdoor server you can test your firewall.


 4.2 control
 -----------

If you wanna control the main  computer  of  a  network
where often the admin is sitting, you can use a keylog-
ger. This is usefull to check the  system  and  network
for unauthorized access. If any unauthorized person has
access to the computer or network then the logfiles  of
the keylogger program should show this.  You  can  also
install backdoor clients on other computers to  control
them, f.e. shutdown the computer, start  the  internet-
connection and so on. When i say control - i don't mean
spy at others, i mean only for controlling the  system.
Control a system and control a person are two very dif-
ferent things. ;-)


 4.3 security
 ------------

However these tools are for testing the security on your
system and not for illegal activities. Use these  tools
to check your system or network for known  and  unknown
security holes - there are much more ways  than  these.
Develop your own security concept  that  is  proper  to
your needs and your network or system.  Security  is  a
concept with lots of ways.

 


 5. attacker detection
 ---------------------

Detecting attacks is very hard if you are a novice user
or administrator but without detection your  system  at
all is very insecure. Protection is the step before de-
tection. We will talk about this in section 6.


 5.1 intrusion detection
 -----------------------

To detect an attacker on your system you can do  a  lot
of different things. A good way is to  check  the  log-
files on your system as often you can and control  also
the size of these files. Make a checksum  with  md5  on
important files. Use tools  like  snort,  tripwire  and
chkrootkit. Control your traffic and  make  a  scan  to
find open ports that should be closed. Create a  little
honeypot to find attackers before they find you. ;-)


 5.2 authorisation
 -----------------

If an attacker has passed by every security and  is  on
a computer, he should have a hard way to  do  something
on it. That means he must become the highest  authority
first to do important things on the computer. This is a
complex field. Find out the best security  concept  for
your computer or network. Everything what is  important
for you and others should be protected. Don't give per-
sons you don't know enough admin rights.

 


 6. how to avoid attacks
 -----------------------

A good protection is the best way to avoid attacks from
other people. You can use encryption  and  also  update
your system and programs every few days.


 6.1 encryption
 --------------

Encryption is good for networkconnections,  chatconnec-
tions,  private  data, your email and also for surfing.
For networkconnections or chatconnections you  can  use
ssl or ssh. When you are using a  wirelesslan  network,
turn the wep key on. To encrypt your  private  data  or
emails use pgp or gnupg. For a secure  surfing  in  the
world wide web you can use anon proxyserver with an  o-
pensource browser like firefox and you  can  also  surf
mostly on sites with encryption support. And don't for-
get - use secure passwords.


 6.2 updates
 -----------

Check your system and your programs as  often  you  can
for new updates. An update is often a bugfix or  a  new
implementation of a new feature. But sometimes  with  a
new update also comes a new bug.  ;-)  Nevertheless  do
updates if a new version of your system or  program  is
existing. Download your bugfixes, patches  and  updates
only from trusted sites or the original site  from  the
system or program.

 


 7. rest of risc
 ---------------

The biggest hole in every network, software and  system
is the human himself.  He is programming, hacking,  ad-
ministrating or whatever. Sometimes you have  to  trust
admins but at least you don't  know  them.  Trust  only
people you know good. Use opensource software where you
will find the sourcecode to every program and on  which
lots of people are working on, to  find  new  bugs  and 
make new updates. However without a look  in  the  code
you can't trust a program. ;-)

 


 8. last words
 -------------

I hope you have learned a bit about security with  this
paper. This information here is not only  for  internet
cafes. It shows how insecure things often are  and  you
don't know it. Use your time useful and also  use  your
brain and trust nobody you don't know good enough.

Do-It-Yourself Electric Lock Pick

This all came about when a friend from my school told me he seen some person use,
what it looked to be an electric toothbrush to open this padlock. So I told him
he must of seen an Electric Pick, but he insisted it was a toothbrush. So I dec-
ided it was time to do a little project :P I went to the local Wal-Mart and bou-
ght a Crest Spinbrush Pro. I chose this peticular model of toothbrush because it
used gears to make the head of the brush move up and down and also osolate, then
I seen it used 2 AA batteries, So I thought to myself.. well that won't be enough
to make the pick move... so I went to the local dollar store and bought 2 9volt
battaries, then headed over to RadioShack and bought a package of 9volt battery
clips, then I was on my way home.

Items bought:

1 x Crest SpinBrush Pro $7.88 CND
2 x 9volt Batteries $1.50 CND
1 x bag of battery clips $2.75 CND
1 x microswitch approx $1.50 CND
1 x JBWeld approx $10.00 CND
1 x Hacksaw blade $1.00 CND

Tools Needed:
Dremel
Grinding Wheel ( to make pick )
soldering pen
solder
JBWeld

Alright so I sat down to have a look at the Crest Spinbrush Pro, and found out
there was no real way of getting the motor and gears out without having to cut
it open. This is where the dremel comes in. I followed the line where the 2
plastics are joined on each side of the Crest Spinbrush Pro. So after I cut
open the case I took out the motor and find where the battery connections to
the motor is. Once I found the connection places, I soldered a 9volt battery 
clip to one of the points and soldered another of the points to a switch, from
the switch I went back to the battery clip wire (See Diag. 1). Put everything
back in the Crest Spinbrush Pro casing and tape it all back together with some 
electrical tape.

+============================================+


Don't try to buy anything other the the Crest SpinBrush Pro because for the
electric lock pick we need something to go forward and backwards, and all
the other battery powered tooth brushes osolate.

Now we move onto making the pick.

This is where the hacksaw blade comes in. Use the grinder wheel to grind
down the pick into this shape (See Diag. 2).

          |===================/

+============================================+                      


Now take the JBWeld and put some on the pick and press and hold it on to the
little metal stub sticking out from the motor. IMPORTANT:: Make sure when the
motor stub goes back that it doesn't hit the plastic cover of the Crest Spi-
nBrush Pro.

Now when the JBWeld dries you now have a portable electric lock pick! Have
fun... and REMEMBER don't use this information to do anything illegal, If
you do, I will NOT be responsible and you will be held accountable for your
actions.

If you are having troubles with making this device, you can check out the
pictures of the device that I made. @ http://fr0st.no-ip.org/diyeleclockpick/

		How to Fix Your Credit the Easy Way


In our society there exists an Absolute Moralistic Machine called the Credit 
Bureau. They decide who gets credit and who doesn't, if by chance you made 
some mistakes in the past or were perhaps fucked over by, or married a cunt 
who fucked up your credit then too bad for you.

Wrong, they have little or no power; they just have people believing they 
have power. They are stand alone agencies and cannot cross reference 
information with any Government agency; it's illegal and can't be done.

Oh I know they talk and threaten and try to intimidate and do intimidate 
people.

In the U.S.A. Credit agencies do have the power to hunt a person's ass down 
and garnishee their wages, not in Canada though, in Canada the only Agency 
that has any real resources to hunt you down and garnishee your wages or go 
into your bank account is the Federal Government, not even the Provincial 
Government can do it.

Equifax and Transcanada Credit are fuckall, they can't do shit except harass 
you by calling and threatening, same as collection Agencies. I've told a 
number of them to go fuck themselves and they never bothered me again.

People in Canada for some reason are under the spell of the U.S.A.. They 
think our country operates like the U.S., it doesn't.

We are a whole different Country and have different laws altogether, in many 
different areas that I could go on about but won't be covering here.

What I am going to outline here is a legal loophole through which a person 
can start a whole new credit file, this is a legal form of what is called 
"Credit File Segregation".

Credit file segregation is highly illegal unless you do it the way I explain 
it, through one tiny flaw in the system it becomes legal, and the government 
basically gives you a license to do it.


1. Go to your local police station and report your social insurance card as 
lost or stolen, tell them someone stole it at the bar or some stupid shit, 
use your imagination.

2. They will make a report; get a copy of the report.

3. Take the report to the nearest HRDC and tell them you lost your SIN card 
and are afraid someone will use it to obtain credit by false means. They 
will ask you for the police report and then get you to fill out some forms 
for a new SIN number.

That's right boys and girls; you get a whole new SIN number generated for 
you by the Government.


In a few weeks your new card with a new number will come in the mail and it 
doesn't cost you anything because they only charge for a replacement card, 
not new ones. In the letter you receive with your new card they will tell 
you it is your responsibility to report your new number to the Credit 
Agencies, chuck it, maybe you don't see too well or weren't wearing your 
glasses that day and didn't read that part.

Now you can build a new credit file because you are basically a new person 
as far as the Credit Agencies are concerned, but there are a few more 
details that you have to pay attention to when you apply for credit.

When you are applying for credit make sure to change a few details, such as 
dropping your middle name or changing your address, if all your personal 
information is exactly the same on the application as it has been in past 
applications there is a chance they will figure out you're the same person.

I'll give you an example. Let's say that John William Mclean has a fucked up 
credit rating and changes his SIN number the legal way and then applies for 
a credit card online. He should apply as just John Mclean; it isn't illegal 
to drop your middle name.

If you have moved since your last credit file that's even better, they can't 
link you. Credit Agencies primarily use the SIN number to identify people.

If someone is reviewing an application for credit they type all the 
information into the computer and it pretty much has to be an exact match 
for your past file to come up, if you have a new SIN you won't come up at 
all.

If you are 20 years old they won't really think anything of it, if you are 
40 years old they will be suspicious and do some digging wondering why you 
don't have a credit file.

If all your information is the same like, where you work, address, etc. but 
your SIN number is different they will link the two files and you won't get 
any credit.


My suggestion is to change a few of the details like I said earlier, that 
way if they do dig they still won't be able to link you to your past credit 
file, that guy is gone now in a manner of speaking.

Remember though, you are now a new person to the Credit Agencies but you do 
not have any credit rating now, good or bad.

It will still be easier to get credit with no credit rating than with a bad 
one.

To start with only apply for two credit cards a month, the reason I say this 
is because every time you apply for one it puts a hit on your credit file 
and you don't want too many, that looks suspicious.

What I have learned to do is to see what bank is handing them out. For 
instance, I look in the newspaper in the business section and see what banks 
profits were down that quarter, they are usually the ones that have special 
promotions to boost profits for the next year and one of the things they do 
is hand out credit cards to people who have little or no credit rating, they 
are still a lower risk than people who have had bad credit by their 
calculations... or the criteria by which they approve people for credit.

It will take some time but don't be discouraged if you get rejected a few 
times, you are starting all over again and have to work your way up. It 
won't take long after you get your first card until you start qualifying for 
more and more credit.

The University of Alberta is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The U of A operates a large telephone system just for communication
within their expansive tunnel system. I came across some documentation.
Here it is.

TOA INTERCOM OPERATION



Press to Talk (PTT)

The TOA stations are sound influenced (the station with the most ambient
noise will dominate the conversation). To overcome one-way conversation,
press the PTT Key to converse in the other directions.

* Note: If both parties press the PTT button at the same time, the party
who presses the bar last will have dominance. This condition will continue
until the party which cannot communicate presses PTT .6 to clean this
condition and return to handsfree mode.



Continuous Calling 

If the station is set-up for continuous calling (not all stations are)
it will continue to ring until the handset is lifted or any number on
the keypad, except C or PTT, is touched.


Privacy

Set privacy switch to "on" when you do not wish to accept a call. When
the party you are calilng is in the privacy mode a one-way message can
be delivered by pressing the PTT bar.


Secretary Transfer

If the station is programmed at the exchange for this - set privacy
switch to "on" to re-route calls to the designated station.


Single-Digit Dialing (.60)

Single digit dialing can be accomplished by pressing .60 then the
number of the station required. (i.e. 811). When properly entered
a confirmation tone will be heard. Single digit dialing can then
be done by pressing the 0.

* Note: Single digit dialing is only possible when the station has
not already had this function programmed at the exchange.


Call Forwarding (.6)

This function enables you to recieve calls made to your original
station at another location. When leaving your sattion press .6
then the station number you are going to. Calls will then autom-
atically be routed to that station.

* Note: Call fowarding must be cleared at the originating station
or calls will continue to go to the programmed station. To clear,
press .6 and your original station number.


Conference Call (.5) 
Up to four station can be joined to condcut a conference all.
Press .5 then dial the first station number, when station is
connected then dial the next number, repeat for the fourth
station if required. To clear press .. or hang up. If the
conference originator drops out all calls close.


Mic Off (.7) 

By pressing .7 the intercom mic will be disconnected and the
call will be put on hold. A hold tone will be heard by the
party on hold. To return to the conversation press .7 again
and call will be resumed.


Call Transfer

Calls may be transferred to another station by dialing the
desired station number during the conversation. The station
which originated the call goes on hold until the third part
accepts the call. The transferring station then completes
the connection by pressing C. If the third does not wish to
accept the call or there is no asnwer at the third station
press .. to return to the originating station.


Zone Paging

To conduct a zone page press .8 and the number of the zone
desired (i.e. .81). We presently have 6 zones.


Paging Response (.9)

To respond to a zone page, press .9 and you will automatically
be connected with the party who placed the page.

* Note: Dialing must be completed within 5 seconds or the line
will automatically release.

Tunnel P.A. System. Give message after the tone, unit times
out after one (1) minute.

[note: the 492-5400 number no longer works. My guess is that
the system was old enough that it was back before the split,
on 403.492.5400, and when the area code split occured, the
PSTN indial got lost in translation. But either way, it
doesn't work.]


By the way, you'll probably need physical access to get any
of this to work, unless you have some psychic way of contro-
lling the phones. It's a very interesting system, nonetheless.

----------

If you are going to be a stupid fuck and actually use this information for 
attempting criminal activities you'll probably get caught.  I am releasing 
information that I have found, how you use it is your choice, and I am not 
responsible for your actions.

Foreword
--------

If you do not know what websense is you have not experienced the most Orwellian 
piece of network software out there.  Websense.s main purpose is to block 
access to web pages and block use of certain protocols.  Websense also has 
many different functions like extremely detailed reporting on user's web
activity.  If this is not big brother I don.t know what is.

The watching eye of big brother does not come cheap either.  For use of
websense for one year with 100 clients you are looking at just under $3,000
CDN! This is the base edition of websense.  When you purchase this software 
you will be pressured into purchasing additional add-ons.  If you are 
encountering websense you will have to work for a large organization.  This is 
not a piece of software that a small business will purchase.  I do have to say 
though if a company does purchase this software they are getting a real solid 
system.  I have many users try many times to get around websense without any 
success.

After giving up on this project for a few months I tried again.  This time not 
trying to beat websense itself but the other components that it uses.  Not 
long after starting again I have found a few ways to have fun with your 
websense administrator.  Remember this information is presented to websense 
administrators so that they can prevent these actions from happening.

Information
-----------

Websense has many ways to track and block internet traffic.  It can block 
traffic by the WebSense URL database, protocol, user defined keywords, or by 
specific URL.  With this much control blocking internet traffic it.s really 
hard to get by.  WebSense.s URL database holds the following categories that 
you can block by:

|---Business and Economy

Again this is not the only way WebSense can filter traffic.  In addition to 
the URL database WebSense can also filter by protocol used.  The following is 
the list of protocols that can be allowed or blocked.

If websense is setup properly then there is virtually no way around the 
system.  So you have to get creative and try a few things.  In the details 
section of this paper I will go through various different possible ways around 
a WebSense system.  

Websense can be setup many different ways with many different firewalls or 
even without a firewall so this information may vary from setup to setup.  All 
my testing has been done on a medium sized fully routed network with WebSense 
5.5 and a Cisco Pix 515e.  All traffic to the internet has to go through the 
Cisco Pix, and in the Pix configuration file HTTP, HTTPS, ActiveX, Java 
Applet, and FTP are all setup to use the websense server for filtering.  So 
any request goes from the client to the Pix then to the WebSense server, back 
to the Pix, and then the client will either get the web content or a WebSense 
error message.  When the web content request is sent to the WebSense server a 
database containing everything is created in a MSSQL server.  Different SQL 
servers can be used with WebSense but in this environment there is a MSSQL 
server.  This database runs the WebSense reporter.  Remember this, we will 
have some fun with it later.  So how the hell do you get around WebSense?

The tests have been performed on a basic setup of WebSense 5.5 using the 
default Global policy which is detailed in Apendix A.  I used a basic user 
account that did not have administrative rights on the network which meant any 
user that was smart enough could have accomplished any of these procedures.


Details
-------

1.  Proxy Servers . The most obvious way I thought to get around a web filter 
was to use a proxy server.  I never thought that this was going to work until 
I tried it.  Once I did I couldn.t believe that it was that easy to get around 
a default installation of websense.  

First go to http://www.publicproxyservers.com on a network that doesn.t have 
websense and find a proxy server.  I used one in the USA that used port 8080 
and was labled Anonymous.  Next open your browser, I am going to use Internet 
Explorer 6 in all examples.  Click Tools, Internet Options, then Connections. 
Once you are there simply click on the .LAN Settings. button and fill out the 
proxy server information.  Close your browser and reopen it.

Now you can surf the net unfiltered and you will not be logged by websense, 
although you will be logged by the Cisco Pix or whatever firewall the company 
is using.  This is quick, easy, and works like a charm. With the only downside 
being your connection speed.  So if you have a high speed connection at your 
home create your own proxy server and use it.  This will make your connection 
a lot quicker.

How does the websense administrator fix this?  Well in this case it isn.t 
easy, from what I have seen.  WebSense does automatically block out .proxy 
avoidance. which are websites that allow you to surf anonymously but there is 
nothing (that I have found) that will block out known proxy servers.  So at 
the firewall you will have to make sure all outgoing ports (except the ones 
that are needed) are blocked and then use websense to block all private IP 
addresses.  To ensure they are all blocked the admin will also have to closely 
watch the firewall logs for interesting IP addresses.  

So what did this tell us?  Public proxies are a quick and easy way around 
websense and the admin will have a .fun. time blocking it.

2.  Terminal Services -  Another way to get around WebSense is obvious.  When 
you make a web content request from the internal network it is captured by the 
firewall and filtered by the WebSense server.  So just make the request from 
outside the network.  This is where terminal services come in.  

You will need an external high speed connection and a PC setup with terminal 
services or SSH.  Once this is setup simply take control of the external PC 
from the internal network.  It.s another simple solution that is overlooked by 
the default global policy, and it isn.t logged.

How does the WebSense administrator prevent this?  All that has to be done is 
the remote access protocols have to be disabled as well as SSH.  That.s all 
that has to be done to prevent this solution from working.  Now think, don.t 
you think WebSense should include this in their default global policy?  What 
the hell are these corporate whores thinking?  Obviously it.s not security.

3.  Web Based Proxies . This one took me a while to figure out.  If an 
administrator blocks out proxy servers it.s not a big deal because you can 
make your own right.  Well this is just another way to do that.  There are
many services on the internet that has .anonymous web browsing. for free but 
websense blocks these sites in the default global policy under .Proxy 
Avoidance..  Never fear, you can make your own.

You will need a system outside the websense network that has a high speed 
connection to the internet.  If it is running Windows then go to http://
www.peacefire.org and download circumventor.  This is a very easy program to 
setup under windows.  Once this program is setup all you have to do is in the 
websense network go to the IP address that is given to you at the end of the 
setup process.  It will look something like https://xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx/cgi-
bin/nph-513213.cgi Then you are off on the net unfiltered and not logged.  

If you have an external machine that has a high speed internet connection that 
is running linux it can still be done but it.s a little harder.  Go to http://
www.jmarshall.com and download the cgiproxy tool.  Set it up according to the 
website and everything will work just like the windows box.

By this time WebSense administrators are getting mad.  To stop this from 
working again the administrator has to block private IP addresses.  This 
doesn.t always work though.  A clever individual who really wants to get 
around websense could load one of these cgi scripts on a server that has a 
fully qualified domain name.  Now the administrator has to watch logs very 
carefully to notice high traffic to one domain.

4.  Alternative Gateways . This is very unlikely to work because any company 
that has websense will probably not have an unprotected .back door..  It.s 
worth while to mention though.  On the network that uses websense scan all IP 
addresses using NMap or another port scanner to find an IP address that will 
forward traffic to the internet.  

Now if this works your administrator should be kicked in the ass repeatedly 
and fired.  Sometimes very stupid administrators have an internet connection 
plugged into a switch that users are on.  Try to obtain an IP address using 
DHCP and if you get a public IP address you are really lucky, and your admin 
is an idiot!  Like I said this will rarely be the case so don.t get your hopes 
up.

5.  No User . If you have tried all other options above this and you still 
have not had any luck this is where we start getting really risky.  You may 
not be able to get to all sites but at least you will not be tracked as easy 
for extensive web use.  

On a win9x machine when you start up don.t log in.  You should be able to get 
to the internet if you are going through a pix that does not require 
passwords.  All this does for you is gives you access to the internet without 
your username being logged with the internet requests, but your IP address 
will be.  So change your address as much as you can, that is if you can.  Web 
pages that are blocked by websense will still be blocked but at least your 
admin will not know who exactly is spending so much time on the internet. 

6.  Cisco Pix Filtering Rules . This is a way around websense that is very 
destructive and malicious.  So if you don.t want to get fired never use this 
method.  When the Cisco Pix is set up to use WebSense filtering there is an 
option that can be enabled to .Allow outbound traffic if URL server is not 
available..  What this means is that if the cisco pix is unable to connect to 
the WebSense server it will just allow the request through. 

So what does this mean?  Well if your administrator has enabled this option 
then all you have to do is get rid of the websense server and you are home 
free.  There are many ways to do this and I will quickly list a few:

DOS attack
DDOS attack
Unplug the network cable from the server
Unplug the power cable from the server
Physically destroy the server

You get the point.  These are very unlikely things to do on your work network 
just to get internet access but it does work. 

7.  Having Some Fun - OK let's say you have way too much time on your hands at 
work and, well your administrator is a dip shit.  Yes this is the case for 
some people.  So what you need to do is get your hands on a MSSQL password.  
First you should always try your domain username and password, cause you never 
know it may work, but then you are stuck with having to try and delete logs.  
So let's say you have read a few articles on MSSQL and you get the SA account 
password.  If you don't know much about MSSQL go find some info it's not that 
hard.  Now it's time to have some fun.

In the database wslogdb55 there is a table called INCOMING.  This is where we 
will frame someone.  Find the user's USER_ID in the table USER_NAMES and then 
start making fake entries in the INCOMING table.  If the admin uses Websense 
Reporter he/she will see the extreme internet use by one user or you can 
actually make it look like the user got to blocked web sites.

Conclusion
----------

Although these are not perfect ways around websense they sure as hell help a 
person that is trying to get around the software.  The best way around websense
is to not be on a network that uses it.  As this paper is being created the 
next version of websense is being created, and I am sure that these methods 
will be stopped by default.  So right now enjoy these quick and easy ways 
around the software, that is if they work.  Remember these methods will only 
work if your administrator doesn't take the time to fully customize websense.

Phreaking the NEC i-Series phone systems
by war



The i-Series of desktop fones are manufactured by NEC. The 
i-Series includes the 28i, 124i and 384i phones. These phones 
were built by NEC for use in an office environment, and they 
perform satisfactorily in that role. NEC i-Series phones are 
used by a number of small and large businesses in North 
America. 

This article might, possibly, hopefully, give you some insight 
into power-use (or phreaking, whatever) of the i-Series fones.
That's the idea, anways. I'm assuming a previous basic knowledge 
of how PBX systems work.

The i-Series phones have quite a large array of features, too 
large to explain every feature in detail in one article. 

A quick overview of some of the i-Series features:

Alarm
Automated Attendent (Voice Announcer)
Background Music
Barge In (Emergency Interrupt-ish)
Call Forwarding
  Follow-me
  Off-Premise
  DND Override
Call Waiting/Camp On
Conferencing
  MeetMe Internal/External Conferencing
  MeetMe Internal/External Paging
Directory Dialing
Internal/External Paging
Programmable Function Keys
Soft Keys (on select models)
Reverse Voice Over
Room Monitoring
Tandem Trunking
Voice Mail


Physical Access

As the topic says, let's first assume you have physical access 
to the actual phone. So, you may ask, "How do I gain physical access?"
It's not that hard, really. If you spot an i-Series phone in a shop, 
you could simply ask them, "Can I use your phone?" It's not hard.

So. Let's look at a couple useful features of the wonderful i-Series 
fone system.



Call Forwarding


Probably one of the most useful (in-my-opinion) options on the 
i-Series phones is the "Call-Forwarding" feature and Call-Forwarding
Off-Premise feature. The i-Series phones have quite a few options 
when it comes to call-forwarding. You can forward your calls to 
voicemail, forward your calls to another extension, or forward to 
an external number. Call-forwarding also ties in with the 
Do-Not-Disturb (DND) functions of the phone. 

Call-Forwarding

There are a couple call-forwarding modes. They are:

Call-Forwarding when Busy or Not-Answered

Call-Forwarding Immediate
  -immediately forwards your call using the given method
   without ringing the line at all

Call-Forwarding when Not Answered

Call-Forwarding Immediate with Both Ringing
  -immediately forwards your call using the given method, but still 
   rings your line.

Call-Forwarding to Voice Mail


If you needed to active call-forwarding on a i-Series phone (once 
again assuming physical access), simply dial:

1.	[*] + [2]

2.	Dial Call Forwarding condition:
	 1 - VoiceMail
	 2 - Busy or Not Answered
	 4 - Immediate
	 6 - Not Answered
	 7 - Immediate with Both Ringing
	 0 - Cancel Call-Forwarding

3.	Then dial the extension, Voice Mail master number, or 
	simply press the [Voice Mail] programmable key (if there
	is one.)

4.	Dial Call Forwarding Type
	2 - All calls
	3 - Outside calls only
	4 - Intercom calls only


So, overall, if you wanted to say...forward all your calls 
immediately to extension 555, you would dial:


[*][2] + [4] + [5][5][5] + [2] + hangup




Call-Forwarding Off-Premise


Call-Forwarding Off-Premise can be used to forward your calls to 
another number. There are quite a few different ways to exploit 
this feature, assuming local access at an i-Series fone.

To turn on Call-Forwarding Off-Premise, dial:


1. 	[*] + [2]

2. 	[6] + Dial line access code


{    Line access codes are:

[9]   Automatic Route Selection (ARS) / Trunk Group Routing
  Dialing "9" for an outside line is probably the most common 
  way known by people using PBX systems to get an outside line.
  "9" is the extension commonly designated for Automatic Route
  Selection - the fone system chooses what line you are going 
  to use for you.

[8][0][4] + Line Group (1-9 , 01-99, 001-128) 
  804x dialing is Line Group Selection dialing. You can manually 
  select the outgoing trunk group that you want your call to be 
  placed via. For example, if there is more than one business at 
  in your office, you might have a trunk group "1" for the "ABC 
  Packaging Corp", and a trunk group "2" for the "BCD Shipping Co."
  If you were calling out using "9" on a phone belonging to the 
  "BCD Shipping Co., you would be actualliny dialing "8042". That 
  would route you onto the BCD Shipping Co. trunk group. But, you 
  could also theoretically dial "8041" to make an outgoing call 
  over the trunk group assigned to ABC Packaging. (I hope that 
  makes sense).

[#][9]	+ Line Number Selection 
  You can select an absolute line using "#9". You could dial 
  "#9" + "05" to get line number 05.
}


3.	Then dial the external number where you want your calls 
	to be forwarded.

4.	Hangup.




Call-Forwarding Off-Premises is a quick-n-dirty way to get an overnight 
extender. If you were to walk up to a Future Shop employee, and ask them 
to use their phone, you might be able to set it to Call-Forward 
Off-Premises. But, chances are that it would be noticed the next day.

If you want to maximize the length of time before the Call-Forwarding is 
removed, there are options to be considered.


Forward to the Operator.
  If you're forwarding to the operator, and then getting him/her to 
  place the call, you aren't going to be endangering your favorite bridge 
  or your friend. 

Find a remote phone that rarely receives calls.
  In large retail outlets (Future Shop, Best Buy, Canadian Tire, etc) 
  there are often departments that are lower traffic then others. For 
  example, appliances. How many people go to Future Shop to buy 
  appliances? None, you say? Well then, if you're going to pick a fone 
  to set up as an extender, might I suggest you use a phone in the 
  appliance department? Chances are, it's going to recive less traffic 
  which means less chance of your extender getting taken down.


+++


Forced Trunk Disconnection

While still on the physical access topic...Force Trunk Disconnection. 
If for any unknown reason, you needed to release a line, simply dial up the 
line using:

[#][9] + line number (ie 01, 02, 03, 005, whatever) + [*][3]

That will disconnect (read abruptly terminate) the connection. I'm sure 
you can figure out a good use for that. 



+++



Night Service Mode

Ever find a nice afterhours voicemail system that you just can't wait until 
the evening to play with? Even if it means cutting off legitimate users? No, 
me either. But, with Night Service Mode, you can do just that. Switching to 
Night Service Mode during the daylight hours, especially in a busy store, 
usually makes incoming callers upset. People calling in get voicemail. 
And such. But, it's a convenient (for you) way in a pinch to get access to 
an afterhours system. To physically turn on Night Service Mode from a phone, 
just dial:

1. 	[8][1][8] + Night Service Password
  	  The default Night Service Password is "0000".

2. 	Dial the Night Service Mode
	  0	Day mode
	  1	Night mode
	  2	Midnight mode
	  3	Rest mode
	  4	Day 2 mode
	  5	Night 2 mode
	  6	Midnight 2 mode
	  7	Rest 2 mode

So, to turn on Night Service Night Mode during the day at your (least?) 
favorite local Staples (or whatever uses i-Series) simply dial:

[8][1][8] + [0][0][0][0] + [1]

That is, of course, assuming the password is default.

Outgoing Calls


Some i-Series phone systems have toll restrictions. To override toll
restrictions, simply dial:

[8][7][5] + Password

As well, some systems that use ARS (Automatic Route Selection) are 
coded. Many larger companies like Nortel that have high volumes of 
calling often code their PBX systems so that calls can be catalogued 
effectively, and to discourage over-use and fraudulent use.

If the systems you are using is using coded ARS, when you dial "9", 
you'll get a dialtone and can dial your number as normal. But, after 
you have dialed the number, you will be dropped to another dialtone 
and will have to enter the ARS code.

Bridging and Social Engineering


Bridging is the act of placing two outside callers in a 
conference call, and then dropping out of the call.

Let's say that two of your phreak buddies decide that they want to talk.
But, maybe they don't want to pay for it. Simple enough. You just walk 
down to your local K-Mart, and find an remote phone. Then, wait for 
one of your buddies to call up the local K-Mart's 800 number and ring your 
phone. When he does, simply press the [Conf] button on your i-Series 
phone. Then, wait for your second buddy to ring your line. When he does, 
press [Conf] twice. This will connect the two parties. To drop out of the 
conference and leave the two parties talking, simply press [HOLD] + 
[#][8]. 

Now on the other side of the coin. Many companies set up conferences to 
allow outside employees such as service technicians or other field workers 
to talk to each other. You could social engineer a secretary into creating 
a bridging line to talk on. If she doesn't know how, now you can walk her 
through it, since you know. In my experience, many secretaries also refer 
to bridging conferences as "Tandem Conferences", "Tandem Trunking Lines", 
or something similar to that.

[  BlackRatchet wants to remind you that a 'Tandem Trunking Line' is not 
  a technical term. A trunk and a line are different. Not the same. He 
  really, REALLY wanted me to note that. So here it is. ]

===========>>::::Nettwerked West Edmonton Mall War Walk::::<<============
=========================================================================


So I start my journey to the West Edmonton Mall war walk in my hometown of Sask-
atoon. I'm about a 5 hour drive anyway from Edmonton so I decided whats better
than war driving while going up to the war walk. With my IBM Thinkpad T21, SMC2-
532W-B W/ dual omni 5dBi antennas running Kismet on FreeBSD 5.4, I hit the road.
Here are my results from the war drive between Saskatoon and Edmonton.

So that was my results. After a good night sleep today was DDay. I packed up
my gear and headed to the mall. I got there and remember I forgot to get more
DVC tapes for my camera for the nettwerked video project. So I phoned h4v3n on 
his celluar phone and told him that I was just at London Drugs picking up some
tapes. After 5-10 minutes waiting in line. I finally payed for my items and I
was off to the meet place. I came to see War, Alan, and h4v3n sitting down wa-
iting for people to show up. h4v3n with his sweet IBM and Alan with his REALLY
sweet Mac *drools* I plop my stuff down beside the crew and boot up my thinkpad.
I notice h4v3n trying to fix some stuff with kismet that he needed to su into
his root account to fix. So I bust out my videocamera and start filming his
keyboard. Funniest thing ever, I'm trying to hold my laugher in while h4v3n
types in the first 3 letters and then stops DEAD. He turns his head and knew 
exactally what I was doing. It wasn't like I was 'trying' to steal his pass-
word. I was just goofing around. It was a good chuckle. Anyways moving back
on topic. All of us decide to wait around for a while to see if anyone shows
up. After around 10 to 15 minutes we decide to start the war walk. No one else
showed up so it was just us four (fr0st, h4v3n, Alan, war) 

Here are my results with my IBM ThinkPad T21 (keep in mind that I can ONLY see
802.11b networks)

Connecting to Telus Digital Subscriber Carriers

-------------------------------------------------


  		 <PART I>



Howdy K-1ine readers! I came across some pretty cool
and interesting shit while phreaking around my town
that can be useful if you know what you're doing.

I'm still doing some poking and prodding with these
Telus digital subscriber carriers, seeing exactly
what can be done, next issue I hope to have Part II
finished, with a complete list of terminal commands
and more details.



City                    Carrier #

Bon Accord 		921-2308

Chipman			323-2310

Fort Sask		992-2308

Lamont 			895-2311

Radway			736-2311

Redwater		942-2311

Smoky Lake		656-2316

St-Michael		896-2309

Thorhild		398-2317

Warspite		383-2308

Waskatenau		358-2308



I've only been able to find the numbers for these cities,
though I hope to gather more in due time. If you come
across any of these carriers please e-mail me at:
tr00per@sdf.lonestar.org and I will add them to the list.

You're probably wondering ..how the fuck do I know if its
a Telus DS carrier?

You'll find as you dial these numbers, (the local ones for
sure anyways) that it just drops you a dial tone, and a
there's no modem on the other end. I guess it's like a
security feature to guard against wardialing etc, but you
can tell its a telus security feature, because it sucks.


To bypass the dialtone and get a modem connection you need
to "flood the line"


To do this, follow these 3 steps:


1. Dial the number

2. When it drops a dialtone, hit flash, and right away dial
   the number again.

3. This time it will ring, and as soon as the eslut voice
   starts saying "You've just dialed a number that etc..."
   Hit flash again and dial the number. This time the line
   will ring and a modem will answer.


To uncomplicate things, I suggest setting up your terminal
program (Netterm, HyperTerminal..) to dial an empty number
(Instead of writing a number to connect to, put a few commas
instead).  This way the modem just sits and listens for a 
connection while you do the steps.

Read the next issue for Part II for further info on logging
in and commands.

Sir,
My name is Kris Lenning, I am a SGT in the united states army and I currently
work with networking and computers. I have recently been asked by my supervisor
to hack and remove a webpage from the internet. I am not able to do this and I
am trying to recruit some help. Could you help me or point me in the right
direction to get this done.

Many many thanks

Thank you for responding, I was not sure you would. The web page in question
was taken down last night however. I do thank you again for response. I would
however like to keep your address in case anything like this happens again. As
well, could you point me in the right direction as to learning how to do this
myself. I know a lot of programs out there boast of being able to do this but
none ever realy seem to work. I know a lot about networking and a lot about
computer systems and software but I have never gotten into the "hacking or
cracking" thing too much. usualy if I need the software or the webspace, the
army gets it for me. Any way, again I say Thanks.

Pheno,

I may have spoken too soon, this morning when I went to the address it came up
website not found. Now, however, it is up and running again. the web page is

http://www.aaenvironment.com/mozon/mozon4.htm

The reason for it is that the Chaplain that posted it put some information in
it that was never supposed to be released. I wish I could explain more but I
hope you understand. We still have not been able to contact him to have it
taken down so if you could help please. It realy does need to come down as
soon as possible. and could you send me an email letting me know when it is
done.

Again, many many thanks

Kris

Hello again.

You'll have to pardon the delay with which this email is sent, I have been busy
with a .. project.

I've inspected the address you've sent me and it shouldn't really be a problem.
However, I do not know if you have heard of "hacker ethics" .. it is what
prevents me at the moment to act. I need more information as to why exactly the
page must be taken down, so that I know my actions would be "right". I hope you
understand .. The image that the media gives us hackers of "terrorists" is not
at all true. We Too follow a moral code. So, please send the information I've
requested.

You've said you'd like to learn how to take down pages on your own. Of course I
would be more than happy to point you in some directions, as to what things you
should learn etc. However, as any teacher would do, I must first enquire about
your current knowledge. The following information would help me make an image
of what information you already posses, so that I may more efficiently help you
fill in the gaps:

- What is your education [what school(s) & university(s) did you attend]
- How large your experience with computers is
- Your age

Also, this has been on my mind for a while: normally, taking down a page from
the internet is a crime .. is your supervisor aware of this ? I am not very
familiar with the military system of the USA. Are people inside it allowed to
take down pages from the internet ? (just a curiosity)

Anyway, I hope you'll get back to me with the information I've requested really
soon so that I may get to work..

I understand that you are busy and I understand that you have ethics as well.
Ok here is the scoop, The Person that posted the page is an Army Chaplain, now
we have a way of taking the site down but if we do that in means contacting a
department that is higher up and will result in him getting in a lot of trouble
over something he has done unintentional. Some of the information on the page
that is not allowed includes talking about flight schedules, the runway the
planes landed on and any information about the base itself in Manda Bay area.
To the enemy that base does not officialy exist. So you can see that if this
gets reported higher to be taken care of, He could be in real trouble and
possibly loose his commission and be kicked out.

My imidiate command, i.e. my supervisor, his sup., and his sup. all had come to
me to see if I was able to take it down to keep him out of trouble. Now I know
this is usually concidered a crime however if it had been me doing it or
someone like me in the miliitary for security reasons then no, we would not get
in trouble for it.

As for me, I am 32yr old, I currently maintain two networks for the army. I
have been working in networking for going on 6 years. Most of my knowledge of
computers and networking has been self taught but I am currently going to
school at Nova University via the internet for Computer informations systems
technology. Like I said before, I know a lot about the systems, I have been
running a small computer repair shop out of my house for going on 7 years. I
do know quite a bit about the networking, but every day is a learning
experience. I have just started learning about biulding webpages from HTML and
by using a couple different programs like Front Page and such.

Please if there is anything more you would like or need to know, feel free to
ask.

                    CES: THE SCIENCE AND THE CONSPIRACY

HISTORY

Research on using Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) for treatment of
anxiety began in the former Soviet Union during the 1950's. Its primary focus
for development was for the treatment of sleep disorders, hence its initial
designation as "electro sleep." Treatment of insomnia was soon overshadowed by
psychiatric application for depression and anxiety. Since then, it has been
referred to by many other names such as transcranial electrotherapy (TCET) and
neuroelectric therapy (NET).

CES quickly caught on in East European nations and its use has slowly spread
worldwide. CES has been used internationally now for more than 50 years.
Thousands of people worldwide continue to benefit from it. The most extensive
work on CES continues in Russia at the Pavlov Institute in St. Petersburg.
Current estimates are that there are between 50,000-100,000 units in use
worldwide. No negative effects or major contraindications have been found from
the use of CES.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

CES uses an electrical current with 0.5 Hz square-wave which is bipolar
asymmetric (reverses polarity with every wave). Maximum current is generally
1000 microamps or less. This output is readily generated with a "frequency
generator", a common piece of test-equipment found in any electronics lab.

HOW IT'S USED

It's quite simple. Current is directed through dermal contact to travel
transversely through the cranium. In other words, you attach the ear-clips or
contact pads to your earlobes or to the skin on the base of the skull right
behind your ears. Apply the correct current as outlined in the previous
section, and slowly turn up the amperage to a comfortable level. A session is
usually between 20-40 minutes and the results often last between 12-48 hours.

HOW IT FEELS

It feels a lot like being drunk while you're using it. It throws your balance
a bit and makes you feel a little spaced out. Once you've finished a session a
feeling of calm relaxation comes over you. It can be just a little euphoric,
but really more relaxing, centering, and putting you at peace with the world.
These after-effects usually last for at least several hours if not several
days. The after-effects are not impairing at all.

So why does it do this? This particular configuration of electrical current,
when applied through the cranium, actually causes neurotransmitter activity to
re-balance itself. Stress causes our neuro-transmitter levels to become
unbalanced, CES causes them to re-balance, so as a result CES can be used to
treat and/or cure many stress-related illnesses. If you want a more scientific
answer than that please feel welcome to hit the search engines and read the
myriad of medical research available.

One other effect, which is really a side effect due to the proximity of the
region of stimulation to the optic nerves, is that while you are using it you
will see bursts of light in your peripheral vision. These light bursts
(phosphenes) pulse along with the 0.5 Hz frequency of the CES signal. I
speculate that this is simply a result of the electrical current causing
excitation of the retina or optic nerves, which in turn causes the phosphenes.
No big deal. There is no harm being done and they are actually quite
interesting in their own right. The higher the amperage of the current the
more visible the phosphenes are.

We've also noticed that it doesn't seem to work on females. We can only
speculate as to why this may be. But it is a fact that women's brains are
wired very differently than men's (gray matter versus white matter). So that
may be a contributing factor. Who knows? However, studies state that CES is
effective on about 95% of people who have used it. So I guess it must still
have the same neurotransmitter balancing effect on women, just without any of
the other fun side effects.

And finally it should be noted that the effects tend to be cumulative. The
more times you use it, the more you will notice that your brain tends to keep
itself at a relaxed and non-stressed state.

TREATABLE MALADIES

The list of treatable maladies is very extensive, and new ones are being
discovered all the time. I will list a few of the most well known ones here
and will otherwise leave it to the reader to do their own research if they are
inclined. Entering "Cranial Electro-Stimulation" into any search engine yields
a tremendous amount of links to further data and scientific studies on the
subject.

Depression 
Anxiety 
Insomnia 
Addictions (alcohol, street drugs, nicotine, prescription drugs) 
Stress 
Migraine and tension headaches 
Chronic pain 
ADHD/ADD 
Improve memory & concentration 
Chronic fatigue syndrome including fybromyalgia 
Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) 
TMJ dysfunction 
Performance anxiety 
Panic disorders 
Tic dolereaux 
Bruxism 
Stress induced asthma 
Hives 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Ulcers or gastritis 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
and so on... 

CONTRAINDICATIONS

There simply are no real contraindications resulting from the use of CES.
Persons using pacemakers or other embedded bioelectrical devices should consult
a physician before using CES. With 50 years of use, hundreds of research
experiments, and hundreds of thousands of users, CES has been demonstrated to
be 100% safe.

THE CONSPIRACY

CES has proven to be an effective cure for many of today's most common
ailments. Stress, insomnia, anxiety, depression, "ADD/ADHD", and narcotic
addiction can all be inexpensively treated and cured with CES. Why isn't
everyone using it?! To answer that, one must first ask, "Who stands to benefit
by holding back this technology?" The answer should be immediately obvious...
the major pharmaceutical manufacturers of course. The peddlers of Ritalin,
Paxil, Celexa, Prozac, Methadone, Xanax, Valium, Zoloft... and the list goes
on and on and on. There are literally hundreds of varieties of these drugs
being taken by millions of people daily. That's a lot of money. Billions of
dollars per year in fact. If you were running a racket like that would you
want some cheap and effective solution to millions of peoples pain getting in
the way of your profits? Would you care that many of your "treatments" often
do more harm than good? Would you be more interested in getting people hooked
on your drugs forever rather than trying to cure them? Would you be evil and
gluttonous enough to put money before people's health and well-being? Judging
by the actions of the companies responsible for this booming industry the
answer to all of these questions is a resounding 'YES'.

There is a mountain of evidence indicating that the US government is the
biggest drug pusher on the planet. Many people suggest that the entire US
economy is being propped up by the US government's importation and sale of
heroine and cocaine to their own people. The details and evidence to prove
this are far beyond the scope of this article. If you are so inclined though,
you should be able to find plenty of proof on your own. Suffice it to say; I
have seen enough evidence that I firmly believe this to be the truth.

There is over 50 years of research and hundreds of published medical studies
that have proven conclusively that CES is both safe and effective. So why are
people still being force-fed expensive and ineffective pharmaceuticals to
treat these common ailments? Conspiracy? What other explanation is there?

WHERE TO GET IT

At the time of this writing the only place to get an unused original Voodoo
Magick Box unit is from www.nettwerked.net for an all-time low price of $50.
There are other commercially available CES units in production, but depending
on your countries laws, you may or may not be able to procure one without the
consent of a physician. Furthermore, current commercially available CES units
are rather expensive costing hundreds of dollars.

There is one other option besides building your own. Many of the currently
popular electronic muscle stimulators (TENS units) have a setting to output
the needed 0.5 Hz square wave and work very well as CES units. The self-
adhesive pads tend to work pretty well in place of the more traditional ear-
clips. In fact, this is what the Voodoo Magick Box Model II was (second
revision of the 2 person model) before Voodoo Machine closed up shop. These
TENS units can usually be purchased for $100 or less and can be found at a
variety of places including drug stores and "everything you've seen on TV"
stores.

CONCLUSION

At Hack Canada we have done extensive research and testing of CES technology.
It works. We know many people whose lives have been drastically changed for
the better through the use of this technology. And finally, it's just a fun,
safe, and beneficial way to hack your own brain.

    Vacuum Love                                         Druid of Orange, '89
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When I have a lonely weiner, I get out my vacuum cleaner.
    In the closet, there she sits. She's got a hole, but no tits.
    Gives a blowjob like no other, then cleans rugs for my mother.

                      ELECTROLUX - really sucks
                    FILTER QUEEN - makes me cream
                       SANITAIRE - eats me rare
                  BLACK & DECKER - chews my pecker
 
    Girls are such a fuckin' pain, my vacuum swallows, won't complain.
    I pump her hose down to the bag, she deep throats & NEVER gags,
    no more cum shots in my eye, cause my vacuum sucks me dry.
 
    During my last Hoover fuck, a stray bolt of lightning struck,
    my vacuum got supercharged, down the tube my balls discharged.
    I guess the suction was too strong 'cause my dick's now three feet long.
