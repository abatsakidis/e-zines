Introduction -								    
									    	
								    	
  At last the third edition to my zine is finally completed, and it's only  
been about eleven months since I've written one! 			       
									         	
This issue promises to be one of the best so far - filled an interview, 
personal writings, technical hacking/phreaking documentation by my
friends, acquaintances, and of course myself. 								  
										 
In the previous zines I didn't have much feedback by anyone, so I was forced
to do all technical and personal writing for them... tough job if you ask me.
Luckly I didn't run by anyone elses schedual but my own because hell, I really
don't give a flying fuck if you want my zine out on a quarterly basis.

Now we enter the spring of 2000; what better time to release this issue...

Cyber Renditions 

by warVamp
warvamp @ hotmail.com
03/15/2000

With the popularity of the Internet increasing at such an explosive rate.  
Information exchange is broadening and barriers are subsiding.  
Knowledge is considered power, and is a valuable resource to attain in any 
way available. 

Today millions of users access the Internet and gain knowledge available
to them. "Hackers", as they are so often referred to as, are individuals
seeking information. But there interests are not settled by the means of
the normal conventions, mediums, and teachings. They use experience and
inventiveness to explore the secrets that technology holds.  

And in this event, they are deemed unlawful and considered threats to 
businesses and even more so to society in general.
There is an underground society which is unseen and innovative. 
Where a group of individuals exist and explore, and who have made many
appearances in recent media articles. With alias' to hide there identity, 
they operate in secret. Deemed "violent anarchists" by the average uniformed 
individual, they explore the digital domain. 
   
Similar to a child in a candy store, hackers marvel at the complexity and
beauty of technology. Armed with a keyboard and a digital doorway, they tread 
lightly in a labyrinth of bits and bytes, stepping beyond the velvet ropes
and peering beyond the forbidden gateways. They desire to see past the
obvious smoke and mirrors set before the masses, and see the inner workings 
and protected secrets of society.
 
Hacker is a very broad term in present publications and media coverage.   
Considered by many to be extremists in this age of computers and technology, 
they stand apart from the average computer user. There is structure,
organization, and development which occur in this isolated faction.  

Like any social group, there are classes that divide and affiliates who
stand out. The majority of this congregation is virtually harmless with
only a driving force of curiosity behind them. But unfortunately, the 
individuals to be noticed recently are deemed destructive.

Technology today is evolving in leaps and bounds. Electronic Commerce and
the digital marketplace have reached and surpassed several pioneering stages.
But in the race for the technological superiority, security measures have
been disregarded or often overlooked. Many times only primitive measures
have been taken to protect information from the "lawful" abiders, but just
as often, security has been totally absent. Creating a secure environment is 
a tedious undertaking, and interfaces to this environment are constantly
changing, so understanding it will always fall distant to its creation.

This in turn delivers many individuals a quest to explore and exploit.  
In the past, technology has developed further to meet the needs of the 
industry. With this breech of security, hackers have helped to fuel the
creation of innovative advancement and development.
 
"Malicious criminal activity" has become the common scapegoat for so-called 
security experts. An effective way, believed by them, to easily put the blame
on the individuals they consider offenders. A "direct violation of privacy" 
and "breach of property" are considered the definitive in hacker related 
crimes. Many of their actions and nature of expression may have caused
humiliation of some "greater power", and the hackers very existence
signifies a genuine believed threat which authorities have no concept how
to control. Exposing themselves as the victim, power holders gain the
publics' sympathy and characterize these hackers as vandals.  
 
Ignorance is bliss. And for those who hold this lack of knowledge,
many opinions have been fashioned to an uneducated slander. Holding these
judgments, society has already decided the line between guilty and innocent 
before understanding the supposed crime. The voices of the blamed are
silenced and only the tainted media's vocalization give a misguided
interpretation of these misunderstood intensions.
 
The net has increasingly been transforming from a position where freedom of 
speech is dominant to one which revolves around the needs of industry.

With the advent of new technologies constantly arising, the Digital 
Underground will continue to thrive and develop. Not all hackers should
be viewed as vigilantes, nor should they be disregarded as passive.
Understanding the problem must occur before a realistic solution can be
developed.

	'She makes me wait'


  These thoughts of you,
  once fleeting,
  have come to fill my days
  with fruitless longing,
  the sterile desires of
  long-distance wishes, and
  wet dreams in a bed 
  barely large enough
  for one.


  Here is what I remember:


  a dark nightclub,
  a red streak, vertical, with bare arms like olive branches,
  the first time you smiled,
  blessings bestowed by your gilded tongue,
  nervous laughter,
  tender kisses,
  slender fingers tangled in hair.


  Then,


  tea, and
  courtesies, and
  restrained want,
  and the impersonal warmth
  of comforters and socks,
  his flesh against mine
  while you lay,
  alone,
  on the couch,


  and goodbyes -
  too brief -
  in the morning.


  I miss the dance of your eyes.

   Oh my god, vetesgirl,
   I wish you were a testesgirl.
   Sucking testes left and right,
   sucking testes, day and night.
   You are such a wrinkled hag,
   I really wish you'd suck my bag.
   I find myself quite perplexed,
   which wrinkle to stick my wang in next.         
   Pumpin' hard I drop the hammer,
   and pretend that you're my gramma.
   Finally I find a way to win,
   I pop your teeth and stuff it in.
   Oh, my chowder churns and broils,
   cuz nothing stokes me like old goils.
   As I grope your flabby bum,
   and you beg me for my hot cum,
   what I need is to feel your pain,
   I crush your skull and fuck your brain.
   Bumping tissue harder, hard,
   oh my god, jiggling your lard.
   But alas I cannot cum,
   because you are so fucking dumb.

'Ravers' 


We are found in dark corners of the cities, rising only when the world is
sleeping.

We have found that which was tribal, deep in the shadows of our soul, and
have remembered the ritual of dance. Once, long ago, we beat our drums,
circling the firelight, and chanted beneath the sky and moon.

Still we dance.

Still we embark, as our ancient fathers did, upon the journey of the mind.

Now we gather in the nightclubs, the vacant warehouses, and in the
underground basements. Sometimes we revel out beyond the limits of
civilization, in the empty wilderness where it is secret and we are free.

We are the dancers, the dealers, the technicians.

We are the lost children who have found family.

It is the ancient ritual of gathering, the firelight replaced now by the
flickering of the strobe and the electric sweep of the laser.

And the music.

The relentless thundering of that great beast that rides onward into the
sunrise. Our guide will mold one electronic construct into another,
crouching over machines that produce sounds so enormous that the mind cannot
encompass them. Swirling, echoing, shattering the empty night, it is an
experience of the body.

It will carry us away, and we will not only hear the music

but see it too.

A K-rad Toy
the p0pe, 2000

well, Im sitting here on the returning flight from my voyage to see the
HC crew out in Edmonton. it was fun fun fun. Sunday, we decided to hit the
flea markets. now, we have flea markets back in Halifax, but you would be
very hard pressed to find any old school technology there. Edmonton is not
like that.

so me and dwr are walking around in one of the aforementioned flea markets
(which one, I don't remember) and we come across this little booth
chock-full of computers. not just any computers, but these crazy old squool
computers. we saw a couple c64's, an Atari, and a Tandy trs-80 model 100.
now, when I first started playing with computers way back when, I started
on my dad's Tandy 1000's. RCA monochrome monitor. 83 key keyboard. analog
joystick ports. all that fun stuff. I played with this and other Tandys
for quite a few years. they always have a special place in my heart.
seeing this t102 made me feel all nice and special inside. heh. hell, I
just thought it was cool that I found a laptop made in
nineteen-fucking-eighty-three. 

I paid $20 for it, and immediately had to fend off $25 offers from dwr.
I started playing with it immediately, promptly discovered that it had
a basic compiler (k-rad). upon returning to cyb's, I proceeded to look
upon the vast wealth that we know as the internet to find out what, if
anything I could do with this piece of hardware. what I found was nice.
  
first off, it has a built in 300 baud modem. now, remember when your at a
fucking payphone, chances are you ain't running too many
bandwidth-intensive applications. 300 baud is fine for wardialing, or
dialing up yer local dod w.o.p.r. or whatever.

the second cool thing about it is also the built in modem. this built in
modem has two modes : DIR and ACP. DIR stands for Direct, which is when
you plug it directly into the phone line via the optional dongle. ACP
stands for Acoustic coupler. yes my friends, this means that with either
spending ten bucks or making the thing yourself, you have a portable
wardialer/w.o.p.r penetrator (*eg*) that runs on 4 AA batteries.

it also has some other neato things. there's a plug for a cassette deck,
as well as for a printer and, get this, a barcode reader.
as I mentioned earlier, it has a built-in basic compiler, and it has
standard 32k of memory :). according to the manuals, if you use it for
about an hour a day, you get bout 20 days out of it, if 4 hours a day, 5
days (love that math). there's also a plug for an ac adapter. and, a slot
so you can burn your own ROMs for it.

one thing that I haven't researched too much about is the BUS plug. the
thing has a 40-odd pin plug at the back used for adding such things to the
system bus as a floppy drive or an external LCD monitor. probably other
neato things if you are good at electronics and m4d basic coding.
not bad for 1983, eh?

------------ Lame Theatre Hack Text! ------------


         by: KAN0 [ http://www.internettrash.com/users/kan0/ ]


warning:: this is DEFINATELY lame... I warned you!


Picture this: 

you're in the movie theatre, minding your own business, and some
fat bitch sits in front of you, and people sit behind you who have the worst 
laughing voices in recorded history! Sound familiar? I thought as much.

Here's how you can fix that problem nice and simply every time you go to the
theatre. You have a jacket, and so does your date, right? Place them into 
the two seats directly in front of you, reserving these seats for your
imaginary friends who are only in the washroom. Make sure any person
wishing to sit in those two seats know they're 
reserved. You have to, of course, sit where there's two seats free in front 
of you, and it's easier to do the less crowded the theatre is. You could
even go as far as to place articles of clothing all around you in a
square to rid yourself of any other annoying people, but that could get a
tad suspicious. Name tags on the jackets are an idea, and so is extra 
popcorn where their seat is, to give the impression that people have been 
there before. This whole thing gets difficult when the theatre starts to
get crowded.
	
And, people please, do not use your girlfriend's bras or panties, those 
tend to me a tad conspicuous. Thank you!

			- Introduction -



   It's the year 2000 and I can say that without a doubt we are finally 
in the midst of a payphone revolution. For a greater majority of the
90's, there have been dozens of so-called "break-throughs" in the tele-
communications industry's payphone sector. 

Some of these breakthroughs helped to shape the way we live by finding
simple solutions to our complex problems by making the way we communicate 
convenient, easier, and more efficient.

One key player in the innovation of the international payphone market is
a company by the name of Elcotel Corporation (NASDAQ: ECTL).

Elcotel, based in Sarasota Florida, has rewired the Digital Age and the 
rules of marketing by creating one-on-one relationships between businesses

  Component Movement
  ------------------

  Q: "What's that crazy noise I hear when I hang up the 9520C?"

  A: That noise you hear when you hang up the phone, is simply the
     Physical Component Switch (PCS) resetting the line after recognizing 
     a dialtone.

  In addition, if you were to open up a 9520C model Elcotel and look inside,
  you would see a button which operates the Physical Component Switch
  labeled 'do not press'. Hmm... I've always wondered what would happen
  if I were to press it. ;-p


   Ring Back
   ---------

     All Elcotel 9520C payphones have a built in ringer though only 
approximately 10% of them actually ring when you call them up.

A simple way to test if the 9520C phone you're using is part of the
"10% ringing bracket" is to call it (number located on the phone)
from another payphone next to it.

If there isn't another payphone close to the Elcotel, which is not uncommon
(marketing reasons), just use your cell phone and call the line up to test if
the 9520C phones nearest YOU can ring!

How many Nortel Millenniums do you know of that ring, let alone answer with
a modem carrier when you call them up? NONE.

			- Physical Administration -


Physical Administration of the Elcotel Payphone has got to be the most
exhilarating experiences in the Research and Development of the Elcotel
Payphone. Using this brand new hi-tech equipment, learning the ins and 
outs, hacking it, and documenting it all as a pioneer explorer is absolutely
incredible.

As noted in the 'Hardware Details' section above, the Elcotel 9520C
contains two alarms to help detect vandalism and to help discourage theft of 
the equipment.

The main alarm is within the actual phone itself, and if set off for a various
reason will send a distress message to the central NCC computer at Canada 
Payphone Corporation. Canada Payphone if you don't know, is our country's
lovely distributors of Elcotel Payphones. Canada Payphone, located in Burnaby 
British Columbia, will receive this distress message on their computers which 
then automatically register everything about the phone (including the 
location). 

Canada Payphone will then contact either a security company which was 
contracted by them, or AT&T security who run their data/voice lines.
Several minutes later, either the contracted security company or AT&T will
take a stroll on by to the premises and investigate the matter.
 
Big trouble for the guy who set that alarm off! :-/

--

Hired contractors for Canada Payphone routinely do physical administration on 
the phones - installing, programming them, collecting the money, and everything 
and anything that they are required to do in their job description. 

Because these contractors are usually lonely guys who have to run around all 
the time working with machines, they long for human interaction. That is
how my associate RT was able to snag some useful information. All he did
was walk up to the guy fixing the phone and started a conversation with
him.

In a calm manner, RT asked several questions about the phones which the 
contractor was glad to share with him. The information he gave RT has been
added to various sections of this document, and for that we THANK HIM. :)

Alarm PIN Information
---------------------

Disabling the alarm on the Elcotel series phones, is relatively simple. 
What you're required to enter is a three digit PIN, which if correctly entered,
will turn off the local alarm in the phone. This means that the static 
connection from the phone to Canada Payphone's NCC computer in Burnaby BC will 
be cut off. However, if you enter an incorrect PIN you'll get an error message 
on the display.


(1) How do I disable the alarm?

- By picking up the receiver on the phone, pressing #, and entering the
three digit PIN.

(2) How do I know I'm doing it correctly?

- You'll know you're doing it correctly when you see ### on the display...
the ### represent the PIN. If you entered the right PIN, the display message
will say "OK".

(3) What is the PIN?

- Canada Payphone, (being the obvious guys that they are) decided to choose
 a PIN code that would be easy to remember so they picked 'CPC' as the PIN
 code. CPC standing for Canada Payphone Corporation, wh00p. 

(4) How do I enable the alarm again?

- Pick up the receiver (if it was hung up) and type #CPC. 

- Then hang up the receiver and try to wait for at least twenty seconds
before using the phone again. Why? You have to give the phone some time
to reconfigure itself.

- You'll know you can use the phone again when you hear the components
in the Elcotel shifting.

--

Administration PIN Information
------------------------------

The benefit of Physical Administration over Remote Administration
is that you're not required to enter an ID of some sort before
entering the PIN. 

What you're required to enter is an eight digit PIN, which if correctly 
entered, will allow you to open the phones' case granting you full access
to the Elcotel's administration system.

Giving you the ability to:

- empty out the cash box 

- change screen messages

- administrate rate tables

- see how many calls were made with the phone in a given time period

- see how many days the phone has not been in use

- debit card information

- several security parameters

- etcetera

             - Elcotel 9520C Phone Seizing Problems - 


9520C Phone Seizing Problem #1
------------------------------

- On the Elcotel 9520C model phones which haven't been upgraded with the
the new "fool-proof chip" have a severe flaw;

Recently Canada Payphone decided that it would have its calls routed through
AT&T's switching system instead of their own. The reason for this may be due
to AT&T's size and ability to handle several calls without getting the 
'bottle-neck' problem like Canada Payphone may have had.

Now due to this change-over, a problem occurred with the 9520C model Elcotel's
causing a line-seizing problem. Essentially this problem would allow a phreaker
to exploit it to make as many free local phone calls as they wished.


This is how it's done:

- Pick up the receiver
 
- Enter 25¢ for the call
 
- Call someone, and be sure they hang up the telephone after the call is
  completed.

- The line will not be seized at this time, the mouthpiece will not be 
  muted, but the keypad will be disabled.

- With the receiver still in your hand, place your tone dialer on the 
  mouth piece and begin to punch in a phone number or play the pre-programmed
  DTMF tones. Either way should work successfully.

Remember that this trick will not work on ALL 9520C series Elcotel payphones.
ONLY the 9520C's that haven't had their chip upgraded to prevent this type of
fraud will work. 


  ++ Note: 

  Sometimes when dialing a number with the 9520C phone you will
  get a number that is either 'Not In Service' or 'Cannot Be Completed',
  the line might not hang itself up. In this case, you could use the
  same techniques documented above to exploit the seizing problem and
  make free local calls.

  ++

9520C Phone Seizing Problem #2
------------------------------

- On the Elcotel 9520C model phones which have been upgraded with the
  the new "fool-proof chip" have a severe flaw;

The new chips in the Elcotel 9520C's apparently fixed 30% of the phones
in Canada which allow the use of a tone-dialer to make "free local calls"
when a line doesn't seize properly. The newer chips apparently do not allow
the use of a keypad or DTMF tones in the chance that the line does not 
seize after a call is completed, thus securing the flaw.

However, there is a way around the newer chips' "security features". 
If done correctly, the trick will allow a phreaker to exploit a different 
type of line seizing problem unknown by the Telco and unrecognized by the 
newer 9520C chips.


This is how it's done: 

- Pick up the receiver

- Dial '611' (don't worry it's toll-free)

- Immediately after, press the bi-lingual button (English to French) located 
  next to the phones' keypad. If done correctly, the payphone will reset
  causing the connection through AT&T's (the CO) SS7 based switching to end.

- At this point you can use the keypad to dial any local number you wish.

- Or use a tone-dialer by placing it on the mouth piece of the 
  receiver and begin to punch in a local phone number, or simply play the 
  pre-programmed DTMF tones.

 
The only explanation I have for why the Elcotel 9520C resets the line
causing a seizing problem, is due to Elcotel's inability to develop a chip 
that prevents various types of payphone fraud. 

If Elcotel can simply keep its promise of developing so-called "fraud 
resistant" payphones by having regular security audits before they ship their 
products to their corporate customers, then they wouldn't have to worry about 
lost revenue caused by phreakers who abuse these vulnerabilities.

It's only common sense, RIGHT PEOPLE?! :)



			- Remote Administration -


In my previous document titled 'CPC; Elcotel Eclipse Smart Phone' I gave 
mention about how one could remotely administer a payphone as long as they
had the proper knowledge to do so. 
 
I briefly explained that you'd be required to have the payphones' uniquely
assigned number, the software to administer it and the ID/PIN to do so.
In the document I mentioned that once inside the system you'd have the
ability to change rate tables, change scrolling messages, turn the payphone 
on, etc.

It's been five months since that document was written, and the information
that I gave was only general and didn't give specific system details.


What have I discovered/accomplished since then? 
-----------------------------------------------

%% Payphone Numbers %%


- I now have a list of several Elcotel 9520C payphone numbers which several
people have helped me compile. At the moment I have Canadian payphone numbers 
from Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Victoria. The number of payphones 
listed so far is in the twenties, and it keeps on growing.

The document (Elcotel CPC 9520C; National COCOT Number Compilation) can be 
seen by visiting: 

http://home.edmc.net/~theclone/Elcotel/elcotel_compilation.txt



%% Software %%


In December of 1999, I started to get into the software side of it all
and posted several different Remote Administration programs on Nettwerked
for download. The programs made it easier for the phreak and hacker to
get into the core of the Elcotel system without worrying about having to
search for them. 


PNM Plus is a simple stripped down Administration Tool which can be used 
on the Elcotel. The minimum requirement however is that you have Windows
3.11. 

Download: http://thehomeworkpage.tripod.com/pnmdemo.tar.gz

-

PollQuest Version 1.6.0 (Commercial Release) or 'International Payphone 
Network Management System' is a nice full software package (beta) used for 
administering the Elcotel, and is the default program used on the 9520C
models.

* Pronet - http://www.protelinc.com/PROTELInt/pronet/fpronet.htm
* Telelink - available for download at http://www.ernesttelecom.com


%% Remote Administration  %%


ID --

  When connected to the Elcotel Payphone remotely, you'll be prompted
for an Identification number. Now from what we're aware of, the ID numbers 
are assigned differently in accordance to the location of the payphone.

Also, from what we were told by Elcotel installers (they're great for insider
information) the Elcotel Remote Identification numbers range from 8000 and
up. Knowing this, we can presumably say that all ID's are programmed to be
four digits - or at least four digits by default.


PIN --

  One hunch I have is that the PIN alpha-numeric codes used for Remotely 
Administering the Elcotel payphones are exactly the same number of digits (8) 
one would be required to enter if they wanted to carry out Physical
Administration.
 
Remote Administration PIN codes using a Canada wide default, are programmed
into all Elcotel Payphones? 

Perhaps, and the assumption isn't too broad either if we consider there is
a default PIN used for physically disabling the Elcotel alarm (see Physical 
Administration). 


%% Software Options %%


Previously I gave reference to Rate Tables, but the information given was
a tad too general and didn't talk in enough detail to help the reader
clearly understand what they'd be in for once they connected to the
payphone remotely.

Below is the actual table options from one of the many Remote Admin Software
C programs accessible and fully available on my preliminary archive:

http://home.edmc.net/~theclone/2nd_gen/c_files/c_scripts.html

</Cut phong1.scn>

Browsing over this table, we see there are so many different options.
Not only that, but the options available are surely useful for anyone wishing 
to collect information on Canada Payphone customers.


		- Central Administration Computer(s) [9520C] - 


  All Elcotel 9520C series phones are pre-programmed to collect statistics
about the amount of money they made, how many calls were placed (and for
how long), how many days the phone has gone without use, and so on.

You'd wonder how Canada Payphone would get this information, right?

What they have done is programmed all the 9520C Elcotel's to directly
send all its statistical information to the headquarters of Canada Payphone
via modem - 14.4 data-transmission twice or more a month. 

The headquarters, in Burnaby British Columbia, have a central administration
computer (or computers) which store the history every 9520C payphone statistic
ever generated within Canada.

If you were wondering what specific number the payphone calls in order to send 
the statistics, the carrier number is (604)-717-6532.

When you call that number up with the Elcotel 9520C phone, you are given a
credit of between 5-20 cents - on the display timer which usually counts
the number of minutes a user is on the phone was instead counting down
from 40 minutes.

Which brings me to the assumption that the maximum amount of time it takes 
for the 9520C to send all of its statistical information to the HQ is 
approximately 40 minutes in length.

			   - Upcoming Projects -


In the upcoming months you can expect me to be involved in several Elcotel 
projects, which for the most part will coincide with topics or past projects 
written in this documentation.

The upcoming projects in this section are only a general idea of what is
to come in the near future. My ideas and plans change without warning, meaning 
that I cannot guarantee anything that I boast about in this section.  


` Audio samples to be added to Nettwerked [The Clone]

` Elcotel Central Administration datatapping (A "how to" manual) [The Clone]

` Miscellaneous Elcotel information to be added to this document [RT/The Clone] 

` "PROJECT: Elcotel 9520C skan of (780)-420-9XXX" [The Clone]

` + much more!


				- Credits -

  I'd like to personally thank my associate 'RT' for working with me
to learn everything there is to know about the Elcotel series phones,
and of course for his contributions to this file.



				- Conclusion - 


  In conclusion, I'd just like to note that this document will be updated
periodically as I learn more about the Elcotel payphones' architecture and
its security parameters. As Elcotel Telecommunications develops more 
technically advanced communication devices (ie. GrapeVine - 05/00),
you can be damn sure I'll be the one hacking it and writing another 
document to share with the rest of the phreaking community.

Conclusion --


Another Zine successfully completed... though what really is success?
Is success mearly in the eyes of the successor, or is it something deeper
than that? 

I mean, at first I'm always satisfied with the way my document or zine
looks but months later I look back at it and the feeling of "success"
quickly disappears - it's sad really. 

After I edit this zine, I'm never reading it again...


				THE END


(yeah yeah there will be another K-1ine issue (#4) coming whenever;
 so until then... don't play with your food or your wiener.)
