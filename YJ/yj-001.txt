 01 (the big hello to ya'll)

 well i thought i would start a text zine. so here it is. and i just wanted
 to say hello to all of you before i got into the big bull crap story of what
 i'm doing here with the text zine and all that blah blah blah stuff you
 probably dont really care about.

 before i get to far, i wanna greet a few people that i know.

 here it goes:
 hi trip, woolf, ashley, delta astro, shakespeare, freak, clark, misfit,
 belial, cerkit (yer such a wonderful guy!@), mogel (i dOnt phear u!@),
 kamikaze, balls wilson, my left nut (the girls really like sucking it!@),
 my mama (she funding my zine, with that big fifty cents she gave me fer
 lunch today!@), my daddy (he's pretty cool), and everyone else that i've
 talked to on the internet or on a bulletin board.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 02 (what this text zine is about)

 hmm. probably half you smucks out there are saying what this text zine is
 about and 2/3 of the other half dont really give a flying fuck. and the
 last of you are probably too busy wanky yer funky monkey right about now.

 well. if you like it or not, i'm still gonna tell what i'm doing here and
 why i write what i write.

 i'm a normal person. usually self contained and sometimes shy, espically
 when i first meet a person. but i'm not a total loser or anything. i
 dont speak that often, at least not when something that i dont really care
 about is being talked about. that is one reason i'm writing this. i talked
 about the things i wanna talk about and the things that come to my mind,
 while i'm sitting in this nice comfortable computer chair.

 also, some people might call me a dick, asshole, or their enenmy. cerkit
 can justify for this one. i really aint an asshole, i'm just your normal
 guy, but i go out and try to get people to view things in my way or a
 different way that they arent use to. and some people arent use to that,
 which you might call them narrow-minded. another reason i'm writing this
 crap in this text zine. i want the readers to learn or expand your minds.

 i know text zines are suppose to be phun and all. thats one reason i'm
 writing this thinger. but you have to expand your minds and get somewhere
 with your life. cause most of you are probably in high school, college, or
 just graduated from one of those. well, learning goes outside of the
 classroom and it as constant mental process.

 now go tell your mom this:

 woa!@ mommy, i just learned something new from this text zine called the
 yellow journal.

 then your mommy says 'what did you learn honey?'

 i learned that everything you do is a constant learning process.

 then your mommy says 'wow. your actually learning something these days.
 i am very proud of you. lets go get your something special.'

 well if you do this and she doesnt give you a reward for learning something
 new (like it really hurt you anyways) i'm not repsonsible for any actions
 carried out by your parents, espically your mommy.

 well some of you readers might be saying, that is the stupidist name in the
 world to pick for a e-zine. probably is, but i dont care, because it has
 some meaning to it. the most stupidist reason is because i write the text
 zine in turbo pascal 7.0 and the text is in yellow. and it is basically like
 a journal for me, tell express my feelings, thoughts, and anger. and the
 better reason and probably first reason is that there was some famous
 publication back in mid to late 1800's and/or early 1900's that had the
 title of 'yellow journal'. so i said to myself. woa!@ that sounds cool and
 the rest is history, cause you know what the name is and i dont have to
 repeat it again.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 03 (language)

 well. this zine might have a few bad words here and there. but i figure that
 i'm 17 and mature and responsible for my actions and can take the punishments
 or reactions that come with it. so i will continue to use the language that
 i use. i'm trying to cut back, but sometimes it is just fun to throw in a
 couple bad words here and there to spice up things. and some of the cuss
 words come with anger, disgust, and disrespect.

 i'm sorry if you dont like the language in here. but if you dont like it,
 then maybe reading the 'yellow journal' isnt the right thing for you to
 do at the time. come back when you can take it and maybe you are mature
 enough and can handle it. sorry if this causes you problems. but i figure
 most of the people that will reading this thing, dont really care, and use
 foul language in every other sentence if not every sentence. but that is
 not for me to judge.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 04 (little kids)

 i believe i was raised right. my parents did a good job. but i've learned
 things here and there, kids shouldnt do, but they do them anyways. so thats
 that. but i've seen kids start cussing at a younger age. disrepsecting there
 parents or elders. they cuss out peolpe. talk trash. beat up people just
 for the fun of it. and remember this is still at a young age, maybe lets
 say 7 or 8 to 10 or 12 years old. it is okay for a 12 year old, sometimes.
 but some kids i meet dont mature until there around 15 to 17. i probably
 matured early, like 13 or 14. this was probably because i was an only
 child and lived life hard and had to work for things that i wanted. and i
 still do.

 anyways. there are kids out there saying things to people that shouldnt
 be said. that even i wouldnt say or most people would. i know i never
 said those type of things like that at that age. and then sometimes those
 kids get their butts kicked in and they wonder why. because they are just
 plain out smart asses. simple as that. if some little punk ass kid came
 up to and thought he was all bad and started cussing me out and wanting to
 fight. then i would give him a fight. mess around with his mind for a
 little bit then beat the living shit out of him.

 to think that some of these kids, if they live through all of the ass
 kickings, will be our future. they will run our country. will our future
 in america go down the shitter and our country be ruined forever. will
 there be a turning back after that. only time will tell. but we can
 shape the countries future, by teaching these kids right from wrong and
 giving them a few beatings when they act like a ignorant fool.

 05 (anayzle 'hurt')

 i'm going to try to anaylze a song called 'hurt' written by trent reznor
 of nine inch nails. yes!#@ part of the song was write after the title part
 of the text zine. the part that was quoted at the beginning of the e-zine.

 here is the entire song 'hurt', line for line, in correct order.

 i hurt myself today
 to see if i still feel
 i focus on the pain
 the only thing that's real
 the needle tears a hole
 the old familiar sting
 try to kill it all away
 but i remember everything
 what have i become?
 my sweetest friend
 everyone i know
 goes away in the end
 you could have it all
 my empire of dirt
 i will let you down
 i will make you hurt
 i wear my crown of shit
 on my liar's chair
 full of broken thoughts
 i cannot repair
 beneath the stain of time
 the feeling disappears
 you are someone else
 i am still right here
 what have i become?
 my sweetest friend
 everyone i know
 goes away in the end
 you could have it all
 my empire of dirt
 i will let you down
 i will make you hurt
 if i could start again
 a million miles away
 i would keep myself
 i would find away

 woa!#@ that is some deep stuff. well at the beginning of the song, trent
 is talking about moving, maybe hurting his own self and taking his life,
 because of hurt, pain, agony, and mental toughnesses that have been
 brought apon him prior to him writing the song or things that he expirienced
 in his entire life prior to writing it. this we cant know, unless he comes
 out and tells us for his self. and it could still not be the truth. that is
 the amazing thing about life. then closer to the end he finally realizes
 that he can make a change, during around his life, go through the pain
 and one day over come not matter what it takes, besides elimnating himself.
 this songs shows what many people feel in their life. some over come the
 problem and some come theirselves. which isnt really good. cause you
 coudlnt read another 'yellow journal'.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 06 (motivation speakers)

 well, today we had an assembly. days before, i heard that we were having this
 thing. i heard there was going to be a speaker there. big woop!@ i wasnt happy
 happy joy joy or anything. but i was glad i was getting out of class and
 going with the a.m. assembly schedule. anyhow!@ this speaker looked like danny
 devito. and he even mentioned his own self looking like him. he was funny as
 hell and motivated you, by telling true to to life stories. he cared about
 teenagers and doesnt want the 'generation x' going down the drain. he says it
 only takes one person to make our generation different. that is true. but who
 will that person be. could it be you, your friend, my friend, or even me.
 maybe, maybe so.

 but something has to be done. that is one reason i try to take a serious side
 to this text zine, even though i know many people wont even read this text that
 i type on my computer. i express my feelings and thoughts and release them in
 this e-zine and hope that someone will read them and understand and change
 there life somehow. i guess you could compare me with this motivation speaker
 that came to my school today.

 i'm funny (sure whatever big hurt!@), i'm attractive (snap out of it, yer
 dreaming!#), and i try to get my point across. i try to tell true to life
 stories. things that matter. things that come to mind. but the person that
 will make the difference to our generation, 'generation x', is someone that
 is kind, cares for everyone, believes people can do things, a good speaker,
 is motivated and can motivate others, a dreamer, and someone that knows what
 needs to be done and takes charge a situation.

 we've seen this person come out of other generations. jackie robinson,
 martin lurther king, john f. kennedy, ronald reagan, and many others. and
 i believe that person will come along and i believe that person can be you,
 if you apply yourself to your dreams and goals and focus on the steps that
 will bring your closer to that big dream in the end.

 07 (glycerine by bush)

 yes, i'm putting a song by another band in here. i have my own band. we
 really dont have a name of yet. we have songs written by me, which i shall
 put in here someday down the road and maybe a few this issue, if feel that
 you've been a good little boy or girl.

 but here we go with the song. not like you really care, unless you fans of
 bush like me. i'm not the biggest. but on with the show.

 'glycerine'
 by bush

 must be your skin that i'm sinking in
 must be for real cos now i can feel
 and i didn't mind
 it's not my kind
 not my time to wonder why
 everything's gone white
 and everything's grey
 now you're here now you're away
 i don't want this
 remember that
 i'll never forget where you're at
 don't let the days go by

 i'm never alone
 i'm alone all the time
 are you at one
 or do you lie
 we live in a wheel
 where everyone steals
 but when we rise it's like strawberry fields

 if i treated you bad
 you bruise my face
 couldn't love you more
 you got a beautiful taste
 don't let the days go by
 could have been easier on you
 i coudln't change though i wanted to
 could have been easier by three
 our old friend fear and you and me
 glycerine (repeat)
 don't let the days go by
 glycerine

 i needed you more
 when we want us less
 i could not kiss just regress
 it might just be
 clear simple and plain
 that's just fine
 that's just one of my names
 don't let the days go by
 could've been easier on you
 glycerine

 woa!@ try to understand it. actually, i believe he is talking about a
 relationship that he was in. but i cant say, since i'm not him or whoever
 wrote the song. i think gavin rossdale that lead singer wrote it, but
 take my word for this one.

 08 (baseball)

 okay. i sent my second letter to the arizona diamonbacks. yes the new baseball
 franchise in the city of phoenix in of course arizona. can we say a big duh!@
 so i sent it on the 26th, but wrote it on the 25th and then go it back on
 march 1 and it was post dated the 28th and it was a hand written note. saying
 that he would send my letter on to the scouts along with my teams schedule.
 meaning that i might be playing in the pros some day.

 but i was thinking, why limit myself to just one team. i can send letters to
 all of the teams. its not like i'm signing a conctract, at least yet. so
 later this week or so. i'm going to start typing those letters out in my nice
 microsoft word version 6.0 and send them out in the mail when i get a chance
 and can bum a few stamps off people walking down the street.

 just to fucking bore you even more. i play pitcher, i have three different
 fastballs, different speeds of a curve ball, a hard slider, split finger,
 and nasty change-up. woo. be bored even more. i've pitched the most so far
 out my whole team and my name will be in a local paper, saying how good i
 will to the team or have a major impact on the team if i'm healthy and all
 that crap.

 i think you get the point. so that means we can move on to the next artcile.
 yes, be joyed, be relieved, and you deserve to be fucking happy, cause i said
 you can. and thats all you need to know.

 09 (ozzy concert, part 1)

 i'm going to the ozzy osbourne concert tonight. big deal. it will be my
 first concert. korn and the deftones are also playing with him. it should
 rock. and i cant wait until my baseball game is over so that i can get my
 ass home. get some grub. take a shower and get my ass over to my friends
 house, good around, and then leave for the concert that starts at 7:30 p.m.
 at the blockbuster desert sky somewhere in phoenix, arizona. i hope it is
 arizona, cause i know i wouldnt go out of state to just watch a concert. my
 mom would cut my guts out and eat them in front of me, if i even planned on
 going to a concert out of state.

 well, when i get back from the concert tonight. i shall feel you people in
 about how it went and my new expierences. and i cant wait until i get there
 to mosh my head off. which i just might do, if i ferget to attach it.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 10 (pornos)

 no. i'm not about to do a review on pornos. but more talk about it. let see
 i'm 17. i've gotten my hands on playboys since i was 12 or 13 and have seen
 a few penthouses of my friends. then i've seen so much porno pictures off of
 boards and the internet. it is so amazing how easy you can get access to them
 even when you are just a teenager and shouldnt be looking at them.

 i believe it is okay for adults and some mature teenagers to sneek a peek at
 naked women, if they so choose to uncover their body. since that was there
 choice in the first place and then allow a photographer to shoot it and then
 release it to the public. this may or may not be with the persons premission
 in the picture, but oh well, it is released and people see it. i believe just
 showing off posses and showing that they are sexy is alright. but when you
 get little kids of a tender age is totally wrong. i've seen many child pornos
 which just upsets me to see that they have had part in this act. but then
 there are animals fucking people. that is totally nasty. those people need
 lifes. then you also get these really nasty sexual intercourse pictures. i
 think some of these are okay. to maybe learn (like people would do that) or
 if you are an adult. but no people allow these type of material to get into
 teenagers hands and even younger kids hands.

 it is non-sense. i support in anyway stopping this. teenagers and kids should
 be having fun, not looking at pornos or naked people all day long and wacking
 off while watching them.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 11 (ozzy concert, part 2)

 well this will be a three part deal. at least at this time. i just got home
 from my baseball game, which my team won, by one run in the bottom of the
 7th inning (teams only play 7 innings in high school). then i went out to
 eat lunch at arby's and had some grub. it was good. then i got home called
 my friend, paul. and asked him what is the deal with the concert. then we
 called up our other friends and they werent home. so i'm waiting for them
 to call me up or paul. but my friends wanted to leave for the concert at
 about 5 o'clock. i say leave later. and the concert starts at seven thirty.
 which means we would have a bunch of time to fuck around.

 also, i heard that korn has cancelled out for this showing. which really
 disappoints me, because i was looking forward to seeing them in concert.
 since i heard from a few people that they throw bloody things at concerts.
 which is pretty kewl. i probably woudlnt get it, since i have lawn sets,
 but i still would get to see some unlucky fuck probably get pegged with
 the things they throw.

 this brings me into the weird concert stories i've heard to date.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 12 (weird concert stories)

 okay. i've heard a few weird concert stories. not many. at least i will only
 tell you the ones that i can remember. since i'm get that disease that you
 forgot everything. fuck my life is already going down the j-jon.

 one story i heard was that there is this really satanic band that preforms
 and all that. there is a couple guys from the band that starting jerking off
 and slap there dicks across peoples faces and jizz all over them. that is
 pretty nasty. then i heard that they also threw buckets of blood on the fans.
 not sure if it is really blood, probably not, but still it could be. i'm not
 sure the name of this band, but i'll try to find it out from the person that
 told me first about what this band did on stage.

 then i heard there was some old person. might i have been one of the guys
 from the beatles or something like that. anyways. one of the guys took a
 shit on stage then picked that wet, smelly, fly infested, stink-up any
 toilet, piece of shit and chucked it in the crowd. now that is nasty.

 then there was the chick from white zombie that took out a tampon, which
 was apparently all bloody and dirty (who else knows what was on the thinger)
 and then waved it around and around and around and around and then heaved
 that bloody baby into the stupid fuckheads and hit someone.

 trent reznor the lead singer of nin, goes to concerts drunk, with a big
 beer bottles in one hand, the guitar in the other and spits beer on to the
 crowd and then throws the beer bottle at the crowd. that is one cool fucker.

 while i'm speaking about mr. reznor, i heard when marilyn manson was going
 on tour with nin, on the self destruct tour. that the lead singer of marilyn
 manson gave trent a blow job right there on stage in front of everyone. then
 i heard that trent was moanin and breathing hard.

 those are all the things that i can remember of at least the weird shit that
 has happened from the peformers of the concerts. tonite should be a new
 expierence for me and i will see different things, like people getting there
 bodies smashed in the mosh pits all over the lawn areas.

 13 (little tommy)

 this story will have material that may not be suitable for younger viewers
 or unmature readers. so please cover there eyes or dont let them read this
 article. it isnt my fault if you somehow start doing things that are in here.

 so let the phun all begin!@

 one night little tommy was sitting on his bed, thinking of things to do. so
 he flipped on the television set and decided to get ride of his boredem he
 would watch a few hours of tv.

 so he did. he kept on flipping through the stations and still coudlnt find
 anything good. but it happened like that.

 he saw them. they where sitting right in front of him. nice and firm. he
 found the playboy channel. and he found his first stiffy. he found it so well
 it managed to end up in his left hand.

 and it just happened that he also had some hand lotion next to the foot of
 his bed and ending up slapping some of that stuff on his eight inch pecker
 and rubbed it all up. so it was nice and lubricated.

 the women on the playboy channel where still bouncing up and down, having
 fun. doing there own thing, while tommy was doing his own thing.

 he was enjoying himself, when all of sudden, he started screaming and giving
 out deep moans like he was in trouble. but he was actually enjoying himself
 even more than a few seconds before. he cared this on for a good six minutes
 while still watching pamela anderson and anna nicole smith finger each other.

 when he saw that, he decided he would invade his own little pooper whole.
 but was stopped when you he releasied that he couldnt get a whole through his
 underwear. so he stopped with that and then let go of his ding-dong and
 zipped up his pants.

 i guess you could say that he wasnt bored anymore. but more satisfied with
 what he did accomplish. he found a new sport and something to do in his
 spare time. he found something to do when his girl dumps him or stops
 putting out.

 *** editor's note: little tommy is really 16 and mature teenager. you
 shouldnt do these things, unless your really lame and cant get any. if
 anyone every finds out. say that you didnt learn from this e-zine and deny
 even having your pecker in the palm of your rosie hand. even though if they
 catch you red handed. have fun and enjoy!@

 14 (march 3 day)

 the best day for me is march 3. it is a day of rejoyce. a day of joy. a day
 of fun in the sun. a day of letting things go by. and day of just kicking
 back and doing whatever i want.

 do you really wanna know why?

 a voice from under the blue tarp speaks, "sure why not, shithead."

 oooh. i'm a shithead. you should be greatful, because of me. because of every
 march 3 you get to fuck around and have some fun. because it is my birthday
 and it is more than my birthday. it is a sign that people are living and you
 can be alive and do things.

 "shut up, mr dildo."

 know we dont need to be harsh, do we?

 "well ... yes i do."

 we is that? do you think you can boss me around.

 "i'm not trying to boss you around. i'm just trying to make an ass out of
 you. so how big are your monkey balls?"

 [big hurt tries hard to hold everything back. he even tries to walk away,
 but the thing behind the blue tarp is just to annoying with his screaching
 voice. he cant take it anymore and runs towards the blue tarp and jumps
 behind it, to find out that it is his long lost evil twin brother.]

 who the fuck are you?

 "i'm yer evil twin brother."

 woa!@

 "woa!@ is right. i've been trying to find you all this time."

 really?

 "yes ... really. know we can celebrate our birhtday together for the rest
 of your life. we can have fun and just screw around and cause some chaos,
 since we are responsible for our actions and do what we feel."

 sounds like a good idea. grab me a couple pixie sticks.

 "okay. since your getting a dr. pepper, grab me one too."

 okay. sounds cool. you can have a pixie stick.

 [big hurt and his twin brother big pain got high off of pixie sticks and
 drank so many dr. pepper's until they got sick to there stomachs the very
 next day.]

 15 (ozzy concert, part 3)

 i'm a very ticked off camper. when me and my friends got out to the
 blockbuster desert sky place yesturday for the concert, they said the concert
 was cancelled. my three friends and i where really pissed off. but so was
 everyone else that was planning on watching the concert and go moshing.

 well i guess you have to give ozzy a break sometime. since they said he was
 really sick and had a big time fever and the doctor told him not to go on
 stage a perform tonight or he might cause himself to get even worse. that is
 understandable, but still i missed going to my first concert and it being the
 day before my birthday.

 well to make the night even worse. in my friends car, when we were coming back
 his transmission was giving out. so we couldnt go to fast. by the time we
 reached within on mile of our houses, we had to go under 20 miles per hour to
 even not have the car stall on us. when it did stall, we had to stop for the
 moment, then restart it a minute later. it was a pain in the butt. and when
 all this was happening i really had to take a big time piss.

 right now, i'm listing to the radio stations to find out when the concert
 will be rescheduled into his tour (if it even will be). all i know if it
 wont be reschedule, i will be one pissed off mug.

 16 (my bday)

 i thought i would let all of you know that today is a very very very special
 day to me. it is currently march 3 in the morning when i wrote this. at 7:30
 tonight i will be 17, even though i've been going around saying that i'm 17,
 but i really turn it tonight.

 i will be going out to lunch with my dad to somewhere special (i hope) and
 then get my birthday present from him, since my parents are divorced from
 each other. and then my mom still has to by mine. and she might just take me
 around town and get something. but the only thing that i've asked for is a
 bass guitar. i really want and need a bass guitar. because of the band i'm
 in needs a bass player, besides me just writing songs and doing lead singing.

 but whatever my parents get me, i will appricate. as long as it is something
 that i've wanted before and need.

 --- # ---- ! ------------------------------------------------------------- @ -
 17 (name the band)

 you see that my band needs a name. actually i'm part of two bands. yes, i
 said two bands. and to think i will most likely be playing bass guitar for
 both of them and mostly likely doing lead vocals for both of them. but i'm
 going to make a descission soon. one band might not want me to sing that
 much, just background vocals. but they seem to be the better band. but the
 other one wants me more and they all live closer and have cars for getting
 us to gigs.

 the one that wants me the most also doesnt have all of the equipment. we need
 to get a drum set, which we will be getting soon and the other guitar player
 needs to get a guitar (oops, fergot about that didnt we?).

 well i need a name. a bunch of names to choose from. any kind of name that
 sounds good for a band. i cant offer anything of yet. but maybe i'll be able
 to hook you up with something down the road. anyways, please email all ideas
 for band names to lowen@goodnet.com on the internet.

 if you dont have an internet account, then find a friend that has one and
 have them send it through mail for you. make sure you give me your handle
 or real name, so that i can include it in the next issue after the band i
 go to decides on the best name received through this.

 18 (closer by nine inch nails)

 here is another song by nine inch nails and that guy trent reznor. its
 called closer.

 'closer'
 by nine inch nails

 you let me violate you, you let me desecrate you
 you let me penetrate you, you let me complicate you
 help me i broke apart my insides, help me i've got no soul to sell
 help me the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself
 i want to fuck you like an animal
 i want to feel you from the inside
 i want to fuck you like an animal
 my whole existence is flawed
 you get me closer to god
 you can have my isolation, you can have the hate that it brings
 you can have my absence of faith, you can have my everything
 help me tear down my reason, help me its' your sex i can smell
 help me you make me perfect, help me become somebody else
 i want to fuck you like an animal
 i want to feel you from the inside
 i want to fuck you like an animal
 my whole existence is flawed
 you get me closer to god

 through every forest, above the trees
 within my stomach, scraped off my knees
 i drink the honey inside your hive
 you are the reason i stay alive

 that is the entire song as it was written. if you want to, you can try to
 understand what trent is saying line by line. but i've choosen not to try
 to anayzle this song. since i'm not in the mood and i figure that stuff
 probably bores the shit out of you, but you can learn things from it.

 19 (school)

 what is school? why do we go to school? why do student hate school? how can
 school be changed to improve the learning of the students?

 well school is a place for students to learn and socialize. we are suppose to
 learn things that we will need later on in life. this is true. we expand our
 minds at school and become smarter and more intelligent. we talk to others
 and our language structure improves and becomes stronger. our vocabulary
 becomes better, when we learn different words.

 students probably hate school for many reasons. they hate just the word
 school and quiver up and go into a corner to hide. some hate the teachers or
 the school staff there. some hate the environment and decide that it aint a
 good environment, maybe because of someone that bugs them or because of
 rumours spread about them or someone close to them. mostly it is the teachers
 or staff that dont treat them how they feel they should be treated.

 i agree with this. since i've had the problems of teachers many of times. so
 in high school you can transfer out of that class and get a new teacher that
 may be better or not.

 the way we learn needs to change. all teachers should make learning fun. make
 games out of it. you learn better that way and the pressure of doing good is
 relieved. classes also need to be shortened, because i get so much free time
 to talk when the teacher is done with a lesson. that time could be taken up
 by learning a new subject in school, but no, the people in the districts have
 to make the schedules so that people are wasting time.

 i would rather get out of school early. say 11 or 12, like alternative schools
 do. and they learn everything we learn, but in a stricter way. i'm not saying
 go to the stricter learning, but dont waste time and make every class fun to
 learn. doesn that sound like a better idea. once again the student thinks of a
 good idea for changing school.

 20 (sometimes life sucks)

 remember how today was suppose to be my birthday. big woopie, right? wrong.
 first off my dad didnt get me anything, so we went out to lunch and went
 shopping. i got nirvana mtv unplugged and baseball batting gloves. like i
 really get to bat and all i do is pitch anyhow.

 then my mom wants to go shopping. i just dont get it. i dont care what i get
 and i want the little enjoyment of opening a present, which havent been able
 to since i was like 11 years old.

 she wants to take me shopping, so i told her no i dont want anything at all.
 she wants to go before it gets to late.

 she is putting stress on me when she actually thinks it will make me feel
 better. she also got me a cake when i didnt want one. all i want is a bass
 guitar which both of my parents could have pitched in for under 70 dollars
 if they got their heads out of their asses and woke up. but no, they make
 me feel like shit on my birthday, which is suppose to be a big happy day for
 you since it is your day and not anyone elses day. just yours and they kind
 of ruined it for me.

 23 (today)

 well i was going through a fuck issue. trying to find something to read and
 came upon this. i find the information in this very true and maybe you
 should just read it and find out about today's society.

                                 Today
                                 -----

        As each day passes, the future grows dimmer. If you catch
 the news, hear radio talk shows, read the paper, you will always
 hear about a multitude of bad events that plagued the day. Almost
 everytime you hear of some tragic event, you hear of some new
 legislation or some new science that will make events like that
 less frequent, or more bearable, or something positive. Who are
 we kidding though? Two years ago the violence was thought to be
 intolerable. More and more murders were being committed, more
 prisons were overcrowding, more violent crimes were happening,
 and overall, people were saying how it would get better because
 of tougher laws, better living conditions. Look around today.
 Same thing just a different date. More murders, more gun wielding
 kids, more overcrowding, more poverty, and like usual, more positive
 notions of things to come.

        Today, I can walk out my front door, drive a ways, and
 purchase a gun. A 9mm will do, doesn't really matter what kind
 of gun it is. From there, I walk to a place with a good amount
 of people, but kind of secluded. I break out the gun, and shoot
 four or five people. After that, I rape a woman, then kill her.
 I walk into a nearby store, commit armed robbery, then walk out
 and open fire on a few more people. I then drop my gun, sit on
 the sidewalk, and put my hands on my head. After the police arrest
 me for all the crimes that I will plead innocent to, I will begin
 my first trial a year or so later. One year in a county jail,
 eating three square meals, having a roof over my head, and relaxing
 with more free time than I have ever had. Three months after that,
 I am convicted of first degree murder on the first of my victims.
 I am sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.
 A month after that I go to trial again, not appealing the first trial
 but instead, getting tried for the second of the murders. Another
 trial after that for the third, and so on. Probably after the second
 or so year, I will go to trial for the rape crime, then the armed
 robbery, and a few more murder charges. Doesn't matter that I was
 sentenced to life without parole years back, but under new law, I am
 to be tried for each of my crimes, even if a lesser crime, even if
 I have already been convicted. Now, on top of the 25,000 dollars you
 tax payers are dishing out to keep me fed for a year, you are paying
 hundreds of thousands of dollars for my trials, my public defender,
 my transportation to and from the court, and every other expense that
 I cause.

        Today I belong to Generation X. What is GX? That means I am
 imbetween the ages of 18 and 29. I am the generation after the Baby
 Boomers, and the generation before the unnamed generation running
 our streets right now. I am considered to be a member of the highest
 educated generation in America. Like many other members of GX, I blame
 the Baby Boomers for the hellish world I am forced to survive in.
 If I get a bachelor's degree, I am no longer guaranteed a job when
 I graduate. If I get a PHD, or a Master's, I face the potential of
 entering the job market 'Over Qualified'. If I blame the generation
 before me I must hear something to the effect of "It was tough for us
 to survive and make a living, no reason it shouldn't be for you too."
 Throughout my education I have been taught not to be prejudiced, not
 to be biased, and not to _stereotype_. Yet I belong to Generation X.

        Today, I must worry about everyone near me, no matter what
 they look like, or who they are. I know that at any time, my best friend,
 or a customer in the store I work at could pull a gun, and kill me.
 Urban violence no longer plagues the poor communities. Two days ago
 a man pulled a gun from his jacket enough to show the salesman and
 cashier that he was carrying, then proceeded to tell them "I am walking
 out of here with this notebook'. Indeed he did, he now owns a top of the
 line notebook computer. When I drive home, I must be careful not to make
 eye contact with anyone else around me. If I do, it might be interpreted
 as 'staring', and I must be punished. I can not yell at anyone for driving
 poorly near me. If I honk or give someone the finger, I am liable to
 wind up dead, just another statistic for the newspapers that will tell
 me things are getting better.

        Today, maybe that newspaper is right. I am no longer here on
 this planet.

 25 (childhood)

 do you remember your childhood? do you remember back when you didn't give a
 care in the world and nothing could hurt you? though it seemed that you
 would always fall down and scrap your knee and be back in the house getting
 yourself all patched up.

 well i sure do remember. when you were a kid, you didnt have to worry about
 anything at all. you got to run and run and it seemed like you would never
 get tired, then all of sudden you would get very tired and wanna stop playing.

 some things that i played when i was a kid was hide and go seek or ditch'em.
 also i played on the school and park playgrounds and make stuff in the sand.
 i would go down the slides, even though they seemed to be hot all of time.
 probably because the hot rosting sun was glaring down on the silver colored
 slide half of the time during the day.

 but when you are a kid you just dont care. you question why you got hurt
 later. too think i look around and around somedays and i see many people
 at my high school, stuck back in there childhood. it may not be a permanent
 thing, but still they are stuck sometimes in there childhood. they never got
 all of the play time out.

 which is actually good, if you like kids. but as you grow older, if you have
 to become to responsible for yourself and let that childhood be of the past.

 maybe when you are a lot older, like 20's or so, it is good to back to your
 childhood or where you were born and raised, if you have moved out or moved
 around a lot when you were a kid. if so i suggest going back to the place
 you were raised and born and try to remember the things of the past and just
 have some fun.

 i plan on doing this. and it is better than getting drunk and getting on the
 road and hitting someone head on and killing three people that you didnt
 even know. and maybe possibly killing your ownself in the process. you choose
 which one you would rather do this weekend or a weekend coming up.

 have a lot of fun, take care, and you can thanks me later.

 ***editor's note: if your life sucked when you were a kid and you still decide
 to go back to the past and you cry or tradgic things happen, i'm not
 responsible or either is Yellow Journal e-zine.

 26 (caught in a park)

 i dont know much about this, but i read some of the article and heard the
 entire story from a few people.

 well this teacher was sitting the park watching the children play. well they
 actually junior high kids. well that aint the bad part.

 the bad part was that he was masterbating while watching 8th grade girls
 playing and talking to one another.

 then there was a cop that was watching him, until he ejecuated, and then
 arrested the teacher. what the hell was the cop doing watching this man
 for that period of time. was he getting his jollies also. i guess so.

 but the teacher got arrested and now he is on trial or something and he
 also lost his job.

 well a lesson to be done is dont do this stuff. espically in a park.
 espically in public. if you must do it, do it in a dark closet a million
 miles away from the public under the sea. so that you dont get caught with
 your pants down.

 27 (american dream)

 what is the american dream? is wanting something that is out of reach. i
 believe the american dream when accomplished makes many people sad because
 it isnt what they expected.

 you go through life struggling to get ahead and make it rich and at least
 have enough put away when the time is right to retire. i believe most people
 dont ever make it to the actual american dream, but maybe their own short
 dreams or goals.

 for example, one person that has come a long way to what most people want as
 an american dream is bill gates, microsoft's president. he was once a
 computer programmer. through hard work and education and focused on his own
 small goals and where he wanted to be in the end, he made it through self
 motivation and desire to reach that end product. which is wealth and having
 his own company.

 but many people fall short of this dream. they let society drag then down and
 dont think it is possible to start from the beginning again. you can see
 people make the same mistakes again and again. they might be great, but they
 might not have motivation or the desire to move on to the next level. they
 dont want it enough. some people just cant handle all of the pressure and
 quit. some of these people just make stupid and silly mistakes that cost them
 a promotion, job, raise, or whatever might have been coming towards them in
 there future to get them closer to the american dream.

 once again people dont actually make it to the american dream, because of
 some lack of effort, the desire, or simple mistakes. that is why i try o
 even educate my own self and learn things out side of the classroom to better
 myself for something that i will enjoy and have fun doing as a job or later
 in my lifetime. that is why you should always try to have a desire for
 something you truly love and not just sit around doing nothing.

 29 (y0lk)

 for some odd reason i have this urge to stick up for the zine, y0lk, and all
 of the people that have ever wrote for it.

 who knows why y0lk is still around? to me it looks like it is starting to
 die off. but i guess creed and the other writers haven't had much time to
 put out any more.

 people say y0lk is stupid, silly, and should die. well maybe it should die.
 not really, because it is a form of entertainment and we need it damnit.
 we need y0lk. anyway, the reason started it and the reason he writes, is
 because he needs some reason to fuck around. basically he needs something to
 do to have some fun from time to time. so he sits his ass in front of the
 computer and starts writing away.

 if he put more effort into his writings they would be most likely dto's.
 maybe he might write for yellow journal someday. what do you say creed?

 31 (in a jam)

 james was not a bright kid. didnt do good in school at all. had mostly d's
 and c's and once in while he would happen to get a b or f. all that was
 going for him, was common sense.

 but one day he was driving to school, with one of his friends strapped in
 the passangers set. out of the blue, he car died on him.

 "fuck!@" yelled tony, james friend.

 "hmm," paused james, "what could be wrong?"

 "dont fucking look at me. i dont know these things. i'm getting straight f's
 in school. yer the smart one," screamed tony.

 "hush. you dont need to scream. we can work things out. and also my grades
 arent that good," said james.

 james flung his car door open and tony did the same. but tony was swearing
 underneath his breath.

 all of a sudden four guys come walking up to the car. they all surround
 tony, except for one that went up to james and was distracting him from
 what was about to happen.

 "what do you fuckheads want?" said tony.

 well that wasnt smart, espically when the guys look gangsters that have
 guns and knifes sticking out of there pockets and they are also bigger
 than him. but remember he doesnt have that much common sense.

 "nothing esay," homie number one said.

 "we just want yer money and yer clothes. and maybe this car," homie number
 three said.

 "well you aint getting my clothes and i dont have much on me. which i need
 for lunch today," tony said with a deeper voice, like he was trying to
 scare them off.

 but while on the other side of the car. james was talking with homie number
 four, which he recongizned from school. homie number four wasnt smart, but
 loved reading many non-sense type things, and always read e-zines.

 back on the passanger side the three thugs where giving tony a shit of a
 time.

 "give us the clothes and money now!@" said homie number two.

 "no."

 thug, thug, bewm, bewm, dong!@

 james was laying on the ground knocked out. the guys didnt even use any
 guns or knifes. good thing, because tony didnt have much blood left since
 he donated blood to the nearest blood bank the day before.

 they took out his wallet and ripped the clothes right off of him. they took
 his 86 dollar boots and shaved his head.

 "bastard." yelled homie number two. "that lieing bastard, he had enough
 money for lunch for the next three months."

 "look what i found," homie number one said. "he has e-zines on him along
 with warez."

 "woa!@" said homie number three. "he must be so elite. he is getting money
 for those things. he is the shit. oh well. we got his money, warez, and
 e-zines."

 the other three homies worked there way over to where homie number four was
 messing with james. james was pissed cause he just saw his friend laying on
 the ground.

 now james was mad, like when you have dog shit on your shoes and you cant
 get it off and you have to go into the house and take a piss.

 "now guys. what do you want?" said james.

 "we want yer car, yer money, yer clothes, yer jacket, and yer crusty boxers."
 said homie number four.

 "well, i'm sorry, but you cant really have my boxers. since i just took a
 dump in them." replied james. "also my i dont wanna give away my car and
 i dont feel like wearing these clothes anymore, but i dont have a spare
 change to wear."

 "who cares, we want them all anyways. no if, and, or buts." yelled homie
 number two.

 "okay. i got a deal for you. since you seemed to like all of the my
 friends previous possessions. i'll give you the latest version of satan,
 y0lk, dto and some other text zine called yellow journal. and i might just
 throw in windows 95."

 "hmm. windows 95 sucks. we'll take the rest of the things and we wont harm
 you and even shove yer friend back into the car. but you need to throw in
 something else." said homie number one.

 "well, tony's sisters are pretty good looking and there mom is like a 9. so
 i'll give you there phone number, names and address."

 "sounds good to me." said homie number four.

 "the number is five five five, zero, one, sixty-nine. the mom's name is
 joyce, the daughters names are jennifer, melissa, christin, and lisa. they
 are all good looking and have fun."

 the four thugs wrote down the information on a sheet of paper and then
 shoved tony back in the car.

 james got back in the car and drove off in the the morning.

 tony asked how he got out of the jam and he said told him what he gave them
 except for his sister and moms number. and he told him that if he hears from
 them soon, i isnt my fault.

 when they got to school. neither james or tony's teachers believed them and
 wrote them a detention for after school.

 two of the four thugs ended up going out with tony's sisters and mom. and
 homie number four ended up marrying tony's sister, christin.

 32 (computer class)

 well since i was just talking about computer class with my friend. in my
 computer class we do nothing. woa!@ that shows how good the schooling
 system is. well now that we have a sub for the next month or two, since my
 actual teacher is because she will be having a baby within the next week or
 so, we do competely nothing, cept for walk around and play games on the
 computers all day. i even wrote some of this zine on my computer in computer
 class, since i was bored.

 the sub gives three 3 points a day for doing stuff. so i did stuff at the
 end of the hour so it looked like i worked on something. other than that
 i made it look like i was helping out people.

 the sub is stupid as hell. he doesnt say anything and he walks around and
 doesnt doing anything if the kids are doing anything wrong. woa!@ arent we
 smart. but i guess he is pretty cool sub. at least he doesnt make us do
 work, he just says you dont get points if you dont do any work that day.

 i'm currently getting an A in that class and i'm just starting ques and
 stacks and it should be easy since i just did this very long project on
 linked lists, that we had to do everything that is possible with them.

 anyways, i'm pretty good a computer programming. i would program this
 zine into an emag, but i like the whole idea that i can just open my
 editor and just start typing and typing and then just add to the index
 and then release it when i get enough stuff and enough time.

 34 (erections)

 okay. this subject may seem way off the wall. but all of you males out there
 get them all the fucking time. dont lie and say that i'm a little pussy and
 dont get them. cause your probably so sick of a guy that you get them when
 you look at your sisters friends, your moms younger friends, and if you have
 a brother, you get them when you look at his girlfriend. and of course you
 get them when you see some girl that has those thingies hanging off her chest
 and have a nice tight ass and a cunt that makes you hard and jizz your pants
 as soon as you see her.

 see girls and women wonder why guys fucking rape them. i didnt do anything,
 i just said no and he didnt stop. well once a rapist sees a girl that he
 gets hard on then he wants to rape her, because of the tight clothes that
 she was wearing at the time before the guy ripped it off of her. and then
 they blame us. well maybe we shouldnt go up to them and say bitch i want you
 or not stop when they say no over and over. but i woudlnt do that shit, it
 is just a fact that most guys would do that. they get hard and want that
 chick so bad, they rape them.

 35 (a joke)

 there was three mexicans and their teacher asked them to spell EAR!@

 the first one said E - E - R.

 then the teacher asked the second one and he said E - R - E.

 and of course that is wrong. then the teacher asked the third and he said
 E - A - R.

 "correct!@," replied the teacher, "can you use that in a sentence?"

 so he busted out a joint, a took a hit, and then said, "earh!@"


 woa!@ that shit was funny. actually it is funnier in person when someone
 tells it to you face to face. i heard at one of my practices sometime
 last week. then i heard it once again today in homeroom.

 there you go and have some phun with doing it. i had phun doing them also.
 arent you glad that i brought them to you, so that you dont have to do it
 and you could save some time. some advise for you, is that you change it
 to your normal structure of programming programs and if you type in lower
 case then lower them and maybe change a few variables. i just happened to
 have my caps lock on through about half way of this, then i realized that
 it was on and left it. so sorry for the caps. but if you dont like it, then
 you shouldnt look at it. simple as that. :)

 in peoria, arizona. the school is centennial and i've been looking for a
 community newspaper called 'The Propspector'. it covers the peoria and
 glendale areas. we i've been looking in for stuff about my school and our
 team and other schools around us in our region so we know how they are doing.

 here is an article from the newspaper about our school and how we worked
 on our baseball field and built it up from almost nothing.

 volunteers 'pitch in' to rebuild field

 parents, others score run with improvements
 by rich ott, staff writer

 Centennial High School's baseball field has never looked better.

 "we're proud of it," said second-year coyote baseball coach vic dibella.
 "before we started, there was nothing here."

 the coyote baseball field has recently been given a major facelift by team
 players, coaches and numerous volunteers.

 "it has all come together and it's beautiful," said volunteer debbie
 mincenski. her son, luie contreras, is a junior on the varsity baseball
 team.

 "it was a joint effort," mincenski said. "a group of us (parents) were there
 every weeken for two months."

 the redesigning of the baseball field began shortly after the end of last
 year's season and has yet to be completed.

 "we still need a few things: a six-foot fence (right now the field has a
 four-foot fence) and a scoreboard," coach said.

 some of the changes that have already been mare are: the modification and
 installation of sprinkler systems, better infield grass, brick dugouts, a
 concession stand, an announcer/press box stand and a new three-way speaker
 system.

 "it's all for the kids," said larry stamper, father of coyote pitcher/
 shortstop l.j. stamper. "anything we do for these guys to make sure they
 stay out of trouble and have bright futures."

 stamper, like many of the players' parents, pitched in to help rebuild the
 baseball stadium with what he knows best.

 stamper is a carpenter by trade. so he built the baseball team a custom rack
 with individual spaces for every player and coach to store their helments,
 gloves, bags and equipment. the rack is inside the dugout, which the
 volunteers "put enough block into to build a house."

 the interior cabinets for the concession stand were also built by stamper,
 while the lumber used to erect the building was donated by rob mcdonald, a
 sales representative for payless cashways.

 the concession stand's exterior was finished by the team around new year's
 eve, dibella said.

 "(with the concession stand) we have done much better than we thought we
 would," mincenski said. she manages the stand during games and has made
 $60 the first two home games this season.

 the stand provides spectators with refreshments, hot dogs, candy and coyote
 baseball t-shirts are currently "sold out," mincenski said.

 all the materials used to rebuild the stadium were either dontated by the
 volunteers or bought with money dontated by the volunteers and by selling
 advertising boards.

 dibella sold most of the advertising boards that now hang on the outfield
 fence.

 "it's a 'pride' thing," dibella said about rebuilding the stadium. "these
 boys are at school to almost 6:15 every night (practicing baseball and
 helping with the rebuilding work). that's part of that pride."

 the first phase of rebuilding the stadium was adding new sprinkler systems
 and grass in august.

 "i modified the (infield) sprinkler system to get better coverage so it all
 stays green, and i put in an entire sprinkler system in the outfield," said
 joe pfeiffer, owner of arizona lawnscaping.

 pfeiffer is one volunteer who does not have any children on the team, but he
 got involved when a friend dontated a new sprinkler system for the outfield.

 "i really enjoy doing it," pfeiffer said about helping improve the stadium's
 grass. he said it may also help his business by "word of mouth."

 the peoria resident will mow the infield grass once a week, checking the
 field's condition at least twice weekly.

 other key volunteers were ed miller, doug foust, louis aguilar, chuck
 chambers and david and beverly friedman.

 "i cant tell you how many hours (the friedmans) have been here," dibella
 said.

 david friedman, whose son plays pitcher/third base for the coyotes, is
 another carpenter. he built the announcer/press box stand for the stadium
 and helped put the roof on the dugouts.

 "it came out real good," friedman said.

 "we enjoyed doing it," beverley friedman said. "we try to get people
 involved with centennial."

 centennail principle dudley butts said he is "very proud of the action the
 parents have taken and the leadership of vic dibella."

 "thats how you develop a program," dibella said. "its more than just winning
 a ball game."


 well that was about it. i thought the article was good and it just gives you
 a little insite of how good of a person i am the people on my baseball team
 are. i've spent since the beginning of november helping out almost every
 weekend if not every other. it looks great. to bad i cant include pictures
 in here. maybe i could do a few ascii ones for the next issue.

 38 (heaven and hell come to earth)

 everyone on earth hada big smile on there face and was being kind and not
 comminting a single sin. this pissed someone off. and that one person was
 the man in the red suit. satan put a smirk on a whole lot of peoples faces,
 took the candy from babies, made birds drop from the sky and made the clouds
 go in front of the sun to make it dark and gloomy.

 this was pissing of god. so god reversed the situation so that they would be
 the same before satan had to come in a ruin his little happiness trip. now
 satan was really pissed.

 there worlds broke loose on earth and nothing was going to stop them from
 battling this one out.

 puff!@ a cloud of smoke appears and satan walks out as the fire is behind
 him.

 satan: (points to god) what do you think you are doing!@ i'm so angry. i cant
        believe you are doing this. you are making these people look like a
        bunch of stupid fucks walking around with this clown-like smile on
        there face.
 god: (points back waving his finger in satan's nose) now now. remember i
      created these people that walk on my earth. you are my evil twin brother
      that was brought apon this planet and then i beat you and you were
      doomed to hell for the rest of your life. you cant tell me what i'm
      doing is wrong and you cant change my mind.
 satan: do you really think so?
 god: yes, i do!@ no one will change my mind.
 satan: okay then. then i dare you ...
 god: (interupting) ... a dare!@ ooow.
 satan: sorry. but interupting people is uncalled for and i believe you should
        say sorry to me at once.
 god: well you can go lick adam's balls.
 satan: i thought eve was already doing that for him
 god: shut up.
 satan: anyways. back to the dare. i dare you to a contest of different
        events. and the loser will be banned to hell for the rest of his
        life reigning terror on the ones that were bad when they did live
        and then the winner will be able to go to heaven and just kick back.
 god: hmm.
 satan: well what do you think of my most wonderful and excellent plan.
 god: hmm. still thinking.
 satan: well hurry up and dont keep me waiting

 god steps into his office and thinks for awhile.

 god: (talking to himself) i know i can beat satan. i beat him once before.
      this also could be a trick. he could have this thing rigged. i know
      i can beat him. i beat him before and that is why he is in hell. okay.
      i think i will be going for it. i can beat him and can beat him.

 he steps out of his office, shuts the door and walks towards satan and puts
 his hand out and shakes hands with satan.

 god: (still shaking his hand) you got yourself a deal.
 satan: (laughing) good. very good. heaven will shortly be mine.
 god: what does that mean? you arent going to take over heaven. i will beat
      you, like i beat you once before.
 satan: is that what you think? hmm. boy are you wrong. see since i dared you
        i get to make the rules up for our contest. the events we will be
        playing are these three: mercy, homerun derby, and a sprinting race
        to get to the first issue of yellow journal.
 god: damnit!@ what fuck was i thinking. i'm gonna lose. he picked two of my
      worst events. oh well. i think i can do good in the sprinting. but i
      hope i can get one over this time in the homerun derby.
 satan: i'm gonna win. i'm gonna win. (pointing and mocking god) and you are
        not. (laughs)

 someone knocks on the door. then the door opens and the light seems to move
 every step that the figure moves foward as if he controlled the light and
 the dark. could he better than both combined?

 the voice speaks, "i'm trip!@"

 trip: i've here in my hands a contract to kill at least one of you. but i'm
       going to be the referee for your contest and the one that loses will
       have to die.
 god: fuck, fuck, fuck!@ i'm screwed. first i suck at 2 out of the 3 events
      and then i get killed if i lose, which i probably will.
 satan: to bad kid!@
 trip: i'll give you both 5 minutes to both to get ready and get to the site.
       if both or just one of you arent there. i'm gonna have to terminate
       both of you. (laugh) hasta la vista baby. (laugh)
 satan: hurry your sorry wussy ass up. cause i dont feel like dieing today.
 god: i will. i dont wanna die just yet.

 satan goes back down to hell for a quick second to pick up a few things that
 he left behind and made some plans for the rest of the stuff that cant be
 cared to be brought to heaven this afternoon.

 god went up to heaven to say a quick good bye to mary and to some of the
 angels and made sure everything is okay. but he got thinking that he cant
 win in these events and he decided that he would give a speech that he would
 have to move on. he gave a long speech that lasted for about 6 minutes or
 even longer.

 a minute earlier before god was done giving his speech satan arrived to the
 site.

 satan: where is that fucker?
 trip: well it looks like you both might die today. sorry. he is late. so
       once he comes, i shall kill you both by buring you at the stake.
       good luck in your next life. oops. i forgot you wont have another
       life to live.
 god: (laughing) sorry i'm late. (laughing) oh no. i guess we both will die.
 trip: you both are terminated. hasta la vista baby. (laughing)

 this part of the story has been edited out from the original version because
 of the violence, blood, raping of god and satan, laughter, and whatever went
 on between then and now.

 trip: i'm now the ruler of earth. boy have i been waiting for this day. what
       should i do first.

 a puff of smoke appears and big hurt walks out.

 big hurt: wait a second. i believe i had the contract out on god and satan
           and that means that i'm the ruler of earth.
 trip: damn. forgot about that contract. i guess i was having too much fun.
       well if you are the new ruler of earth, then that means i want to be
       paid for the contract.
 big hurt: okay. here is your peanut and i promise when i get a chance i will
           start a "trip fan club".

 trip and big hurt walk off into the sunset knowing that they woke up today
 and accomplished something that brought them something great.

 pitches yesturday and my arm feels like jello. then i have to take a shower.
