 01 [ introduction - by big hurt ]

 okay. i'm bringing you another issue of yellow journal. this time it should
 be much better. since the last issue. i was just trying to release it by the
 beginning to mid march. then i had enough to release and i released. but this
 issue will be worked on a lot more and should be better reading with a lot
 more stories and articles. well i've got more people to supply articles for
 your reading pleasure. i'm sure something in this zine will spark your 
 interests. anyways, this zine has come a way since the lsat release. we've
 got more writers, besides myself. we've also got a offical net, called 
 jive net. the whq for jive net is vomitorium. the app is included in the
 zip this zine came in. if you didnt get this zine in a zip, then look for
 the file: jive_app.zip. it was a quicky app coded by balls wilson. also,
 we've got a new whq for yellow journal, entropy. which i will go more into
 detail later on.

 02 [ corrections - by big hurt ]

 well in the first issue of yellow journal i made a few mistakes, but the
 major one that i found was in the header it said "like putting them out.
 Yellow Journal Issue Number is released on ... " well i forgot to put in the
 issue number. but it was pretty easy figure out i hope for you since when
 you downloaded it was yj-001.zip and when you unzipped it, it was yj-001.txt.
 so if you couldnt figure out it was the first issue, then i feel sorry for
 you.

 03 [ malibu shores - by big hurt ]

 the season premiere for malibu shores was on last night. it was a two hour
 movie premiere to thickin the plot for the rest of the season. it was
 really good and if you missed it, i feel sorry for you, because it was a
 must see.

 keri russel, who played clowie did a good job at her character and then the
 guy she meet at the beach zack did a very good job. it looks like they
 both have good careers for them. and this will be the ice breaker for both
 of there careers.

 the show was produced by aaron spelling. the guy that produced bevery hills,
 90120 and melrose place. which i might add where both good shows. but this
 show i believe is much better. it seems more real to life than 90120 was
 because of something the actors are doing. they play there character very
 well and dont have too much drama, but enough to make it real.

 the show is on saturday nights in arizona on channel 12 from 7 to 8 pm.
 check your local listings to find out what time malibu shores is on.

 05 [ parental control - by clark ]
        
        Okay, seeing that I just have been relieved of a week long period of
being grounded I felt I had a good background in this area.  What area you 
ask?  Well todays issue is parental control and the effects it has on a young
"adult".  Laugh at me you may but this is rather a serious topic that all  
teens face at one point in their life.  After sitting through a rather, how 
should I say, a extremely degrading conversation with my father where he 
repeadely said I was a stupid and had no idea of what my responsibilties are,
I sat there and tried to figure out where this anger was comeing from.  Did 
my father just like to yell at me and that he found it quite amusing?  Well 
that is very much true and I believe in this whole heartedly.  However I sat
there and realized that.. hold on.. Yes indeed.. <gasp> my parents did care
about me.  Shunned beyond belief, it took me several minutes to actually 
catch my breath.  This is supposed to be a period of my life where the 
child is supposed to rebel against his parents, disregard all that they spoke 
of.  What was wrong with me?  I actually was listening to what my father was 
trying to get across to me.  No not the part about me being an idiot <my 
grades can prove that one>, but that I had not held my responsibiltys 
through.  I put my parents through over an hour of grief as I came home 
almost an hour and a half past my curfew.  The whole time I never once 
thought my parents would care.  After realizing where they were comeing from 
<quite surprised I must admit>, I've decided to, yes, actually listen to them 
and obey the guidlines that they set for me.  After all, I turn 18 in two 
more years and I can move out of the house and live on my own, so I might as 
well give my parents some time where they can actually feel like they control 
me.   So the moral of the story is.." Whenever a monkey sticks his cock in a 
guys beer, its funny as hell and its okay to laugh."  -- THE END.
                                                    article by -- clark

 07 [ no doubt - by big hurt ]

 well today i had a phat wallet with me. i was always with my friend when he 
 was shopping with his sister, staci, and his mother. we were also at millers
 outpost and they had alot of stuff on sale. good for them, right? well. i 
 wasnt going to buy anything at all. i didnt even plan on going there to buy
 anything. not spend a fucking dime. i was really along to get out of my
 house, look at his sister, and give him some advise on the stuff to buy.

 wrong. well i did look at his sister and did kind of help him pick some of
 the stuff he did buy. anyways, i was looking at the no fear shirts. i never
 ever had a no fear shirt. after prolly 20 minutes of looking around and 
 putting grubby paws all over the various no fear shirts they had, i finally
 got a white one, that a sports cup (fer fucking nuts). below that it said:
 "committed to keeping men &  their balls together as one". and below that is
 said no fear (like not shit) and then it said "parts dept". 

 since i play baseball i thought it would a nice jester to get something that
 deals with baseball. the most important thing to men that play baseball is 
 the cup. why you ask? like duh. and if you dont know why, then go ask mommy 
 and daddy.

 well we got everything and then my friend wanted to go to the mall and look
 around. so we did and by that time i was determined to blow the rest of my
 money. what the hell, i'm getting a check from the government for $50 (like
 it will ever get here). i was going to buy a bass guitar from balls wilson, 
 a local bbser to me, but some how i accidentaly spent that money on a "no
 doubt" cd and the new "adam sandler" cd, called "what the hell happened to
 me?". i've listend to like 8 songs on the "adam sandler" cd and i'm currently
 listing to the last half of the "no doubt" cd, which is pretty good. i've 
 heard many things about the cd and questioned purchasing the album myself,
 but it is better than people have said it was. my favorite song is just a 
 girl and spiderwebs, along with other songs, that i dont the know the names 
 of because i dont have the cd in front of my face. it is in the other room
 next to my stereo player.

 so if you like hearing a chick sing and like alternative music and rock, 
 then i suggest getting no doubt's album "tradgic kingdom". it is quite good.
 also, i've seen gwen who does the vocals for the band preform on mtv and 
 seen parts of the video and she just seems really hyper and gets into the 
 music on stage. one of the kids on my baseball team say that they where
 good in concert when they opened for bush here in arizona.

                     An Theory on Evolution in Progress

        
        It seems that everywhere I look that people are getting it. Yeah,
thats right. Sex is everywhere. Sex, Sex, Sex. I can remember just a few 
decades ago when sex wasn't even discussed. So it is natural to ask why. 
        Why?
        While it is true that mass media in the forms of tv, radio, 
telephones and others came together in the past few years, I don't think 
that the messages these forms convey are enough to push America and the rest
of the World over the edge.
        It has to be something inside.
        Remember back to the fifties. Remember the nick-at-nightesque shows
which aired. These were some of the best looking people of their time. 
Go and open up that treasured family picture album of the family back in
Europe. Notice that they don't look that great. Auntie Ruth had an 
interesting facial structure, to say the least, eh? 
        Now remeber back to today at school. Some great looking people 
indeed. Remember that one girl? You know, the petite blue-eyed blonde who
makes you think of things that shouldn't exactly be disscussed at the dinner
table. My school has about a billion of these "beautiul girls,". Now I don't
know what the thought process is for women, but my guess is it is the same in 
the sense that they know who looks better than someone else. 
        Refer back to Auntie Ruth's picture. Blah! Not exactly the cheerleader 
in homeroom. 
        Now I believe in evolution, and "survival of the fittest," but not in
the same huge scale that it is on. I don't believe it took us 900 million
year to lose some hair and get that crink out of our back. 
        I mean, come on. Doesn't it look as if people got better looking as of
late? Did you want to do Auntie Ruth instead of that half the girls last hour?
        If a species doesn't breed, they die out. Pretty simple to me. So if
we do it more, isn't it likely that we have more kids? So, isn't it natural
for people to breed to look better? Why not? To silly? I doubt it. Some 
animals evolve extra appendages to help feeding. Or webbed feet to help 
swimming. And this on an animal which resides in the air. (A duck, stupid.)
        Everywhere you look, beautiful people. Left, right. 
Maybe even across. Hmm, didn't always seem like this. 
        If this isn't Darwinian theory, then what is happening to us? I 
personnally think we look great. At least as a whole. I also think that we
didn't always look this good. Bust out that history book you haven't looked
at all year. Check out the renaissance, the enlightment, the revoltuion. This
is when paintings finally became accurate. I personnally don't think that 
Catherine the Great was that great at all. How about Marie Antoinette? I 
would have to say about a 4. 
        Refer back to Auntie Ruth's mug. Well, better than Joan of Arc. 
        I think it has been centuries of evolution, but it has been up until 
the past few decades when mother nature took a good look at itself and
decided it would trace the face before painting it on. 
        Radical evoultion in the past few years, I'm telling you. 
        
        So, savor this time of our own greatness, and make sure to roll around
in it; that is what it is meant for.

 09 [ baseball - by big hurt ]

 well my team finally won our first season game. after we won two games in a
 tournament weeks ago. we arent that bad, we havent been coming together as a
 whole. we havent been playing like a team should be playing. so we finally
 won, after we started to gel a little bit more.

 we won 5 - 4 as i pitched 5 strong innings, striking out 5 batters and 
 walking 3 batters and giving up about 6 hits. i also kept my streak of 
 hitting a batter every single game. i'm not trying to hit the batter, it
 just seems that i've lost my control at times. 

 well we had hamburgers after the game, cause of all of the hit - a - thon 
 money that we brought in. glad we won on that day, so we could enjoy our
 burgars going down, while we tried to digest them.

 anyways, i've still got more to learn, mostly mental. but after buying and
 reading a book called "the pitching edge" by tom house, phd (one of the best
 pitching coaches in the major leagues), i've learned that i need to change
 certain things in my mechanics and my delivery, so that i dont totally fuck
 my arm up, so i dont have a chance at playing college ball and possibly pro
 ball. one of my coaches which played pro ball, says i have a good chance at
 making it to the pros, as long i change my mechanics and doing everything 
 right, espically what the book says, not so much of what my pitching coach
 says. he is pretty good and he trying to do something, but i've realized that
 he doesnt know all of that much of pitching, at least not the right stuff at
 the proper time.

 anyways, sorry to bore you with this article, but i just had to sit down and
 write it. i know someone will read it and like it or hate it.

 10 [ just a girl - by no doubt ]

 i thought i would share my song lyrics for just a girl, no doubt's most
 famous song.

 take this pink ribbon off my eyes
 i'm exposed
 and it's no big surprise
 don't you think i know
 exactly where i stand
 this world is forcing me
 to hold your hand

 'cause i'm just a girl, little ol' me
 don't let me out of your sight
 i'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
 so don't let me have any rights
 oh...i've had it up to here!

 the moment that i step outside
 so many reasons
 for me to run and hide
 i can't do the little things
 i hold so dear
 'cause it's all those little things
 that i fear

 'cause i'm just a girl
 i'd rather not be
 'cause they won't let me drive
 late at night
 i'm just a girl
 guess i'm some kind of freak
 'cause they all sit and stare
 with their eyes
 i'm just a girl
 take a good look at me
 just your typical prototype
 oh...i've had it up to here!
 oh...am i making myself clear?

 i'm just a girl
 i'm just a girl in the world...
 that's all that they will let me be!

 i'm just a girl, living in captivity
 your rule of thumb
 makes me worry some
 i'm just a girl, what's the destiny?
 what i've succumbed to
 is making me numb
 i'm just a girl, my apologies
 what i've become is so burdensome
 i'm just a girl, lucky me
 twiddle-dum there's no comparison
 oh...i've had it up to!
 oh...i've had it up to!!
 oh...i've had it up to here.

 there you go the lyrics for just a girl written by gwen stefani, lead vocals,
 and tom dumoni, guitar.

 11 [ we got a place to be - by big hurt ]

 well guess what. when finally have place to stay. that place is called
 entropy. it is a new bbs and will be the first whq's for yellow journal.

 it is ran by point man and clark, which i'm pretty close with them. you can
 pick up the current issues and last issues of yellow journal. all you have
 to do is put this number into your communication software and let it dial:

 entropy! (602) 706 - 6201

 i haven't had any problems of it being down, until it finally went up 24/7.

 so give it a ring and say you are there to get some zines. and also say that
 i sent you.

 this isnt totally my joke. saw it on toastycome in the 602 area.

 anyways here it goes.

 okay. the answer was. 3rd grade.

 hahahaha. that was so funny. anyways, there you go.

 13 [ easter - by big hurt ]

 well today is april first. i called up a kid on my baseball team and he 
 started shitting me that we had a game earlier. so i started freaking out
 and he said he was just messing with me. then i just went to look at the
 calender and it happened to be april first, april fools day.

 this day is even worse than getting pinched when not wearing any green on
 saint patricks day. why the fuck do you need to wear green on that day for
 anyways? if i dont wanna wear green, i shouldnt get pinched.

 anyways, easter was prolly my second favorite holiday ever. besides that
 day that you get tons of presents and you get to open them. no i'm not 
 talking about your birthday. it's christmas fuck nut.

 anyhow, easter was fun for me when i was a kid. my mom would get lots of 
 eggs and she would help me decerate the eggs and all that. then like a week
 or two later, i would wake up on that sunday morning looking for those egss.

 of course when you were a little kid you would start like at 2 o'clock in
 the morning and keep going until you found the last one, cause you knew 
 how many egss there was, since you helped decerate them. then by the time
 your parents woke up, you've found them and you can begin eating breakfast.

 i would always have some candy in my basket along with some toy or little
 price type deal.

 those are the days that i miss. as i begin to realize that the things i eat
 are very important. i have to stay more healthy since i plan on going far
 in baseball. so i might not be getting that much candy. i kind of mentioned
 to my mom that i didnt want any, but i'm sure knowing my mom that she will
 getting me some candy.

 but it seems weird celebrating holidays since i'm almost an adult. i'm 17
 now and getting older by the second. maybe i can enjoy the holidays again
 after my life isnt always full of stress and chaos. maybe when i decide to 
 settle down and start up my own family and have children to spend time with
 during the holidays.

 i just hope this easter is somewhat special. 
 
 so everyone have a happy easter!

 14 [ the talking dog - by big hurt ]

 once upon a time, there was a talking dog, named ralph. anyways, he was not
 your normal dog. yes he could talk but still his master, chuck, was very 
 mean to him and left him tied up to the basketball hoop or a stick in the 
 yard. even though ralph was smart, he wasn't smart enough to figure some way
 to get free from the pole.

 well people would come by the house that he was out in front and throw things
 at him and just tease him. he didnt understand why people did this to him.
 but it still happened regardless.

 on a sunny day in april, three older boys, the ages of about 17 or 18, walked
 by a saw ralph the dog that they use to beat the shit out of and tease with
 t-bone steaks. which ralph never ended up getting.

 john  : "hey look its ralph", pointing to ralph.
 tony  : "whats up ralph?"
 ralph : "nothing much, just here being tied up to the pole by this rope."
 jim   : "so how is life treating you."
 ralph : "i'm getting sleep and all that. but when my owner comes home drunk,
         he likes taking it out on me."
 jim   : "really. and what do you do. do you just sit there and take it."
 ralph : "well yeah. it is like the days when you guys would tease me and 
          kick and punch me."
 tony  : "hey, those were the times, werent they?"
 john  : "hell yeah."
 ralph : "they were okay. but there is this fat kid. he is a major cock. he
          think he owns this neighborhood. one day he came by and sat on me.
          that fat fuck had some harry balls for the age he is."
 tony  : "really. i think i have hairy balls also. but i usually only let me
          girlfriend see those puppies."
 ralph : "really. umm, well can you guys let me free from this pole. my owner
          comes home, kicks me a few times and then goes inside. at least you
          think he could let me go from this pole here and go inside."
 jim   : "it is a sad thing. you should tell your owner to be nicer to you. 
          and let you in more often."
 ralph : "yeah, i could do that. but he prolly would just end up kicking me
          more. where are you guys going?"
 john  : "we are going to the church dance."
 ralph : "hrmm. do you think i could tag along with you cock suckers."
 john  : "well i dont think so. because i dont think they would let a dog into
          our church dance. sorry, maybe the next time we go somewhere else."
 ralph : "okay. i see how it is. yeah, yer prolly right. those tight asses at
          yer church wouldnt let a dog in."
 tony  : "sorry ralph."
 ralph : "yeah i know. but it would be really nice to go. since i'm a the 
          right height of looking up and seeing the girls underwear."
 jim   : "are you really. yeah you would be, wouldnt you?"
 ralph : "sure am. too bad i cant go. it is even better when i get the girls
          wearing no underwear under there dresses. there was this girl on
          time, that i saw she didnt have any underwear. i saw her bend down.
          by that time, my cock was nice and hard. so i went up to her and 
          tried to slip my dick and i happened to get a little bit in, before
          she started to push me away. so i just went up to her and started
          licking her nice fucking wet pussy. and boy was her pussy wet. i had
          her coming everywhere. it was so wet, it looked like a waterfall. 
          and it tasted so good."
 john  : "hahahaha. look jim. even the dog is pussy from a human and you cant
          even do that."
 ralph : "well i'll see you fuckers later."
 tony  : "okay. later."
 jim   : "later doggy."
 john  : "okay. maybe bite yer owner one of these days for me, okay?"
 ralph : "yeah, yeah. i'll do that. maybe i'll even bite his nuts and make
          them bleed. that would serve him right. well later all."

 15 [ pissed off - by big hurt ]

 well right now i'm really fucking pissed off. my coach decides to move me
 down to junior varsity to pitch one game. at least that what he says. so 
 i'm suppose to go practice with them and then pitch a game for them. my arm
 hurts anyways. why not rest me. he says it is to build confidence and all 
 that bullshit. but, i guess my coach just doesnt know how to communicate with
 me and get some of this information that he has been trying to feed me across
 to me. all he does is basically either yell or says it in a voice that would
 make you think he hates you. he gets on my case all of the time. he says that
 i'm not mentally tough. maybe that is because of him getting on my case and 
 wondering if i'm gonna get yelled this play or the next. well some people are
 shit heads and some arent, but this months shit head award goes to my coach.

 16 [ broken arrow - by big hurt ]

 i went today to see broken arrow with a friend, which ended up paying for my
 way in. which i'm very glad, since i didnt have any money to get into the 
 movies. 

  Broken Arrow

  (1995)
  
   Directed by John Woo
   Written by Graham Yost
   Starring: John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy
   Lindo, Bob Gunton, Frank Whaley, Howie Long, Vondie Curtis-Hall,
   Kurtwood Smith.
   Cinematographer: Peter Levy
   Editors: John Wright, Steve Mirkovich, Joe Hutsching
   Production Designer: Holger Gross
   Producers: Mark Gordon, Bill Badalato
   20th Century Fox / Rated R.
   
   
   Having at last regained his star status, John Travolta is determined
   to enjoy it. His infectiously enthusiastic turn as a villain in
   Broken Arrow raises an already exciting action picture into a pure
   adrenaline rush.
   
   Travolta plays Maj. Vic Deakins, an Air Force pilot on a training
   mission with his partner, Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater), to fly
   a B-3 Stealth bomber over the Utah desert carrying two nuclear
   warheads. Deakins, though, is on another mission -- he ejects Hale
   from the cockpit, dumps the unarmed nukes in the desert, abandons the
   bomber and lets it crash. The military labels the incident a "broken
   arrow,'' code for a lost nuclear weapon.
   
   And, even with the whole of the United States military looking for the
   nukes, it's up to Hale to chase Deakins and his mercenaries across the
   Utah desert (parts of the film were shot in Utah, but most was shot in
   Arizona and Montana). Hale gets some impromptu help from a plucky park
   ranger, played by Samantha Mathis (who partnered with Slater in Pump
   Up the Volume back in 1990).
   
   As exciting as Travolta, Slater and Mathis are, the real star of
   Broken Arrow is director John Woo. The Hong Kong emigre infuses the
   movie with the same hyperkinetic energy that he showed in his great
   Asian films, The Killer and Hard-Boiled. He adds many of his
   trademark touches -- two-fisted gunplay, eye-to-eye standoffs, some
   bloody death scenes and really BIG explosions.
   
   Woo is aided by a Hollywood-friendly script by Graham Yost (Speed),
   that propels the action on planes, trucks, helicopters and a train.
   Yost even throws a few Speed references (in the truck, Mathis is
   driving, a la Sandra Bullock) and, for Travolta, a slick Pulp Fiction
   reference (shouting "I say goddamn, what a rush!'' much as Uma Thurman
   did). For an audience-thrilling (if rather bloody) action picture that
   will blow you out of the seats, Broken Arrow is right on target.

 17 [ what not to ask - by clark ]

        Just recently I have been lucky enought to, guess what, obtain a                                                    
 woman for myself.  Not saying that I've never had a woman before, but rather                                                    
 that I got one recently.  Get it?  Well good, anywayz, after the first long
 phone conversation that we shared we established that we werent going to get
 serious in any way, but rather just go out, and say that we are "seeing" each
 other.  Well I thought,"okay this is cool, I can go out with her... and also 
 try and hook up with this other chick".  Well upon realizing that there wasnt
 much hope for any kind of fling with this other chick I decided to devote my 
 time and energy into the one "relationship" I currently had going.  Well its
 been two weeks now and so I decided to pop the question.  No I didnt ask her
 to marry me, or to bear my children, but what her feelings were towards me.
 The result I received was quite like a slap on the face, except over the 
 phone.  She was disapointed in me for not knowing.  How the hell am I going
 to know how she feels about me?  Anywayz she started crying and hanged up on
 me, leaving me feeling quite confused for I hadnt done anything.  So my 
 question is...  Why do woman expect us guys to know what they are thinking?
 Is there a common belief among the female sex that states that all men have
 a working knowledge of telepathy?  Tommorrow I will try to get things all
 straight with her when she comes over to my house.  The moral that I have for
 you is "if you fail on the first date of getting her pregnant, make a second
 date"

 19 [ prejudice and more prejudice - by clark ]

        Once again Im back with yet another fabulous piece of information to                                                    
 give to you, the reader.  Todays Topic is ... <drum roll>.. "Prejudice, why
 we hate eachother".  In today's society we find ourselves degrading other
 races and creeds for their opinions or their beliefs.  We turn are face to
 those who think differently, we laugh at those that dont agree with us.  Why
 is this?  Why must we hate eachother?  Well I have reached one conclusion 
 that I believe can be the answer to this question.  Plain put its Penis Envy.
 We hate our brothers because its a constant race on who can build up the
 "bigger" image of the size of their penis.  We try to think of creative ways
 to say.."hey.. mine is bigger than yours", and when we feel as though the 
 other person is winning the battle we try to find some excuse to label them
 as "socially un-wanted".  I believe that we must just sit down, get it out
 of our systems, and face the fact that.. yes some will be bigger, yet some 
 will be smaller.  So once we can face the truths then we will be able to
 tear down the barriers we have set against our friends and sing kum-bai-yah 
 around the campfire.

 20 [ me f0ur!@ - by big hurt ]

 i just read some no sense piece of shit that was quite well written for dto
 by the common man. i just read a piece of dog shit. and it was written by
 mogel. the little article was entitled 'me three'. 

 but amazing as it is, mogel did bring up many good points. man, i would let
 mogel be my pschylogist any day. if he can analyze his own situations, then
 why cant he do my own. well i do analyze my own situations, along with that
 i also study and analyze people. i see the things they do and say. i also
 really watch the naked girls, but i'll talk more about that some other time.

 see mogel talked about a bunch of pointless bull shit, which i think was the
 point he was trying to get across to use the readers of the zine scene. what
 is the zine scene? is it just a time for people to fuck around and write 
 things that come to there mind. thats what i think it is. actually many of
 the people that are writings for zines, could become supreme writers for a
 newspaper, magazine, or be an author of many many books.

 that even means me. yes, i could be that great and whatever i want to be. 
 you wanna stinking know why. because i have motivation and the desire to
 better myself. this is what many people lack in the world. instead they
 waste way not doing anything, except wasting away. 

 do you get my point. well you better, because me and many other people are
 going to pass you by, while you will be sitting there on the ground crying
 in the pile of dust that sits upon your little scrony head. but if you 
 realize that you can do anything, maybe, just maybe someday you will be 
 right at the back of the heels still getting your face stomped in, but not
 so bad.

 see there are many people like me and mogel. see mogel is a big talker and
 i think probably can back most of the things he does up.

 see it takes alot of talent and motivation to hold the shift key down and 
 make it turn out big caps. congradulations on that effort. but i believe 
 whoever made the keyboards, put the caps lock there for a purpose. you ever
 think that it would be alot easier on you and not take up so much time 
 typing the shit out. to tell you the truth, caps are for pussies. 

 yes, i said pussies. 

 you are just one big smelly pootnany. 

 yes, i said pootnany, which means pussy in spanish. 

 yes, i'm bilingual. i dont know much in spanish, but i know a few other
 words in other languages.

 so you better start recongizing me and learn to fear me. 
 
 and yes, i can spell fear the proper way. not the way people think is elite.
 do you find this fucking spelling 'phear' of fear in the god damn dictionary.

 if you dont believe me, go look it up.

 well i'm waiting. 

 <your hairy ass comes back from looking in the new-webster dictionary.>

 see i told you that you wouldnt find that spelling of fear in that off red
 piece of poop.

 see and i'm big hurt. bringing a bunch of pain to your eyes and brains. and
 i write for a text file zine called yellow journal. corny name you say. well
 i though of it and i dont give a crap, cause it is different, like me. and
 if you got a problem with all of my shit and dont like me, think i smell, or
 think i look ugly, then move over, cause this horny teenager with a 8 inch
 cock is here to stay. so watch the fuck out, or i'll dick slap you, with
 some cock'n'balls.

 21 [ silence - by big hurt ]

 the wind just stopped blowing out the bedroom window of a zine writer.

 frannie was in his bed clinging onto the bed sheets as his scrony body 
 shivered to create some heat. but it seemed that he was getting colder and
 colder.

 the night was silent and now nothing could be heard in his huge house or
 outside of his bedroom. he was getting scared, because even though he hated
 beginning cold and it blowing outside, he wished there was some noise to
 sooth his ears, so it would be easier to get to sleep.

 he flung the covers off from his body and onto the floor. he got up and 
 decide that he should take a piss. but he was having second thoughts if he
 should or not, since pissing in his bed would keep him warm for the rest of
 the night as he felt the wet, but warm urine soak into his matress.

 he decided not to and continued onto the bathroom, where he flip the light
 switch. 

 bewm!@

 "fuck," murmered frannie as the light bulb blew out. "i hate when this 
 shit happens. i swear that i'm gonna kill the fucker that makes these 
 lights and send them out to the stores and rips us good working people
 off."

 his parents where on vacation and he had the house to himself and decided
 that he could go use his parents bathroom. he dragged his lumpy body into
 the other bathroom.

 bewm!@

 "fuck," murmered frannie as he stubbed his big toe into the wall. "i hate
 when this shit happens. where is the light switch?"

 frannie moved his hand vigoursly on the wall looking for the light switch.
 he found it and gave it juice. 

 "lights," yelled frannie. "i've got lights."

 with the pain starting to wear off he stumbled over to the toilet. he pulled
 out his cock'n'balls and let it rip. the yellow stream of urine filled and
 mixed with water already in the toilet. the smell was refreshing to frannie
 and woke him up even more (which might not be a good thing, since it is 
 like already 3am and he has only gotten 2 hours of sleep).

 he returned to his room and got back into his bed. he let out a couple juicy
 farts (hey, now one is around). 

 as he started to relax and get comfortable, he heard some noises from the 
 kitchen. they sounded if someone was getting into his big smelly fucking 
 american cheese. but frannie was frozen in his bed. he couldnt move a single
 bit.

 the noise continued on and on. finally the noise was getting closer and 
 closer to his room. now frannie was scared even more. 

 frannie decided he had to do something. so he started to slowly get up out of
 his bed, be aware that something was in his house. maybe a burglar or even
 worse an illegal allien that came across the boarder.

 the noises and sounds kept going on and on, until he heard a loud thunk. he
 was startled and almost feel over on his bed. but he maintained hisself and
 kept on walking, taking each step with much awareness.

 he finally got to the hall way and could hear noises from the now closed
 bedroom door of his parents room. this was quite strange.

 "maybe someone is stealing shiznit from the parents room," though frannie.

 he turned on the hall light and saw a crumb of his big smelly fucking
 american cheese on the plate that he left the 20 pound log of cheese on in
 the first place. now frannie was pissed off. the steam was rising from his
 ears.

 he went to the bedroom door and it had a piece of note paper attached to it.

 it said in a very scribbly hand writing: "DON'T DISTRUBE US OR YOU SHALL BE
 IN SERIOUS TROUBLE!"

 he thought and got even more scared. he could hear things falling to the
 floor and squishing noises from the room. he was wondering what was going
 on in there.

 he decided it was time to find out and let the door open just a little. he
 tried getting a look, but he had to open even more. he finally saw on the
 bed in the dim light was his mom and dad fucking. about 2 pounds of the 
 cheese was on the bed next to them. 

 frannie was scared by the sight and decided this night wouldve been better
 silent. he laid in his bed, trying to get over the awful visions of his
 parents doing the wild thing.

 to be continued ...

 22 [ hacking - by big hurt ]

 ever since hackers have started popping up, they have been to be people that
 are harmful and can cause damage on computer systems. yes, they could 
 destroy a system and the hit of the enter key, if they are good enough. but
 this is not true for most hackers. and when hackers get caught, the charges
 seem to be way out of hand. when the media finds out about a hacker, they
 blow things even more out hand. they give hackers a bad rap. 

 here is a article that i cut out of the local paper (The Arizona Republic).

 -- --- -]
 
 1st U.S. online wiretap find snoopy hacker

 Knight-Ridder Newspapers

 WASHINGTON - He called himself Griton, Spanish for screamer, and reputedly
 used stolen Harvard University passwords to sneak into U.S. military
 computers from his home in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

 He hacked his way into NASA's jet-propulsion lab, poked around the Los Alamos
 National Laboratory, and tried, but failed to invade the Army Research lab's
 computer system.

 On Friday, federal officals announced an arrest warrant for Julio Cesar
 Ardita, 22, who was described as part cybersnoop, part cyberspook, unmasked
 in an international crime hunt carried out with the first-ever computer 
 wiretap order.

 "This is a case of cybersleuthing, a glimpse of what computer crime fighting
 will look like in the coming years," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern sad. "We
 have made enormous strides in developing the investigative tools to track
 down individuals who misuse vital computer networks."

 The felony charges are fraudulent possession of unauthorized computer
 passwords, destructive activity in connection with computers and illegal
 interception of electronic communications.

 Although Ardita hacked his way into "important and sensitive information
 in government research files on satellites, radiations and energy-related
 engineering," a Justice Department released said, Ardita is "not accused
 of obtaining classified information related to national security."

 And Ardita many never face trial. Although the United States has extradition
 treaty with Argentina, the crimes for which he is being sought are not
 extraditable, Justice Department spokesman John Russell.

 Attorney General Janet Reno said the unusual use of a wiretap, in which 
 law-enforcement officers electronically sifted through billions of bytes to
 hunt down and identify an unauthorized hacker, "is an example of how the
 Fourth Amendment and a court order can be used to protect rights while 
 adapting to modern technology."

 The tap was attached to the Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Science
 computers in the last two months of 1995, according to Justice Department 
 officals.

 It was issued by a federal judge in Boston and involved a balancing act
 between federal interests in tracking down the hacker and the need to ensure
 other people's privacy on the Internet, Stern said.

 woa!@ i thought that article was the biggest piece of shit. they blew things
 out of hand. made the gov't look like they did something big. it aint that
 hard to do a tap or monitor a computer system.

 but if they think this will stop hackers, then the gov't is 100 percent 
 wrong. this will only make them mad and more eager to try to get past the 
 newer techology.

 if you have any articles or information of hackers beginnning caught by law
 enforcers, please send them to me via email at lowen@goodnet.com.

 23 [ disney - by balls wilson ]



 You ever wonder why the hell you always want to beat off when you watch disney
 shows.. me netheir, but it's true disney has somehow got a pervert and or fag 
 in their animation and sound effects departments. Yes it bogles my mind too.. 
 what the hell is disney doing putting such messages subliminally in their 
 movies.

 i.e.

 Alladin --
 1.  On the balcony scene when you are watching Jasmine and Alladin (it scares
     me how i know there names) talking and shit like that.. turn the volume
     all the way up and listen real close if you did it correctly you should
     here Alladin say "Take off your clothes".. ehhw god thats horrifing!

 The Lion King --
 1.  Ok now for the Lion King.. what you do is you slow it down on the part 
     when Simba's dad ,Mufucka or something, falls of the cliff and there is
     a stampede or whatever.. now look real close at the dust of clouds.. 
     you should see the word "SEX".. i know, i know, lame as hell but it's 
     there..
 2.  Now there is another "SEX" in here.. it is in the part where the monkey 
     guy summons Simba's dad and then he says that shit to Simba and like 
     fads away.. alright go through that part frame by frame.. and in the 
     clouds you should see "SEX".. jeah.. this is becoming education for me!

 The little mermaid --
 1.  The cover of this priceless little fuckin video is cool.. you can see an
     erect penis in the background where all that crap is..

 welp, uhmm.. like that's all i know of but im sure there are more.. if you 
 find somemore like get in contact with me on any board running JiveNet and or
 my board "Vomitorium ù 3 to 7 ù 6o2/917/o516 (hhe..yeah a plug fer my board) 
 it's all art.. no warez.." --bw!

 25 [ the hackers manifesto - by the mentor ]

 well, since i've been into finding more information about hacking and hackers
 and what not, i've come across this. which was also used in the movie,
 "hackers".

 it is the part where they are about to catch the kids in that mall or 
 whatever and they are in the car and one officer is reading a piece of 
 paper, that parts come from this. pretty cool, eh?



=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                         \/\The Hacker's Manifesto/\/

                          Written on January 8, 1986
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...

        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?

        I am a hacker, enter my world...

Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...

        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."

        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...

        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them,
may never hear from them again... I know you all...

        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
 but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

 my favorite writer is stephen king. he such an amazing writer. he puts out
 pieces of art. he has dozens of books and has hundreds of writings. though
 he is getting older and older every day, he is still making money and having
 fun doing it.

 recently, he released a new serial series. it is called "the green mile". 
 book one is released, which is entitled, "the two dead girls". and the other
 one was released march 25th, which i was just made aware of today, when i
 visisted the the green mile web page (http://www.greenmile.com). it is called
 "mouse on the mile". 

 i will probably end up buying it in the next day or two. but since i was just
 on the internet, seeing what else i could dig up about stephen king and his
 writings. even his personal life. i found out that there was a hypertext book
 written by the man himself.

 so i will be bringing each chapter to you each month starting this month. it
 is kind of like the new series. but this one i'm pretty sure that you wont
 find on the bookshelves of a library or a bookstore. but, if you do happen to
 find the book or a printed and published version of this somewhere, please
 let me know.

 the title of this book written by stephen king is, "

 28 [ umney's last case - by stephen king ]
                               
                               UMNEY'S LAST CASE
                                       
   by Stephen King
   
     The rains are over. The hills are still green and in the valley
     across the Hollywood hills you can see snow on the high mountains.
     The fur stores are advertising their annual sales. The call houses
     that specialize in sixteen-year-old virgins are doing a land-office
     business. And in Beverly Hills the jacaranda trees are beginning to
     bloom.
     
   
   
   Raymond Chandler, The Little Sister
   
   I. The News from Peoria.
   
   It was one of those spring mornings so L.A.-perfect you keep expecting
   to see that little trademark symbol--(R)--stamped on it somewhere. The
   exhaust of the vehicles passing on Sunset smelled faintly of oleander,
   the oleander was lightly perfumed with exhaust, and the sky overhead
   was as clear as a hardshell Baptist's conscience. Peoria Smith, the
   blind paperboy, was standing in his accustomed place on the corner of
   Sunset and Laurel, and if that didn't mean God was in His heaven and
   all was jake with the world, I didn't know what did.
   
   Yet since I'd swung my feet out of bed that morning at the
   unaccustomed hour of 7:30 a.m., things had felt a little off-kilter,
   somehow; a tad woozy around the edges. It was only as I was shaving
   --or at least showing those pesky bristles the razor in an effort to
   scare them into submission--that I realized part of the reason why.
   Although I'd been up reading until at least two, I hadn't heard the
   Demmicks roll in, squiffed to the earlobes and trading those snappy
   one-liners that apparently form the basis of their marriage.
   
   Nor had I heard Buster, and that was maybe even odder. Buster, the
   Demmicks' Welsh Corgi, has a high-pitched bark that goes through your
   head like slivers of glass, and he uses it as much as he can. Also,
   he's the jealous type. He lets loose with one of his shrill barking
   squalls every time George and Gloria clinch, and when they aren't
   zinging each other like a couple of vaudeville comedians, George and
   Gloria usually are clinching. I've gone to sleep on more than one
   occasion listening to them giggle while that mutt prances around their
   feet going yarkyarkyark and wondering how difficult it would be to
   strangle a muscular, medium-sized dog with a length of piano-wire.
   Last night, however, the Demmicks' apartment had been as quiet as the
   grave. It was passing strange, but a long way from earth-shattering;
   the Demmicks weren't exactly your perfect life-on-a-timetable couple
   at the best of times.
   
   Peoria Smith was all right, though--chipper as a chipmunk, just as
   always, and he'd recognized me by my walk even though it was at least
   an hour before my usual time. He was wearing a baggy CalTech
   sweatshirt that came down to his thighs and a pair of corduroy
   knickers that showed off his scabby knees. His hated white cane leaned
   casually against the side of the card-table he did business on.
   
   ``Say, Mr. Umney! Howza kid?''
   
   Peoria's dark glasses glinted in the morning sunlight, and as he
   turned toward the sound of my step with my copy of the L.A. Times held
   up in front of him, I had a momentary unsettling thought: it was as if
   someone had drilled two big black holes into his face. I shivered the
   thought off my back, thinking that maybe the time had come to cut out
   the before-bedtime shot of rye. Either that or double the dose.
   
   Hitler was on the front of the Times, as he so often was these days.
   This time it was something about Austria. I thought, and not for the
   first time, how at home that pale face and limp forelock would have
   looked on a post-office bulletin board.
   
   ``The kid is just about okay, Peoria,'' I said. ``In fact, the kid is
   as fine as fresh paint on an outhouse wall.''
   
   I dropped a dime into the Corona box resting atop Peoria's stack of
   newspapers. The Times is a three-center, and over-priced at that, but
   I've been dropping that same chip into Peoria's change-box since time
   out of mind. He's a good kid, and making good grades in school--I took
   it on myself to check that last year, after he'd helped me out on the
   Weld case. If Peoria hadn't shown up on Harris Brunner's houseboat
   when he did, I'd still be trying to swim with my feet cemented into a
   kerosene drum, somewhere off Malibu. To say I owe him a lot is an
   understatement.
   
   In the course of that particular investigation (Peoria Smith, not
   Harris Brunner and Mavis Weld), I even found out the kid's real name,
   although wild horses wouldn't have dragged it out of me. Peoria's
   father took a permanent coffee-break out a ninth-floor office window
   on Black Friday, his mother's the only white frail working in that
   goofy Chinese laundry down on La Punta, and the kid's blind. With all
   that, does the world need to know they hung Francis on him when he was
   too young to fight back? The defense rests.
   
   If anything really juicy happened the night before, you almost always
   find it on the front page of the Times, left side, just below the
   fold. I turned the newspaper over and saw that a bandleader of the
   Cuban persuasion had suffered a heart attack while dancing with his
   female vocalist at The Carousel in Burbank. He died an hour later at
   L.A. General. I had some sympathy for the maestro's widow, but none
   for the man himself. My opinion is that people who go dancing in
   Burbank deserve what they get.
   
   I opened to the sports section to see how Brooklyn had done in their
   doubleheader with the Cards the day before. ``How about you, Peoria?
   Everyone holding their own in your castle? Moats and battlements all
   in good repair?''
   
   ``I'll say, Mr. Umney! Oh, boy!''
   
   Something in his voice caught my attention, and I lowered the paper to
   take a closer look at him. When I did, I saw what a gilt-edged shamus
   like me should have seen right away: the kid was all but busting with
   happiness.
   
   ``You look like somebody just gave you six tickets to the first game
   of the World Series,'' I said. ``What's the buzz, Peoria?''
   
   ``My mom hit the lottery down in Tijuana!'' he said. ``Forty thousand
   bucks! We're rich, brother! Rich!''
   
   I gave him a grin he couldn't see and ruffled his hair. It popped his
   cowlick up, but what the hell. ``Whoa, hold the phone. How old are
   you, Peoria?''
   
   ``Twelve in May. You know that, Mr. Umney, you gave me a polo-shirt.
   But I don't see what that has to do with--''
   
   ``Twelve's old enough to know that sometimes people get what they want
   to happen mixed up with what actually does happen. That's all I
   meant.''
   
   ``If you're talkin about daydreams, you're right--I do know all about
   em,'' Peoria said, running his hands over the back of his head in an
   effort to make his cowlick lie down again, ``but this ain't no
   daydream, Mr. Umney. It's real! My Uncle Fred went down and picked up
   the cash yest'y afternoon. He brought it back in the saddlebag of his
   Vinnie! I smelled it! Hell, I rolled in it! It was spread all over my
   mom's bed! Richest feeling I ever had, let me tell you--
   forty-froggin-thousand smackers!''
   
   ``Twelve may be old enough to know the difference between daydreams
   and what's real, but it's not old enough for that kind of talk,'' I
   said. It sounded good--I'm sure the Legion of Decency would have
   approved two thousand per cent--but my mouth was running on automatic
   pilot, and I barely heard what was coming out of it. I was too busy
   trying to get my brain wrapped around what he'd just told me. Of one
   thing I was absolutely positive: he'd made a mistake. He must have
   made a mistake, because if it was true, then Peoria wouldn't be
   standing here anymore when I came by on my way to my office in the
   Fulwider Building. And that just couldn't be.
   
   I found my mind returning to the Demmicks, who for the first time in
   recorded history hadn't played any of their big-band records at full
   volume before retiring, and to Buster, who for the first time in
   recorded history hadn't greeted the sound of George's latchkey turning
   in the lock with a fusillade of barks. The thought that something was
   off-kilter returned, and it was stronger this time.
   
   Meanwhile, Peoria was looking at me with an expression I'd never
   expected to see on his honest, open face: sulky irritation mixed with
   exasperated humor. It was the way a kid looks at a windbag uncle who's
   told all his stories, even the boring ones, three or four times.
   
   ``Ain't you picking up on this newsflash, Mr. Umney? We're rich! My
   mom ain't going to have to press shirts for that damned old Lee Ho
   anymore, and I ain't going to have to sell papers on the corner
   anymore, shiverin when it rains in the winter and havin to suck up to
   those nutty old bags who work down at Bilder's. I can quit actin like
   I died and went to heaven every time some blowhard leaves me a nickel
   tip.''
   
   I started a little at that, but what the hell--I wasn't a nickel man.
   I left Peoria seven cents, day in and day out. Unless I was too broke
   to afford it, of course, but in my business an occasional stony
   stretch comes with the territory.
   
   ``Maybe we ought to go up to Blondie's and have a cup of java,'' I
   said. ``Talk this thing over.''
   
   ``Can't. It's closed.''
   
   ``Blondie's? The hell you say!''
   
   But Peoria couldn't be bothered with such mundane stuff as the coffee
   shop up the street. ``You ain't heard the best, Mr. Umney! My Uncle
   Fred knows a doctor up in Frisco--a specialist--who thinks he can do
   something about my eyes.'' He turned his face up to mine. Below the
   cheaters and his too-thin nose, his lips were trembling. ``He says it
   might not be the optic nerves after all, and if it's not, there's an
   operation . . . I don't understand all the technical stuff, but I
   could see again, Mr. Umney!'' He reached out for me blindly . . .
   well, of course he did. How else could he reach out? ``I could see
   again!''
   
   He clutched at me, and I gripped his hands and squeezed them briefly
   before pushing them gently away. There was ink on his fingers, and I'd
   been feeling so good when I got up that I'd put on my new chalk
   worsted. Hot for summer, of course, but the whole city is air-
   conditioned these days, and besides, I was feeling naturally cool. I
   didn't feel so cool now. Peoria was looking up at me, his thin and
   somehow perfect newsboy's face troubled. A little breeze--scented with
   oleander and exhaust--ruffled his cowlick, and I realized that I could
   see it because he wasn't wearing his tweed cap. He looked somehow
   naked without it, and why not? Every newsboy should wear a tweed cap,
   just like every shoeshine boy should wear a beanie cocked way back on
   his head.
   
   ``What's the matter, Mr. Umney? I thought you'd be happy. Jeepers, I
   didn't have to come out here to this lousy corner today, you know, but
   I did--I even got here early, because I kinda had an idea you'd get
   here early. I thought you'd be happy, my mom hittin the lottery and me
   gettin a chance at an operation, but you ain't.'' Now his voice
   trembled with resentment. ``You ain't!''
   
   ``Yes I am,'' I said, and I wanted to be happy--part of me did,
   anyway--but the bitch of it was that he was mostly right. Because it
   meant things would change, you see, and things weren't supposed to
   change. Peoria Smith was supposed to be right here, year in and year
   out, with that perfect cap of his tilted back on hot days and pulled
   down low on rainy ones, so that the raindrops dripped off the bill. He
   was always supposed to be smiling, was never supposed to say ``hell''
   or ``frogging,'' and most of all, he was supposed to be blind.
   
   ``You ain't!'' he said, and then, shockingly, he pushed his card-
   table over. It fell into the street, papers flapping everywhere. His
   white cane rolled into the gutter. Peoria heard it go and bent down to
   get it. I could see tears coming out from beneath his dark glasses and
   go rolling down his pale, thin cheeks. He started groping for the
   cane, but it had fallen near me and he was going the wrong way. I felt
   a sudden strong urge to haul off and kick him in his blind newsboy's
   ass.
   
   Instead, I bent over, got his stick, and tapped him lightly on the hip
   with it.
   
   Peoria turned, quick as a snake, and snatched it. Out of the corner of
   my eye I could see pictures of Hitler and the recently deceased Cuban
   bandleader flapping all over Sunset Boulevard--a bus bound for Van
   Ness snored through a little drift of them, leaving a bitter tang of
   diesel fumes behind. I hated the way those newspapers looked,
   fluttering here and there. They looked messy. Worse, they looked
   wrong. Utterly and completely wrong. I fought another urge, as strong
   as the first one, to grab Peoria and shake him. To tell him he was
   going to spend the morning picking up those newspapers, and I wasn't
   going to let him go home until he'd gotten every last one.
   
   It occurred to me that less than ten minutes ago, I'd been thinking
   that this was the perfect L.A. morning--so perfect it deserved a
   trademark symbol. And it had been, dammit. So where had things gone
   wrong? And how had it happened so fast?
   
   No answers came, only an irrational but powerful voice from inside,
   telling me that the kid's mother couldn't have won the lottery, that
   the kid couldn't stop selling newspapers, and that, most of all, the
   kid couldn't see. Peoria Smith was supposed to be blind for the rest
   of his life.
   
   Well, it's got to be something experimental, I thought. Even if the
   doctor up in Frisco isn't a quack, and he probably is, the operation's
   bound to fail.
   
   And, bizarre as it sounds, the thought calmed me down.
   
   ``Listen,'' I said, ``we got off on the wrong foot this morning,
   that's all. Let me make it up to you. We'll go down to Blondie's and
   I'll buy you breakfast. What do you say, Peoria? You can dig into a
   plate of bacon and eggs and tell me all ab--''
   
   ``Fuck you!'' he shouted, shocking me all the way down to my shoes.
   ``Fuck you and the horse you rode in on, you cheap gumshoe! You think
   blind people can't tell when people like you are lying through their
   teeth? Fuck you! And keep your hands off me from now on! I think
   you're a faggot!''
   
   That did it--no one calls me a faggot and gets away with it, not even
   a blind newsboy. I forgot all about how Peoria had saved my life
   during that Mavis Weld business; I reached for his cane, meaning to
   take it away from him and whack him across the keister with it a few
   times. Teach him some manners.
   
   Before I could get it, though, he hauled off and slammed the cane's
   tip into my lower belly--and I do mean lower. I doubled up in agony,
   but even while I was trying to keep from howling with pain, I was
   counting my blessings; two inches lower still and I could have quit
   peeping for a living and gotten a job singing soprano in the Palace of
   the Doges.
   
   I made a quick, reflexive grab for him anyway, and he brought the cane
   down on the back of my neck. Hard. It didn't break, but I heard it
   crack. I figured I could finish the job when I caught him and ran it
   into his right ear. I'd show him who was a faggot.
   
   He backed away from me as if he'd caught my brainwave, and threw the
   cane into the street.
   
   ``Peoria,'' I managed. Maybe it still wasn't too late to catch sanity
   by the shirttail. ``Peoria, what the hell's wrong with--''
   
   ``And don't call me that!'' he screamed. ``My name's Francis! Frank!
   You're the one who started calling me Peoria! You started it and now
   everyone calls me that and I hate it!''
   
   My watering eyes doubled him as he turned and fled across the street,
   heedless of traffic (of which there was currently none, luckily for
   him), hands held out in front of him. I thought he would trip over the
   far curb--was looking forward to it, in fact--but I guess blind people
   must keep a pretty good set of topographical survey maps in their
   heads. He jumped onto the sidewalk as nimbly as a goat, then turned
   his dark glasses back in my direction. There was an expression of
   crazed triumph on his tear-streaked face, and the dark lenses looked
   more like holes than ever. Big ones, as if someone had hit him with
   two large-caliber shotgun rounds.
   
   ``Blondie's is gone, I toldja!'' he screamed. ``My mom says he upped
   and ran away with that redhead floozy he hired last month! You should
   be so lucky, you ugly prick!''
   
   He turned and went running up Sunset in that strange way of his, with
   his splayed fingers held out in front of him. People stood in little
   clusters on both sides of the street, looking at him, looking at the
   papers fluttering in the street, looking at me.
   
   Mostly looking at me, it seemed.
   
   This time Peoria--well, okay, Francis--made it as far as Derringer's
   Bar before turning to deliver one final salvo.
   
   ``Fuck you, Mr. Umney!'' he screamed, and ran on.

 29 [ grades - by big hurt ]

 grades? well they are a system that judges how good of a job you are doing in
 school doing your work. you could be sick from school for 9 to 13 days and
 still get an 'a'. you could maybe miss one day at the most and have a 'c' or
 even as low as a 'f' in a class. 

 well, for me i've been there every day for every class the past semister, 
 except for one class which i just recently missed. english. i had to go home
 and get my baseball uniform, which i needed for the game that day. or else
 my coach might have gotten extremely anger and red faced while yelling his
 mouth off at me.

 but today (friday), i got my report card. since i'm in my baseball coaches
 second hour class. the hour that we usually get our report cards, he handed 
 it to me, without really looking me in the eye. 

 i looked down and i got an 'a', an 'a', and the rest where happened to be
 'c' grades. i excepted worse in computer programming. since i havent done
 much work, just talk since we have a sub, for our teacher that just had a
 baby, a few days after my birthday. anyways, the sub never says anything to
 us. and i ended up getting a 'c', which isn't bad for the amount of work 
 that i did. but to tell you the truth he should have at least mentioned that
 we need to do our work or get on our cases when we werent doing any work.
 but instead, being smart as he is, he sits in the back briefly looking 
 around, while beating his dick back and forth in his slacks. then at the
 end of the hour, he looks up and decides to give us a grade from 0 to 3, 
 depending on how much work he saw us doing.

 but other than that, i worked hard to keep 3 classes grades up so that i 
 didnt get yellow or red carded (no pass, no play rule for sports). and i
 also kept the grades up and never let them slip. i also brought up my
 history grade from a 'c' to an 'a'. i also learned things from history. 
 right now we are doing a section on adoff hilter and dictators that ruled
 after world war 1.

 so remember that your grades are very important. it could mean getting into
 a highly rated college or just that old community college down the road. so
 always try your best in school and try to become active in class, instead of
 being brain dead, since our generation will pave the road for many years to
 come.

 30 [ toodle-lu - by big hurt ]

 okay. well this issue actually turned out better than i thought. i got more
 writers to write for the magazine. i believe that i improved in my writing
 skills during most of the days that i worked on this magazine. i got a 
 someone to do an actual ascii. we got a whq and also we have an offical net
 for the magazine, jive net.

 had a special reading which will keep being put in the magazine. which was
 the stephen king electronic book, which will be in the magazine for another
 six installments, which i hope you keep coming back to find out what happens
 each and every chapter.

 but i'm actually sad and dont have many words left. i'm sad that this issue
 is actually coming to a rapid end, since i didn't really spend that much
 time on it. maybe 2 and 1/2 weeks at the max. but i hope to get cracking 
 with more writings. but also i was disappointed that i didnt have any stories
 really, except for one that i did, that at least was a try at something. all
 i know is that i hope you didnt stop reading because you didnt like something
 or thought i piece of writing was lame or stupid. if you did, then you may
 not be reading this right now. but if you are reading this and read most of
 the magazine, i'm glad for you. because you may have learned something.

 also in next issue look for information on the unabomber suspect being held
 for possession of a bomb. he went on trial just last thursday for having that
 bomb at his wood cabin far away from the city life. also get ready for 
 another stephen king installment.

 in closing i will leave you with this writing from the first paragraph of 
 unabombers manifesto that was published by the washington post and also 
 spread on the internet.

 "industrial society and its future

 introduction

 1. the industrial revolution and its consequences have a been a diaster for
 the human race. they have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of
 us who live in 'advanced' countries, but they have destabilized society,
 have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities,
 have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the third world to
 physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural
 world. the continued development of technology will worsen the situation.
 it will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict
 greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater
 social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased
 physical suffering even in 'advanced' countries."
