 Well I have decided to publish my second O.F.F.H.P. This time I 
am going to focus on ATM
hacking. I have tried to find info on this subject because I am 
broke and I am not old enough 
to work. So here is all I have been able to uncover about ATM 
hacking.

 Recently I visited the computer museme in Boston. While I was 
there I wrote a little story in 
there database about what happened to me when I was on worlds 
chat (if your ever there check it 
if you search by name look under CyBeR sPyDeR.) Well to get on 
with what I was saying I went
there and in the internet worked planet exhibet there was 
something that read cards, like
charge cards, ATM cards, and stuph like that. I was always 
wondering what was on them but I 
did'nt know how to make a reader and they are to expensive to buy 
so I had not presueded it.
Well anyway I got my mom's ATM and swiped it through I was 
dumbfounded there did'nt seem to be 
any sort of encryption used or anything (very stupid.) The output 
would look something like this 
a person named John Smith who's pin was; 987253:

                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^john^^smith^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     dfggirr859454 fgj[e9ruwedojhiou#%$&%^
                     ^^chem bank^^fjhgldtururuf84$#$%^#$^$
                     ^^dldfgjgdf987253xdfljkdfdldgkdljdru^^

There was praticaly nothing there and all the lines that had 
valuable data were indicated with "^" 
(atleast 2 of them.) If you could learn how to get one of thoes 
readers to write just with that info 
you would be golden, but I think that is a lttle impraticale. So 
I have other ways to get in.

 ATM's work on a dedicated line to a type of server that 
constantaly will send info to the ATM.
It will tell it to accept the card or to spit it out, to give you 
money or to say your bank account
is empty well there is a line that is used for maintence and 
things like that. From what I read none 
of the data is encrypted. The access line will intercept all the 
data from both ends and you can
send data back and forth to either the ATM or the server and each 
will respond accordingly.This has been done before. By incerting a outdated card into the ATM
and then typeing in the pin for the old card. When that in done the ATM will say to the server is he OK?
normally the server would reply NO and tell the ATM to eat the card, but if you are connected to the service
line you can intercept the ATM's response and tell the ATM to give the person all the money in the ATM.
pretty cool huh. Although I haven't tried it and I am not sure on all the syntax used for the commands I bet
it isn't too hard to figure out all you would have to do is watch the commands go by and then change them
accordingly. That is all I have on ATM hacking but I thought I might ad a little something to this issue.

This is a new section I will try to add every month called BOMBS. I will profile one type of 
bomb each month.

                                    -------------------------

                                       "Light Bulb Bomb"
                                -----------------------------------

   Matirails
------------------

1)A torch that will melt glass.
2)Gasoline

5)Some sort of appoxy
6)A phuck'n ass hole who should die
7)A means of escape

Here is how it is done
----------------------

1)Get a light bulb
2)Melt a hole in the TOP of it with the torch
3)Fill the bulb slightly past the fillamint with gasoline
4)Fill the rest of the bulb with soap suds
5)Use the appoxy to seal the hole in the bulb
6)Replace the victims bulb with your special bulb [make sure the power is off.]
7)find a good spot to watch at least 1000 yds from the house/apartment.
8)DO NOT try this out on your self unless you have a death wish.
