   Synopsis
   --------
   
   The purpose of this list is to 'digest' current events of interest that
   affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

      cruciphux@dok.org.......... currently active

     I do NOT work for the government in any shape or form other than
    paying uh some of my erhm taxes...well most of it but fuck you 
    you don't need to know that. <sic>
    
    Ok i'm still a noone and a nobody, but yeah I *was* a hacker, been
    a cracker, ran a warez board (and a PD board) done some phone phun
    etc .. but all in my teens and i've since started wearing a "white
    hat" (but it has little grey specks on it I must admit) and I am in
    no way a "master hacker/phreaker" not "leet". I'm just me, take it or
    leave it, didn't want it, didn't need it, been there, done that ...
    you guys have the reigns now and i'm deadly curious as to what you're
    doing with them. Hell mail me for advice and shit if you want, i'll
    help if I can. I'll respond to all verifiable emails. Maybe even some
    aol.com's. <heh> I hear there's a new movie out "You've got burned!"
    or something? sounds cool gotta check that out...    

    If you're really curious and have "mad sk1llz" you prolly know who I
    am or could find out if you care so much, bfd. I've nothing to hide
    go ahead, it might be fun. ;-) just don't come to my house to rag on
    my ass coz badness may reign down upon you,and I have some heavyweight
    friends <grin who doesnt you ask?> well we all die sometime if you 
    wanna go early, fine by me. <sic>

    Version 1.0
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    I am noone, a nobody, I am not a phed or a narq, I could be you. I do
    this for myself and some friends, you get something out of it too?
    'whump, there it is'. Thats all there is to it, nothing more, Neither
    am I a "hax0r" or a "cracker" and hell if I were, you think i'd
    broadcast it all over some crummy news sheet? heh, get over it, this
    is meant to be a fun read, nothing more, so get reading. and if you ain't
    smiling, you're taking things much too seriously. Keep hacking and stay
    free ... w00t.

0.4  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.
     
     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article later in this issue) this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you up
     and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost like
     buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

                          extra arsehole!" - Myself

     for a 7 meg (seven megabytes) HD for my C64 bbs and thought I kicked
     ass. Oh yah I've run various bbs'es and even wrote one for the C= 
     machines INCLUDING the Vic-20 , someone said it couldn't be done so
     i just HAD to prove the fuqr wrong. <g> NEC-V20 chips anyone?

    A: We checked this issue out and indeed Ed is everywhere, people are
       currently looking for this person coz noone can possibly be every
       where at the same time, unless .. they are, could it be? gh0d???   
   
    Q: WTF is @HWA a copyright notice?
        
    A: No. @HWA and  @HWA'98 does not denote (c) 1998 its just a cool 'end of

    Q: What does AAM, EoF, EoD,NFC, NFR, PHAC, P/H/A/C/CC/CT/G/V/W, Plik!
       and etc mean??
    A: Check out your favourite search engine and do a search for those terms
       like "phac meaning" etc (If you're from AOL remove the quotation marks 
       when you type that in, those are the two little dot things that seem to
       hang in the air above letters, they look like skydiving sperm) 
   
    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.
      
    !=   - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
           ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
           an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
           to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint 
           fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)      
    AAM  - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)
   *AOL  - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
           clueless isp with seckurity that you can drive buses through, we're
           not talking Kung-Fu being no good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe?
    EoC  - End of Commentary
    EoA  - End of Article 
    EoF  - End of file
    EoD  - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)
    CC   - Credit Card phraud
    CCC  - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)
    NFC  - Depends on context: No Further Comment or No Fucking Comment

    America Online - Your Security 

    America Online's service, designed originally to handle about 30,000 users, is now
    serving millions. As a result, many of its flaws are coming out into the open -- one
    of the most prominent has been AOL's almost nonexistant security. In this mirror
    of the original AOL Security site, find out how it is that the AOL hacker
    community knows more about the service than AOL itself. 

    AOL: A Spammer's Paradise 

    Virtually every AOL member wages a day-to-day battle with unsolicited
    commercial junk mail. Is AOL doing all it can to stop its flow? Not a chance.
    AOL equips its users with nearly useless mail filtering options which do nothing but
    make spammers get a new domain name every day. In the process, AOL has
    made it easier and easier for spammers to build junk mail lists, and has done
    nothing to stop that "harvesting" beyond making it a TOS violation.

         Hacker gets hacked
         update by demoniz at Dec 28 , 12:25 CET

         LoRD OaK, the 'hacker' who defaced CyberArmy recently tries to keep
         the dispute between him and the webmaster of CyberArmy alive. He
         wrote 100 % Pure Bikkel: "I donno if it matters or not, but if you go
         to cyberarmy's webpage, it says the source was being "handed out" by
         someone. That someone is me and the webpage it was located at is
         www.confine.com under CGI-Warez. Also their script was already
         copyrighted and it is the EXACTLY the same script like word for word."
         No script at Confine.com, but a hacked site. One who hacks, gets
         hacked.

     12.02.98    Japan criticized for slack policing of Internet CP
     
     December 02, 1998

     TOKYO -- Hundreds of pornographic images of children flood
     Internet sites with addresses ending in "jp." It's a tip-off that they
     originate in Japan -- and that there is basically nothing officials can
     do about it. With no laws explicitly banning child pornography, Japan
     has acquired the dubious distinction of being the global leader in the
     fast-growing Internet child pornography business. Japanese police
     say there are about 1,200 commercial child pornography Internet
     sites in Japan. Some feature photos of children from Japan, others
     of Southeast Asian children. Keiji Goto, a senior official at the
     National Police Agency, said police are frustrated by cases in which
     they identified the source of a pornographic site but were unable to
     take further action.

     CHINESE CRACKERS GET DEATH SENTENCE

     Editor Comments:

     Just picked this up by Wired News ... not a nice story for this "xmas 
     special" Is this what the world is coming to? some countries don't fuck 
     around with ANY sort of anti-government sentiment, this is a classic example
     especially to 'the newbie contingent' to be damn sure you KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 
     GETTING YOURSELF INTO and be sure to cover your ass/tracks or you may get 
     something pushed up there, or even worse, be terminated

     The Story:
     Chinese Crackers Get Death (Reuters 8:55 a.m.  28.Dec.98.PST)
     
     SHANGHAI, China -- Two crackers who broke into a bank computer network 
     and stole 260,000 yuan (US$31,400) have been sentenced to death by a court
     in eastern China, the official Wenhui Daily said on Monday.  

     Hao Jinglong, formerly an accountant at the Zhenjiang branch of the 
     Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was condemned to death, as was his
     brother, Hao Jingwen, the newspaper said. The Yangzhou Intermediate Court 
     in Jiangsu province also confiscated 40,000 yuan from Hao. 

     The two opened 16 accounts under various names in a branch of the bank in
     September and later broke into the branch to install a controlling device
     in a bank computer terminal, the newspaper said. 

     They used the device to electronically wire 720,000 yuan in non-existent
     deposits into the bank accounts. Afterward, they successfully withdrew
     260,000 yuan from eight different branches of the bank, the newspaper
     said.

     Two sentenced for subverting state
     Author: <unknown>

     THE Chinese courts yesterday sentenced two men convicted of subverting 
     state power to 13 and 11 years in prison respectively. Xu Wenli, a 
     Beijing resident, and Wang Youcai, of East China's Zhejiang Province,
     also received a three-year deprivation of their political rights from
     the Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court and the Intermediate 
     People's Court of Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang. 

     Both Xu and Wang previously served prison terms in China. 

     In an open trial yesterday, the Beijing No 1 Intermediate People's Court
     found that in November this year, with the purpose of subverting state 
     power, Xu secretly planned the founding of the so-called "Beijing and 
     Tianjin Regional Party Committee of the China Democratic Party," 
     formulated this illicit organization's constitution, and served as its
     chairman. 

     The court also found that Xu made efforts to recruit party members, 
     planned to convene a national party congress, and sought and accepted 
     funds from some hostile overseas organizations in order to organize, plan
     and conduct subversive activities. 

     It was also proven by court investigation that from November 1997 to April
     1998, Xu used various means to stir up subversive activities. After hearing
     opinions from the prosecutors and the defence, the court ruled that in 
     accordance with relevant stipulations in China's Criminal Law, Xu's 
     activities constituted the crime of subverting state power, and he should 
     be punished according to law as both a principal element in the case and a
     recidivist. 

     In an open trial in Zhejiang, the Intermediate People's Court of Hangzhou 
     found that in June this year, with the purpose of subverting state power, 
     Wang secretly planned to found an illicit organization called the "China 
     Democratic Party," formed a "Zhejiang Preparatory Committee for the China
     Democratic Party," and formulated a party constitution and a declaration. 

     The court also found that in order to organize, plan and conduct subversive
     activities, Wang contacted some hostile overseas organizations, from which 
     he sought and accepted financial support. 

     After hearing the opinions of the prosecutors and the defence, the court 
     ruled that in accordance with relevant stipulations in China's Criminal Law
     Wang's activities constituted the crime of subverting state power, that the
     crime was severe, and that he should also be punished as a recidivist. 

     Xu and Wang families and people from various walks of life attended yesterday's
     court hearings. (Xinhua)

    " War declared on China and Iraq "


     contributed by Legion of the Underground 
     In a very heated and emotional discussion Legion of the
     Underground declared cyber-war on the information
     infrastructure of China and Iraq last night. They cited
     severe civil rights abuses by the governments of both
     countries as well as the recent sentencing to death of
     two bank robbers in China and the production of
     weapons of mass destruction by Iraq as the reasons for
     their outrage. 
 
     Quoting from the Declaration of Independence about the
     right of the people to govern themselves and stating
     that the US government will probably stand idly by while
     these atrocities happen in other countries the Legion of
     the Underground called for the complete destruction of
     all computer systems in China and Iraq. 
 
     "The Government controls what goes into our mouths
     lets not let them do the same with what comes out!"
     said one LoU member during a press conference held on
     IRC Monday night. 
 
     LoU mentioned that they may seek out assistance in
     their war from the Hong Kong Blondes. The HKBs are a
     well known group attempting to cause mayhem on
     China's internetworks from within the Iron Curtain. The
     HKBs where trained and assisted, until recently, by the
     infamous Cult of the Dead Cow hacking group. 

     Legion of Underground gained previous notoriety back in
     October for defacing the Chinese Human Rights web site
     a day after it went online.

     China sentences hackers to death for
     bank theft

     December 28, 1998 
     Web posted at: 3:09 AM EST (0809 GMT) 

     SHANGHAI, China (Reuters) -- Two hackers who broke into a bank
     computer network and stole 260,000 yuan (31,400) have been sentenced to
     death by a court in eastern China, the official Wenhui Daily said on Monday.
     
     ...
     
     They used the device to electronically wire 720,000 yuan in non-existent
     deposits into the bank accounts. Afterwards, they successfully withdrew
     260,000 yuan from eight different branches of the bank, the newspaper said.

2.2  Update on the death of Tron of the Chaos Computing Club (Germany)     
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      This is very old and tragic news but we have been waiting for the
     "official" results of the CCC's investigation to be released before
     getting into any real detail on this topic. Tron was one the best
     and most respected hackers in Europe.

     Berlin Prepares for Chaos
     by David Hudson 
    
 
     3:00 a.m.  24.Dec.98.PST
     BERLIN -- When Germany's legendary Chaos Computer Club convenes here
     on Sunday for its 15th Congress, the atmosphere may be more emotionally
     charged than it has been in years. 
 
     The CCC's annual meeting between Christmas and the new year has been a
     holiday tradition since the early 1980s, when hackers and hobbyists 
     would show up to trade tips and passwords. Last year, over 1,500 
     converged on a humble school building in Hamburg for three days of hacking
     workshops, and lectures on topics ranging from lockpicking to social
     engineering to the history of German Net culture. 
 
     Late in October, however, one of the CCC's most accomplished hackers, 
     Boris Floricic, who had taken the name Tron, was found dead, hanging from a
     belt strung from a tree in a Berlin park. He was 26. 
     
     (This sounds like auto-erotic asphyixiation to me but that could be 
      staged and the Police would know this too... - Ed )
 
     The mysterious and as yet unsolved case is eerily reminiscent of the death 
     of another CCC associate, Karl Koch, nearly 10 years ago. Indeed, Berlin 
     police were quick to call Tron's death a suicide, as Koch's had been. But
     the CCC, as well as Tron's family and friends, have vehemently denied that
     suicide was even remotely in his nature. 
     
     Unlike Koch, Tron was not only a well-balanced personality but also a
     brilliant hacker. He was the first European to hack phone cards so that 
     they could be used freely and forever, and had figured out a way to make
     ISDN phone calls tap-proof. 
 
     "Often, he was the focus of attention,"  remembers Heinrich Seeger, a 
     Hamburg journalist who has covered many CCC congresses. "I guess one of 
     the reasons for that, aside from his undebatable genius and expertise, 
     were his good looks and his charm, which made him stand out." 
 
     Despite ruling the death a suicide, Berlin police have assigned eight 
     officers to investigate, noting more than a few oddities about the case.
     Although Tron appeared to have hanged himself, for example, his feet were
     firmly on the ground. German newspaper and television reports have suggested
     that considering the potential value of Tron's knowledge of smartcards and
     telephony, organized  crime may have been involved. 
 
     Two hours are slotted on the very first evening of this year's CCC Congress 
     for a presentation of what is known about the case, as well as a discussion 
      of the dangers in cracking valuable secrets. "We know the police will be there,
     but they won't be presenting any information," says CCC spokesman Andy
     Mueller-Maguhn. "Our position has always been not to do or say anything that
     would hinder their investigation." 

     Nevertheless, given the CCC's firm and publicly stated conviction that Tron 
     was murdered, the evening session will hardly be a dispassionate one. "I'm 
     anxious to know if the CCC's version of his death differs substantially from
     the police's," says Seeger. 

     The CCC had already planned to convene in Germany's future capital rather 
     than Hamburg before Tron's death, but now, with the fact that Berlin was also
     his hometown, this Congress promises to be more intense and more somber than 
     the others preceding it.

     Hacking for Human Rights?
     by Arik Hesseldahl  

      9:15am  14.Jul.98.PDT
      The reclusive leader of a Chinese hacking group
      that last year claimed to have temporarily disabled
      a Chinese satellite is now forming a new global
      hacking organization to protest Western
      investment in the country. 
      
      In an interview with the Boston-based hacking
      collective, the Cult of the Dead Cow, the hacker,
      who calls himself Blondie Wong, said the new
      group is forming in the US, Canada, and in Europe
      to take up the cause of fighting human rights
      abuses in China. 
      
      Wong, a dissident astrophysicist living in Toronto,
      said that the new group -- known as the Yellow
      Pages -- plans to target companies doing
      business with China, and possibly attack their
      computer networks. 
      
      "Many of these companies have computer
      networks and there are a lot of members in the
      Yellow Pages who have excellent hacking skills,"
      Wong said. 
      
      The interview was conducted by a former United
      Nations consultant known only as Oxblood Ruffin.
      The group provided Wired News with an advance
      copy of the interview. 
      
      In the interview, Wong seemed unconcerned about
      any damage or monetary losses that might result
      from a network attack carried out by the Yellow
      Pages. 
      
      "Human rights is an international issue, so I don't
      have a problem with businesses that profit from
      our suffering paying part of the bill," he told
      Oxblood. 
      
      As leader of the Hong Kong Blondes hacking
      group, Wong has the credentials to back up his
      threats. With members operating inside and
      outside of China, the Hong Kong Blondes claim to
      have found significant security holes within
      Chinese government computer networks,
      particularly systems related to satellite
      communications. 
      
      The group claims it first announced itself to the
      government in Beijing last year by temporarily
      disabling a Chinese communications satellite -- an
      incident never confirmed by the Chinese
      government. 
      
      Since then, the group has threatened to cripple
      certain Chinese military and security networks if
      human rights issues in China reach what they
      decide is a critical point. 
      
      Members of the Cult of the Dead Cow said that the
      organization began advising the Blondes on strong
      encryption and network intrusion at the annual
      "Beyond Hope" hacker conference held in New
      York last August. 
      
      In the interview, Wong details how he saw his
      father stoned to death by members of the Chinese
      Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, the
      period of political chaos that engulfed China during
      the 1960s and '70s. 
      
      Later, as a student attending an unspecified
      university in the Great Britain where he was
      studying to become a teacher, Wong describes
      watching televised images of the 1989 massacre
      at Tiananmen Square. 
      
      "When the tanks went into the square and began
      shooting and running over people, it was like I was
      a little boy again, watching my father being killed,"
      he told Oxblood. 
      
      Wong claimed that the Hong Kong Blondes has
      doubled in size, with 42 active members operating
      in China and other countries. Many of the group's
      newest members are Chinese government
      employees, whom Wong describes as "technical
      people." 
      
      One member, a female hacker known as Lemon
      Li, was detained earlier this year and has since
      been moved to Paris with the help of a group
      Blondie described only as "a group of people even
      more outside the law than we are." The same
      group provides Wong with an armed escort
      wherever he goes. 
      
      The interviewer, Oxblood, said he knows little
      about the origin or membership of the Yellow
      Pages, other than that the organization was
      founded recently by students at Cal Tech. 
      
      "Blondie wants anyone who agrees with the
      strategy of attacking American companies doing
      business in China to get involved," Oxblood said.
      "So starting new chapters is really up to whoever
      gets inspired, making membership open to
      anyone." 
      
      Sun Microsystems, Lucent, Motorola, Yahoo, and
      Excite are among a growing number of American
      companies active in China. 
      
      As for any current or future activities of the Hong
      Kong Blondes, Oxblood said the group has been
      patiently watching and waiting. 
      
      "They have gotten to the point where they can
      pretty much hack everything that is up and
      running. [Wong] is pretty tight-lipped about what
      he's got planned. I would say though, that the
      Blondes have the capacity to snap the backbone
      of the Chinese end of the Net."

     MCI WorldCom network virus
     may be inside job 

     Telecom giant calls in Network Associates' emergency response team to
    stop virus from spreading.

    (Updated) December 22, 1998 Web posted at: 4:10 PM EST 

    by Ellen Messmer 

    (IDG) -- A new strain of computer virus that attacked MCI WorldCom's
    internal business network of NT servers may have been started by a
    disgruntled employee, MCI WorldCom has acknowledged. 

     The company, which is in the midst of layoffs, said they are 
    investigating the possibility of an inside job. The strain, which is 
    believed to be the first NT-hosted virus, was first detected last 
    Thursday. It corrupts files and encrypts data, making them unreadable. 

    MCI WorldCom spokesman Jim Monroe, who declined to offer much detail
    about the virus attack, claimed that it "has had no serious impact on 
    MCI's ability to deliver service to its customers." However, Network 
    Associates, whose antivirus emergency response team was called in to 
    help MCI WorldCom with the incident, said that the virus, dubbed Remote
    Explorer, wreaked havoc on files in hundreds of desktop computers 
    connected to MCI's large NT-based network. 

    "We've never seen anything like this in 10 years of doing business," 
    said Peter Watkins, general manager in the security division at Network
    Associates, about Remote Explorer's modus operandi. Network Associates
    believes it is the first totally NT-hosted virus that spreads by 
    exploiting a network's features in order to corrupt files or lock them
    up through encryption. Weighing in at 125 kilobytes, the virus acts like
    a network administrator run amok. In fact, the artfully crafted virus was
    probably deployed on an NT server within the unlucky organization by an 
    inside employee, say Network Associates experts still studying the case.
    But it remains unclear whether Remote Explorer can penetrate an organ-
    -ization without inside help or if this malicious code is yet up on 
    hacker Web sites. 

    "This is a very sophisticated virus written by a knowledgeable person 
    familiar with business processes," explained Vincent Gullotto, manager of
    the Network Associates antivirus emergency response team. "It's the
    first NT-hosted virus we've seen, and the virus uses the network to spread
    into the NT programs." 

    Remote Explorer, which has to somehow be installed in the NT driver 
    subdirectory, acts  like an NT remote management monitor, sits in on 
    sessions, gathers data and impersonates a network administrator, Gullotto 
    said. "The virus emulates a network administrator and gives itself as many
    rights as it can." The virus is intrinsically different from any other 
    virus spotted before because it doesn't spread through more traditional
    means, such as floppies, or through e-mail as macro viruses do. 

     "If you discover it, it won't let you get rid of it by just shutting
    it off," Gullotto  warned. The virus, formally called 4.03r.sys, carries
    a Microsoft DLL with it, and if you try to delete it, it simply creates 
    another DLL. The Remote Explorer virus corrupts HTML and other types of 
    files through data-compression routines or encrypts them so they can't be
    read. It does not, however, appear to actually delete the files it attacks
    or to cause other mischief, such as reformatting a hard drive. 

    The virus was designed with a time routine that causes it to do damage
    between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m., as well as all day Saturday and Sunday-times
    when few people may notice it on a binge. 

    "It corrupts data so it's not usable, but we have developed a cleaner to 
    cope with this," Gullotto noted. Network Associates is updating its 
    VirusScan product with an antidote to counteract the virus's damage. 
    Network Associates believes its antidote will even "make the system immune
    from it," Gulloto added. The antidote will restore files and decrypt files
    that were encrypted by Remote Explorer's 608-bit encryption component. 

    Remote Explorer doesn't appear to infect Unix or spread through Unix, 
    though Network Associates is still running tests on a variety of Unix 
    platforms before it issues a final determination.

    So Back Orifice wasn't enough of a potential trojan
    wake up call to corporate America running their critical
    business apps on NT networks. Most companies and
    most NT administrators don't understand security well
    enough to effectively secure their networks. UNIX
    admins know not to run untrusted software as root. Do
    NT admins think about this or are they running the
    lastest email attachment their buddy from college sent
    them?

    Check out this funny quote from the CNET story: 'This

    that attackers are as good as a certified NT
    administrator.'

     Preface: This is long rambling and philosophical. It does not give any
     info on the latest hack or attack, and is no way meant to have any
     technical merit.  If that didn't make you hit D, read on...
     
     
     Most of you know me. I've been on IRC for roughly.. too long. And been an
     oper since the first big euro/us TS/NDCD split.  I've been involved in
     taking out fludnets, co-founding bH, working on the botwatch lists and the
     spambot channels, being the routing secretary, co-adminning operlist, and
     several other tasks I can't even remember any more all to try to help this
     lovely thing we call Efnet.
     
     The funny thing is, I haven't chatted on IRC for about two years.
     
     I mean, I've been on IRC the whole time basically, but in retrospect, over
     95% of my IRC conversations start with a user, oper or admin saying "Can
     you help me with....."  It's all about me klining a bot, helping a user
     get a channel back, answering questions about clients, servers, links, or
     hackers, threatening to get smurfed (or worse), showing someone how to
     bothunt, answering e-mail on why my bot kickbanned them, or something
     else.
     
     I never actually chat.
     
     About two months ago my work schedule got really hectic and I basically
     fell off the edge of the IRC world. I was working about 14-16 hours a day,
     and just had no time to idle on IRC.  A few weeks into it, I emailed the
     frontiernet admins and told them to remove my O lines, as I didn't have
     the time for it any more. They, nice people that they are, offered to
     leave them in, so if I ever wanted to come back and help out, I could.
     
     A week or so later, I *DID* get some spare time. I logged in, opered up,
     went to hang out on a couple of my normal channels, and booted up BotHunt,
     an irc script that searches the servers for bots and klines them.
     
     I got attacked about 10 minutes later by some random DoS pup.  Didn't
     actually do anything but finally ping out bothunt, but kind of annoying
     none-the-less, as they did send a floodnet after the client.  So I, like
     loyal little oper I am, compiled a list of the flood bots, klined all I
     could and sent the rest to botwatch.
     
     And stopped coming on IRC again for a bit. I mean, why bother. I just get
     questions I don't have time for, requests I can't help on, and attacked
     for simply enforcing the server rules. Why do people even bother to come
     on IRC anyways, I thought.
     
     Oh yeah, to chat.
     
     A couple days later, I came back online.
     
     I didn't oper up. I didn't connect to a tcm bot. I didn't join any oper
     channels. I pulled MtgMonk out of the oper channels it was in.  I joined a
     couple channels I was interested in (in my particular case, the Magic:The
     Gathering channels), joined, and chatted.
     
     It was pretty cool.
     
     Nobody nuked me. I had a couple great conversations with people on Magic
     theory. I joked around with a few people I knew online, and in general had
     a great time. It was amazing. It's like there's some other world out there
     in IRC. Some world where people don't threaten to take over your channel
     or flood your server, or yell at you for klinigng their bot.  A place
     where accounts don't get , users don't get nuked, and takeovers
     don't happen everyday.
     
     Its a place where people gather, and chat.  That's it.
     
     Its pretty damn cool.
     
     This really is going out to both sides of the fence.  The IRCOpers, and
     the DoS pups.  You want to celebrate the Holiday season this year right?
     Maybe give a gift to the community that accepts you no matter who you are,
     how old you are, or where you live?  Try this:
     
     Try logging on to IRC for a bit as a user.  Don't oper up if you're an
     oper. Don't load the nuker or the anonymous shell you DoS from if you're a
     DoS pup. Just log in, join a couple channels about things you're
     interested in, be it #wrestling, #sandiego, or #people_with_ppodles.
     
     And chat.
     
     And try and remember why you came on to this place to begin with. Not what
     it became, not what *you* became.
     
     IRC, as what its supposed to be, as what its *meant* to be, is really,
     really, cool.
     
     Try it sometime. Try using IRC to *chat*.
     
     Its worth your time.

      The Cyber Army site is a nice site, a bit flash, but nice, they 
     have now released their much sought after (and allegedly already
     stolen and spread) anonymizer source code. After recent events its
     a token of good will to the community and shows who the bad guys
     are once again.

     The CyberArmy crew released today their long awaited source code of
     the CyberArmy Anonymizer. You can hide your real identity with this

5.0  l33t d00d! totally l33t! KILL THE NEWBIES!!!! [ NOT!!] READ THIS.
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      I was (well still am) working on an article concerning this very
     topic for an upcoming issue. There are a lot of differing views on
     the net about the "newbie" you've seen em, they're usually from
     *.aol.com or maybe from *ipt.aol.com AND have a scroller or NUKER
     <GASP an hax0r!> but seriously. often they get flamed or nuked or
     ridiculed and hell, some of these assholes totally deserve the shit
     they get back and well IMHO AOL.COM should be banned everywhere
     not coz of the users but if the fucking admins couldn't handle
     their own dicks in a pissing contest what chance do their poor users
     have with them "showing them the way"? thats like asking Microsoft to
     do a security audit on your NT network. <ahem>     
        
     Anyways as this is a totally no-bs unbiased publication <grin>
     I won't rant and rave, we ALL had to start somewhere and this
     nicely points that out. Check the article below, it was first pub'd
     on http://www.hackernews.com/ in the COREDUMP section. A very good
     and original piece. Permission was sought and graciously granted

     When is the last time that you were just hanging around on
     IRC when you encountered a very lame person. You know
     the type - they talk l1k3 7h1s; they think that the fact
     that they just downloaded the newest ICQ flooder naturally
     means that they now rule the world. 

     Most of you would probably have the same reaction that I
     used to: head straight for ye olde kick/ban button. Wait.
     What if that person you are about to kick could be crypto
     analyzing AES in six months? What if they were destined to
     be the next one added to that large group of people who
     found sendmail bugs? Who exactly are you kicking? 

     I run a hacking website that attracts exactly these types. I
     can't count the number of times that I have received "Do
     you have the latest AOL scroller?" through the feedback
     form. My good friend and site sysadmin tells me that before
     we got the firewall, he had several users break in and start
     by trying to "dir". However, I don't ignore these emails, and
     I don't send back nasty "Go Away" notes. 

     Yes its hard, hell, nearly impossible to imagine, but this is
     the way that a hacker today has to start out. These are
     not the kids who were as lucky as us to have the BBS
     scene and accepting "Mentor"s to teach us. Anyone who
     has the interest and the drive to learn about computers will
     be caught by the media hype and will end up searching
     Altavista for "hacking". 

     When they do that, what do they find? Well--the last time I
     checked--I came up number 5. I'll admit it: by the
     standards of sites like this, mine is seriously lame. People
     constantly tell me: all these files are for attacking. This
     violates any kind of hacker ethics that exist, and they don't
     teach anyone anything. And they're right. So why do I keep
     this page running? Specifically to attract those Altavista
     searchers. Confused yet? 

     I run my site to get people interested. That is my goal.
     People come here and they use these programs. I get 2000
     hits a day from people who want to nuke their friend off
     ICQ. They destroy, they wreak havoc, and they generally
     cause a giant, unforgivable mess. 

     However--maybe once a week--I get an e-mail that asks
     "Is this all there is? How can I go farther? I want to learn
     about computers, UN*X, etc. I want to stop destroying and
     start creating knowledge." By sheer math, that is 1 out of
     14000 people, but it is still one person. I can guide that
     person away from their little GUI world. That one in
     fourteen thousand was ready to move on, and to expand
     themselves. Those that are weeded out by this
     bandwidth-wasteful process have the desire and the ability
     to learn. They all expand beyond my limited knowledge very
     fast. Several have gone on to much better things. All of
     them have been well worth my time. 

     So, you ask yourself, this letter started with some h^c&3r
     coming into my IRC channel. I definitely don't have 14000
     people doing this to *me* a week, so why should I care if
     there are that few real possibilities out there? My response
     is: Can we afford to waste even a single questioning mind?
     The number of people who would call themselves "hackers"
     has grown exponentially on the 'net in the last several
     years. The number of true hackers that adhere to ethics
     and hack only for knowledge and not for publicity or
     bravado has dropped drastically. Do those few who are left
     want their only legacy to be a bunch of kids running around
     with WinNuke? If all the *real* hackers out there don't get
     off their high horses and start teaching a new generation,
     all that will be left eventually will be those "script kiddies." 

     Even the newest hacker has read Mentor's Last Words.
     Some of us know them by heart, and have spent time
     analyzing how we can apply his writing to our actions.
     However, consider his name. He called himself Mentor for a
     reason: he taught people. His values still live on in some
     people, but his idea of raising the next generation is being
     lost, and we *must* fight to keep it.

    Greetings All,

    Due to a hard drive crash, AntiOnline is currently down. We should be
    back up and running the day after Christmas.

    AntiOnline strives for accuracy in all that we report. When we receive
    a tip, we make sure that we double check it with as many sources as 
    possible, and talk to all sides involved. Unfortunately, some of our
    colleagues in the field do not follow the same dedication to accuracy
    as we do. The Hacker News Network received an email from some "hack 
    group" who apparently noticed that we were down, and decided that they
    would attempt to gain a reputation for themselves by claiming that they
    were the cause. HNN decided to post the claims of these hackers without
    so much as an email to us, much less requesting additional verification
    from the hackers. It saddens us that the Hacker News Network has decided
    to follow nothing more than the standards of tabloid journalists.

    To all of our regular users, you can be sure that AntiOnline will cont-
  **-inue to be THE ONLY news source in the world dedicated to bringing you
    the latest news from the underground and computer security scene in an 
    accurate and timely manner.

    Oh, and one more thing. Look for the new AntiOnline, dubbed The 
    AntiOnline Network, on February 16th.

     Shoot the messenger
     update by demoniz at Dec 24 , 0:59 CET

     100 % Pure Bikkel has been accused of being responsible for
     defacing the Web site of Slampcoach.com. The abuse team of
     PSInet contacted our hostprovider with the request to remove this
     site and take proper actions against the webmaster (me.) A classic
     case of shoot the messenger. The accusation of the abuse team
     was based on the fact that I reported about the compromised site.
     PSInet claims to have contacted the FBI. Yeah whatever.

     Read my reply to the abuse team of PSInet:

     
     Dear Net-abuse team,

     I received a complaint from the owner of bikkel.com regarding the 
     compromised server of www.slampcoach.com. I would appreciate it if
     you could refrain from any unsubstantial accusations. According to the
     information which was sent to our hostprovider (WideXS) you accuse the
     bikkel.com members being responsible for this hack. This accusation 
     rests on the fact that my user account (http://www.bikkel.com/~demoniz/)
     was mentioned on the defaced Web site. For your information: I'm the 
     webmaster of a popular news site for the hacker scene. I report on a 
     daily base about various exploits/bugs/hacks. We're dealing here with
     a classic case of 'lets shoot the messenger since we have noone else to
     blame.' I don't want to be disrespectful, but your investigation of this
     particular hack is anything except thorough. 

     You wrote in your complaint:

     >> If you go the website http://www.bikkel.com/~demoniz/, there is 
     >> mention of our customer's website getting hacked. Please see the 
     >> following contents found on that site.
     >> -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Since you obviously visited my site, you should know that this particular
     quote is taken from a copy of the hacked site which I received. You can 
     find the archive of the hacked site here: 
     http://www.bikkel.com/~demoniz/hacksite/slampcoach3_com.html

     Maybe you should also take a look in the directory /demoniz/hacksite. 
     You'll find many many more archived hacked sites. Why?
     Because it's an _archive_ of hacked sites. Those pages aren't written by
     me, but are copies of hacked Web sites. I merely report about them.

     Since you had your finger on the trigger to bring charges against me
     (and punish me [start quote] PSINet is requesting that the following 
     website be removed and action taken on the users responsible [end quote]),
     I assume you will be just as quick with your apologies.

     Thank you for your time and I'm looking forward to your apologies.

     Kick Ass Demoniz, some people are just so ... well you know.

     From: John Carlton <techhelp@ROCKETMAIL.COM>
     Subject:      Freestats.com CGI vulnerability
     To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org

     About a year ago I developed an exploit for the free web stats services
     offered at freestats.com, and supplied the webmaster with proper code to
     patch the bug.  After hearing no reply, and seeing no fix in sight, I've
     decided to post it here.

     Procedure:

     Start an account with freestats.com, and log in.  Click on the area that
     says "CLICK HERE TO EDIT YOUR USER PROFILE & COUNTER INFO"  This will call
     up a file called edit.pl with your user # and password included in it.

     Save this file to your hard disk and open it with notepad.  The only form
     of security in this is a hidden attribute on the form element of your account
     number.  Change this from *input type=hidden name=account value=your#* to
     *input type=text name=account value=""*  Save your page and load it into your
     browser.

     Their will now be a text input box where the hidden element was before.
     Simply type a # in and push the "click here to update user profile" and all
     the information that appears on your screen has now been written to that user
     profile.

     But that isn't the worst of it.  By using frames (2 frames, one to hold this
     page you just made, and one as a target for the form submission) you could
     change the password on all of their accounts with a simple JavaScript function.

     Any thoughts, questions, or comments?

     CompSec specialist.

    From:         Tatu Ylonen <ylo@SSH.FI>
    Organization: SSH Communications Security, Finland
    Subject:      security patch for ssh-1.2.26 kerberos code

    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

    This message contains information relevant to people who compile ssh
    with --with-kerberos5.  There is one or more potential security
    problem in the Kerberos code.  These issues are not relevant for
    people who have not explicitly specified --with-kerberos5 on the
    configure command line.

    Peter Benie <pjb1008@cam.ac.uk> found a buffer overflow in the
    kerberos authentication code.  To quote from his mail:

    > What about sshconnect.c, line 1139
    >
    >     sprintf(server_name,"host/%s@", remotehost);
    >
    > where remotehost is (char *) get_canonical_hostname() (up to 255 chars),
    > is copied into server_name (a 128 char buffer)?

    It looks to me like this is a genuine buffer overflow.  I had not
    noticed it when going through the code.

    This buffer overflow is, however, extremely hard to exploit:

    1. The victim must have have client compiled with --with-kerberos5 and
       --enable-kerberos-tgt-passing.
    2. The victim must be connecting to a server running with the same
       options (i.e., krb5 with tgt passing).
    3. You must do the following DNS spoofing:
       - fake reverse map for the *server*
       - fake forward map for the fake reversed name
    4. You must fake your attack code to look like valid DNS records; this
       is highly untrivial with modern versions of bind that reject all
       domain names with invalid characters in them.
    5. Only the part of the DNS name beyond 128 bytes can be exploited; that
       must be made to align with stack frames and must contain appropriate
       return addresses and jump addresses.  It has been shown that this can
       generally be done, but the space and structural constraints here are
       extremely tight compared to most instances of buffer overflow
       exploits.
    6. Since the client with Kerberos TGT passing is only used
       interactively, the user will almost certainly notice that something
       went wrong.  I don't think you can, within the structure and space
       constraints, construct the code so that the user would not notice at
       least the client crashing.
    7. You cannot try again after a failed attack until the client again
       tries to log into the same host.

    This might yield an attack against the *client*.

    I've fixed this in the source tree.

    I'd like to thank Peter for reporting this.  A fix will be included in
    the next release (which I expect in about a week).

6.2  Think Twice Before Becoming A Hacker Attacker

     Think Twice Before Becoming A Hacker Attacker
     RUTRELL YASIN 
     December 14, 1998 

     I'm a big proponent of self-defense. Having studied a few of the martial
     arts, I've learned the value of being prepared to fend off and respond
     to attacks. To paraphrase a famous activist of the '60s: If someone 
     attacks you, make sure he can't put his hands on somebody else.
   
     That appears to be the stance of a growing number of large companies that
     have been victimized by hacker attacks, according to extensive research
     conducted by WarRoom Research.
   
     In an 18-month study of 320 Fortune 500 companies, 30 percent said they
     have installed software capable of launching counterattacks to security
     breaches. The report, titled "Corporate America's Competitive Edge," 
     focuses on security and business intelligence practices and will be 
     available next month.
   
     Most security experts agree that companies should have some way to
     strike back at hackers. They caution users, however, not to get
     embroiled in cyber shootouts. The main reason? The system you're
     aiming at might not be the culprit.
   
     The concept of "strikeback" has been around for years, but the method
     gained wider attention over the past few months after the Defense
     Department used software to disable an attacker's browser.
   
     Strikeback can take many forms-from the collection of information
     about intruders that can be used later to launch a counterstrike or put
     the culprits in jail, to the launch of debilitating countermeasures such
     as denial of services or flooding attacks that virtually shut down an
     attacker's system.
   
     But a savvy hacker can forge packet headers to make it appear that an
     attack is coming from another location. And if a company is shooting
     first and asking questions later, innocent people could be hurt.
   
     What's ominous about the WarRoom Research findings is that many of
     the companies in the security study would prefer to use their own
     strikeback methods as opposed to calling the FBI or state law
     enforcement agencies.
   
     As WarRoom Research president Mark Gembicki pointed out, a code
     of ethics controls how government agencies use strikeback measures.
     Large companies are truly borderless and are moving into uncharted
     territory.
   
     Ken Geide, section chief of computer investigation with the FBI's
     National Infrastructure Protection Center, agreed.
   
     "It's really important that companies have the capability to detect 
     efforts  to break into systems," he said. But strikeback has possible
     drawbacks.
   
     "The consequences of strikeback has the potential to put the victim at
     civil risk or physical risk," Geide said.
   
     The companies in the WarRoom study view strikeback as a right, just
     as the law protects physical self-defense by way of force.
   
     But there are lessons from the physical world that IT managers should
     consider before launching a strike, experts said.
   
     If you see someone trying to break into your car parked at the curb, do
     you have the right to get your gun and take a shot at the suspected
     thief? Geide asked.
   
     The person might be intoxicated and just stumbling on your car, not
     actually intending to break in. Worse, the bullets may ricochet and hit 
     a bystander.
   
     "Our recommendation would be to let a properly trained individual help
     protect the property," Geide said. IT managers should adopt the same
     kind of response when conflicts arise in cyberspace.
   
     "They could be launching a strikeback against themselves. The victim
     is better off working with law enforcement," he added.
   
     Geide said, however, that companies have been reluctant in the past to
     tell law enforcement about security breaches, fearing unwanted public
     exposure. Just as technology continues to advance, the FBI has grown
     more sophisticated in investigating computer break-ins. "We're
     cognizant of the concerns of the victim. It would be silly to victimize 
     the victim twice," Geide said.
   
     As a result, the FBI has seen a nearly 200 percent increase in pending
     investigations, primarily as referrals from victims, according to Geide.
   
     It's clear that more large companies are devising options and plans to
     address network intrusions-from both internal and external attacks.
     Many are deploying tools that block or kill TCP/IP connections when an
     intrusion is detected.
   
     Those considering counterstrikes should realize that we're a long way
     from being able to effectively verify that we're hitting the right targets.

     ok This is NOT an anti-drug article, but if it makes you stop and
     think then it was worth while. First off, its not just bums and
     welfare people or blacks or <insert your biggot ethnicity> that end
     up becoming alcoholics or drug addicts, I've known Doctors, Cops,
     lawyers, business men and many computer professionals who have fallen
     prey to this trap these are smart people.

     Anyway so wtf do I care? well i'll tell ya wtf I care, been there done
     that and i'm still here. used to play Suicidal Tendencies "Suicidal 
     Failure" and think it was funny ya big hahah h0h0.      

     Anyway the point is this HACK YOUR BRAIN. Not not with a hatchet fuck
     wad, get wit da program, get some fucking root man, GOT ROOT? no? ok
     try VALERIAN ROOT, if you're a raver, its sedating, makes the colours
     go super cool, neat visuals and its a herb. also take GINSENG in tab
     form and also if you can stand the taste (its pretty kewl actually)
     buy some ginseng drink from your local Korean variety store its like
     speed that shit keeps ya going for about 2 hrs and yer mind is unfucked
     ... try leaving the mdma bullshit at home sure your head ain't scared of
     dying but guess what the rest of your body is and fuck man you'd piss 
     off people you didn't even know were your friends if u deep-6'd it on 
     the dance floor, (thats rude) you'd look pretty rad then huh? End of 
     rant, check this out:

                                        rave or someone elses friends/family.

                                        I hear hacking websites is IN these
                                        days least you can't get killed too
                                        quickly.
     I think it makes me look cool      You will look very cool, stone cold
                                        and unless you're cremated you'll stay
                                        that way forever.
                                        
     


     What are my creds? oh how about 12yrs of lost life, 5 dead friends, a 
     lost house, AA ppl, NA ppl, the Police, Emerg and Shrinks know me on
     a first name basis. That enuff? fuck you if you think this is shit i'm
     taking the opportunity to put this out and thanks to Cruci for being
     there for me, if it weren't for him, FProphet, Dicentra, Vexxation
     and their families I wouldn't doing shit now cept watch worms crawl.
      
     One last story before I go. 
     
     There was a guy that had a fantastic time but had too much to drink
     he took his buddies keys and took off home in his car, hit another 
     car on the way home "fucking bummer" he thought, turns out that car
     wiped out and smashed head on into a lamp post <yikes> so some woman
     and two kids got killed just coz he was stupid enuff to get totalled
     and drive home.
     
     Next day his wife and kids are nowhere to be seen, but the police were
     in the driveway. Guess the ending? ya, that was his own fucking family
     he wiped out.
     
     Merry Fucking Christmas.
     Hope you all got the picture.
     It ain't cool.
     But the music is.
     fuck i'm like 27 now and things rock
     i'm still alive and life is great
     but the things that coulda been ... make me break up now and then
     btw: those frame sites piss you off here's the url for Bikkel's
     webboard http://www.bikkel.com/~paradise/webboard/ sans frames...

     
     
     
     To end on an upbeat t0ne, proof i've done the deal ...
     
              "gh0d grant me the serenity
              to accept the things I cannot
              chmod, the courage to not DoS
              although I can, and the wisdom
              to spewf my ip when killing ppl
              off of irc."

     Well not really but a good way to start hacking your head, also you
    might want to look into n00tropics (nutropics). Use your favourite
    search engine and look up "nootropics and nutropics".

    The links will no longer be maintained in this file, i've decided
    to put up an indexed link list of reference material and current
    hack and security sites on our web site instead of eating room in
    the newsletter. Hell my search engines file is around 200k in and
    of itself with just about every search engine/device out there
    "stolen" mostly from spyking and other places of course. That won't
    be up for some time though, i'll dig up the links to the sources as
    well if I can find and verify them within a reasonable time with my
    robot.. - HWA `Staff'.
