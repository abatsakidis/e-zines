Editorial:                                                                    
                                                        
        I came to a realization after my much troubled and depressed freshman 
year: Teenagers suck.  What I mean is that for all are bitching, whining and  
"experimenting" nothing good comes from it.  So the next time teenage angst   
came looking for me, I told it to go to hell.  It told me to get lost.  Now   
I'm beyond lost.  Wasn't that poetic?                                         
        Looking back at that last paragraph makes me again think of teenagers 
and my intolerable hatred for them, most possibly because I am one.  I hate   
what I wrote, not the content but the style.  Too bad it's mine.  Enough self-
reflection.                                                                   
        Emotion is something that I seem to lack, except in sporadic bits of  
pain and pleasure that happen during a moment.  During a moment may sound like
the present but is most defiantly the past.  A tough idea to fathom?  Maybe.  
I don't get depressed anymore for than 5 seconds at a time, it succumbs to    
this new feeling of hollowness, which I identify with being beyond lost.      
        Will I always be lost?  That’s the very reason I hate teenagers with  
all there, "My parents are divorced", "I shoot up heroin", "All my friends    
suck", whineologies.  Teenage angst should never be pitied, it should raise   
anger.  The thing is that 99.99% of what most teenagers do is totally         
pointless and doesn't make a difference and they’ll denounce most of their    
choices and beliefs once they are "grown up".  When your beyond lost, it takes
so much effort just to get to the point of simply being lost, but you'll      
prolly get out of it as soon as you conform or grow-up.  As if there is a     
difference.                                                                   
        Hmm.                                                                  
        I reflect back at what I wrote and realize that this idea is just too 
much for me to put down in words at this moment, but it is most defiantly     
real.  Too make it simple: I've seen the world, and man in particular, through
my own tainted view and have acknowledged it as such.  I don't find anything  
at the root level of mankind to be "there" enough for me to show more emotion 
or expression then one can muster from the expansion of the moment.  Nothing  
makes me really happy or sad, no extremes.  I miss the extremes.  Perhaps     
being hollow or empty is a form of depression, but if this is so, there is    
most defiantly a schism going on between them and modern man.  If your empty  
your not depressed, I swear.  It can be confused with depression but it lies  
in its own glorious realm of pain.                                            
        One last example.  A friend of mine, whom I believe is also beyond    
lost, had an abortion.  Boohoo, right?  Not really.  To get it out of the way,
no I'm not the father you yucky minded people.  Was this a sob story?  No.    
The pity people gave her, she used either as survival, playing off it, or     
totally dismissed it.  I did not pity her after the first moment of my        
knowledge.  Moments can be dangerous.  We named the fetus and played games    
with it and made jokes, and not to cover up uneasiness, but because we did.   
That's are identity, more true in public charades then we can feel in are     
solitude.  Then she had the abortion and it was other, she didn't cry and I   
believe it when she says she doesn't harbor any hidden sadness agenda         
[Sadness Agenda?  Sounds like a Smashing Bumpkins song!] or whatnot.  I never 
felt bad about it or the games, it was occupation in a dull world.  I miss the
extremes.  I did feel bad however, I think I did anyway.  I didn't feel bad   
about what I had done, I felt bad about how I should of felt for what I have  
done.  So I emulated the pain, or the "feeling bad".  Well, emulation is used 
a lot, and very well in are race, defiantly to a potion where most are        
ignorant of it.  What I did above most people do, but hide it so much.  I     
define emulation as artificial means to getting the real thing or a reasonable
facsimile.  We don't love, hate, shame, or anything anymore, except during    
those dangerous moments that soon leave.  We emulate are emotions, we are     
becoming machines.  You shouldn't make fun of people who practice             
self-mutilation, pain is a very real thing and it can make a moment linger, a 
very hard trick to do.  Cause when the moment fades your left with a memory,  
that can be fuel for the emulation process, but itself a very poor imitation. 
        So in summary, most are already beyond lost but find their way back in
the falsehood of familiarity known as conformity.  The rebellion gene, like a 
match, bursts into a furious uproar for a short time, the teenage years, and  
quickly dies down with only a few cherry embers left.  A few can keep lighting
matches, and these are the people that don't exist.                           
        Well, enough philosophy for right now.  So what will Beyond Lost be   
about?  I'd like to make into an omniscene e-zine for 203/860.  So that means,
humor, computer stuff, phracking, music, art, and coding.  Just remember who
you are and how much it hurts to be a thinking machine, if you let yourself
really think.  Pain be good gumbo. :)

I know some people have been asking about running UNIX but they don't want to
give up DOS and they say they can't find WABI or SoftWindows and they don't
have money to pay for those programs and blah blahabalah...

Well here's another alternative.  Go to 
http://cccsat.sorostm.ro/pub/simtelnet/gnu/gnuish/ms_sh and you can get a
unix-like shell for DOS and some unix-like programs that run in DOS.  It's
nothing compared to real unix but maybe it's a place to start.  Also, I wrote
a cheesy little lpr program in C.  It works find on my printer but I seriously
doubt it would be great for the masses (I wrote it cuz there was no lpr in
those unix-like utilities).  Well, here it is if you want:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void prn(char *argv);
void frmt_pg(void);
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   if(!(argc == 2 || argc == 3)) {
      printf("\nUsage: lpr [-e] <filename>\n");
      exit(1);
   }

   /* I should have used pointer notation to throw off any new C
      programmers :) */
   if(argv[1][0] == '-') { 
      prn(argv[2]);
      fputc('\x0C',stdprn);
   }
   else
      prn(argv[1]);
   return 0;
}

void prn(char *argv)
{
   FILE *fptr;
   char buff[81];
   int lcnt=0;
   if( (fptr = fopen(argv,"r")) == NULL) {
      printf("\nCould not open file %s\n",argv);
      exit(1);
   }
   frmt_pg();
   while( fgets(buff, 80, fptr) != NULL) {
      fputs(buff, stdprn);
      putc('\r',stdprn);
      if(++lcnt == 58) { n_pg(); lcnt = 0; }
   }
   fclose(fptr);
}

void frmt_pg(void) {
   int i,j;
   for(j=0;j<4;j++) {
      for(i=0;i<81;i++)
	 fputc(' ',stdprn);
      fputc('\r',stdprn);
   }
}

void n_pg(void) {
   int i,j;
   for(j=0;j<4;j++) {
      for(i=0;i<81;i++)
	 fputc(' ',stdprn);
      fputc('\r',stdprn);
   }
   frmt_pg();
}

Feal free to modify it.  I wrote it in 5 minutes and then debugged it in
another 5 minutes so I'm sure it's nothing great.  The n_pg() and
frmt_pg() functions do a little formatting that's probably specific to my
printer.  I'm not sure.. I really don't know much about printers since
I've only had one for about three weeks now but if you print something
more than one page on mine, when it starts printing on the next page, it
loses about 2 lines of text (this is when doing a simple "type <file> >
PRN".


Here's something that goes good with that little notice about UNIX utilities
under DOS:

In continuing with making DOS look more UNIX-like (really, get the shell and
utilities I told you about if you can't give up DOS), here is a man program
for DOS which I whipped up.  This time it took me even less time and I'm not
a great coder so I'm sure there's improvements but it works.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <conio.h>
#include <string.h>
/* Change this to the path to your man pages */
#define MANPATH "c:\\usr\\local\\man\\"
/* Change this to the extensions on your man pages */
#define MANEXT ".man"

void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   FILE *fptr;
   char count=0;
   char buff[81] = MANPATH;
   char *file_ext = MANEXT;

   if(argc != 2) {
      printf("\nUsage: man <command>\n");
      exit(1);
   }

   strcat(buff,argv[1]);
   strcat(buff,file_ext);
   if( (fptr=fopen(buff,"r")) == NULL) {
      printf("\nman: no man entry for %s\n",argv[1]);
      exit(1);
   }

   while( (fgets(buff, 80, fptr)) != NULL) {
      fputs(buff,stdout);
      if(++count == 21) {
	 printf("\n--More\n");
	 count = 0;
	 if(getch() == 'q') exit(0);
      }
   }
}

If you have access to a UNIX box, you can borrow their man pages.
Unfortunately, if you do a "man <command> > <file.man>" you will get a bunch
of escape codes in there.  You can easily circumvent this by piping it through
col.  Exmaple: man diff | col -b > dif.man.  You'll probably want to put in
linefeeds for dos too right now.  On connix the program to do this is called
bsd2dos and most boxes have some type of program to do this.  Here's a
finalized example so you don't get pissed because you have to think:

   man diff | col -b | bsd2dos > diff.man

If you know sed, you can filter the control shiz out that way too.

Also, through Altavista, I have been able to find a version of Awk, gzip, 
gunzip, vi, uuencode, uudecode, and sed for DOS.  [The version of C I got also
comes with the god of Unix commands, grep!]  Pretty soon your computer will be
quite mutated.  oh, the MS-SHELL I mentioned can be very usefull although it
does have one bug that I discovered.  When exiting my TC++ IDE, my computer
will hang.  Also, batch programs run a lot slower and if there is a directory
with tons of files, the ls program sucks.  Nevertheless, it has many
advantages also and you can easily just type exit and you're back in DOS.

/*
     rm2.c
     compile with "gcc -o rm2 rm2.c"

     I know this is quite lame but it could come in handy for someone who
     would like to delete a file which they have write access to and is
     owned by another user and resides in a world writeable directory with
     the sticky bit enabled (like /tmp). 

     It actually doesn't delete a file, but resets the file to 0 bytes,
     destroying any data previously in the file.

     Note: File deletion is based on the current directories permission,
           not the files mode itself.  In this aspect, the sticky bit is
           useful for files with correct permissions.

*/

   #include <stdio.h>
   #define MAX 80      /* increase for large filenames */

   int main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
      FILE *fptr;

      if(argc != 2) {
         printf("\nUseage: rm2 <filename>\n\n");
         exit(1);
      }

      if( (fptr = fopen(argv[1],"w")) == NULL) {
         printf("\nCannot remove file %s\n\n",argv[1]);
         exit(1);
      }

      printf("\nFile %s has been destroyed\n\n",argv[1]);
}

/* 
    Oh yea, I forgot that you could just do a wc -l on the file, vi it,
    and then just ndd it and then save it (where n is the number of lines
    wc reported).  oh well.. if you're in this area code you probably
    don't gno how to use vi anyways and would prolly just pico it and then
    block the whole file and kill the block and then save so I guess this
    would save you a lot of time after all. [Isn't he cute folks?]

    The lesson to learn here is that the sticky-bit is not some god-like
    permission that will keep your files safe.  Vorrect file permissions
    should always be present.  Not that this hasn't been known for some
    time but rybread needed more stuff for his e-mag and I wasn't about to
    let that space be filled with ANSI art or shit like that! :) [ANSI? Never,
    though maybe an ASCII...]

/*
   Ok, so I was sick of not generating any good code for you and just
   getting something that "worked" so heres an addition to that shell
   for DOS that I'd say *is* good code and optimized.

   Since cls isn't a DOS executable, when you load up the UNIX shell
   for DOS, you have no way to clear the screen.  The utilities package
   don't have a clear program either so I wrote this one.

   I know it'd be easier to use the clrscr() function but I think this
   might run faster than that.  Anyways, I was bored and felt like I had

        (4000 bytes for an 80x25?  Yup.  2 bytes per character...char and
         attribute...((80*25)*2)...)

       Building on what we learned last time, we can stow our binary text
image at $B800:0000, since VGA text modes are, under normal conditions,
defaulting to page 0...

      Every 100% compatable VGA card can move it's internal "where do I
start" pointer to wherever you want in the $B800 segment...this is how we do
our scrolling...we can take an 80x100 ANSI, and use the
pseudo-socially-acceptable TheDraw program to convert that bastard ANSI into
binary format...you should have a 16000 byte binary dump now.

      BINOBJ that bastard, move the image with a swift
"move(@yourimagehere^, mem[$B800:0000], 16000)" to the jaw...from here, you
need to access the video offset register.  Code to do this is included in
BIGBOOTY.PAS, of course.  It's straightforward assembler...don't get too
confused now.

        We sync to the VSYNC in there to smooth things out...I'd recommend
NOT including it in there, and sticking it in manually, but hey, thats YOUR
perogative.

        You feed the register (or the procedure in this case) an OFFSET into
the video ram...so, if we wanted to flip between page 0 and page 1, we can do
this:

                setoffset(4000); {page 1}
                setoffset(0);    {page 0}

        You can do some nifty tricks with just that for some cheap high-speed
text mode animations...double buffered text mode game...not to shabby...try
it.  NOW....GODDAMN YOU!! WRITE IT!!!  COME ON!! ABUSE ME!!!!!!!
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.............


        <cough>

        Anyways...to SCROLL downward, we can do this:

                {------------}
                var
                   y:byte;
                begin
                    put_that_bitch_ansi_into_video_memory;
                    for y:=0 to 99 do setoffset(y*80);
                end.
                {------------}

       And off it goes...kind of makes a tear fall into my
beer...<sniff><sniff>...*sigh*...oh well...

        So...in the end:  EXAMINE THE PROCEDURE...it's mostly
assembler...KNOW WHY IT WORKS...and for GOD SAKES STOP TOUCHING ME THERE!

>Well, first off tell me a bit about yourself and what you (any others?) do? 
                                                                             
I am a former software engineer.  I have been in private practice for the past
three years.  I handle approximately 50% criminal & 50% civil (mostly         
plaintiffs cases & computer contracts).  I represent several small and medium 
sized software companies.  I work alone.                                      
                                                                              
I have represented several hackers of the past year.  Fortunately I was able  
to keep their cases from ever going to trial.  One case involved a Ph.D.      
student in Electrical Engineering at a major University who was hacking a     
system in Canada through an anon server.  He was tracked down and the police  
were notified.  We kept it to a level where he was made to do 40 hrs community
service by the University - no other record or punishment.  The student was   
quite fortunate.                                                              
                                                                              
Before entering the law I worked in the computer industry for approximately 10
years employed as a systems manager, programmer, analyst, and a consultant.   
Enjoyed the work, but I realized, none of the attorneys I spoke with knew     
anything about computer law.  I figured I would jump in and try it.           
                                                                              
Anything else?                                                                
                                                                              
>You have defended hackers, but have you ever defended any phreakers, ones    
>who mess around with phones, Ma Bell, and the like?                          
                                                                              
No.  The closest I have come to those issues is advising drug defense         
attorneys on federal agencies who access cell phone records (how its done,    
what the legalities are, etc.).                                               
                                                                              
>Do you have any feeling on knowledge and if and how it should be distrubted? 
>In other words, can you condone hacking?                                     
                                                                              
I disagree with the left wing hacker who feels everything belongs to everybody
and knowledge should be free to all.  Seems to me the communist tried that on 
a grand physical scale and their economy & government collapsed.  Knowledge is
acquired only after someone has  worked hard to achieve that knowledge.  The  
knowledge someone acquires will eventually be public domain, but the person   
who spent time, money and/or other resources acquiring that knowledge must be 
rewarded, otherwise what incentive is there to acquire knowledge.  I spent 5  
years in undergraduate school, 3.5 years in law school and over $50,000 to get
the degrees I have.  Why would I do that if I then had to give up what I knew 
for free.  There is no incentive.  The "knowledge is free" concept is         
basically the same thing Karl Marx suggested decades ago.  However, as the    
Russians found out, you must give people an incentive to work.  No one works  
for the good of all society.  They work to improve their position in life.    
Why would companies spend billions of dollars on R&D and then give away what  
they discovered?  They certainly would not be in business long if they did.   
                                                                              
When it comes to the government I feel that the knowledge/information they    
have should be free and open.  But let me qualify that statement by allowing
an exception for national security issues and personal information.  But for  
all other information - our tax dollars helped to create that knowledge and we
therefore are entitled to it.                                                 
                                                                              
As to condoning hacking.  I feel that hacking serves a purpose.  You learn how
things work.  You learn strengths & weaknesses of systems.  You become        
knowledgeable.  Hackers should put their skills to work.  Work with other     
hackers, learn their skills, attack their systems (with permission).  When you
are good enough, work with businesses to improve their security and systems.  
Many businesses pay hackers to expose their weaknesses and help them resolve  
problems.  Hacking is nothing more than pushing the envelope to discover new  
methods of doing things.                                                      
                                                                              
However, hacking a system without permission is illegal.  I do not condone    
unpermitted access to another's system.  This crosses the line from hacking to
"cracking".                                                                   
                                                                              
>Also, what is your ideal political structure?                                
                                                                              
Our current form of government with changes.  I would make it where the       
government is not as involved in every aspect of our life.  The more          
government does, the less it does well.  Our forefathers only intended our    
government to do those things that we as individuals cannot do (i.e. National 
Defense, build roads, provide public services).  It seems that present day    
government has gotten into everything and we have the tax burden to prove it. 
The federal government has also undertaken an area of law it has no business  
in, criminal law.  When the constitution was written there were only two      
crimes - Piracy & Treason.  The federal government now has criminal laws for  
everything, basically duplicating the laws of each state.                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
>How do the statutes of limitations work on hacking?  After 8 years your      
>innocent or something like that?                                             
                                                                              
That is a very difficult question to answer because statutes of limitation    
work differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from law to law.  In   
other words, what may be the statute of limitation for Alabama on a particular
crime, may not be the same in Colorado, or in the Federal jurisdiction.  Also,
by committing one illegal act you may have violated multiple statutes with    
varying time limitations.                                                     
                                                                              
It would be safe to say that limitations on prosecution vary from as short as 
1 year to indefinitely.                                                       
                                                                              
>How much do you bill an hour?                                                
                                                                              
My rates vary.  For non-computer related cases I charge $100/hr out of court  
& $150/hr in court.  For computer related cases or intellectual property      
(copyrights, trademarks) I charge $200/hr out of court & $300/hr in court.    
                                                                              
>You being a lawyer, I was wondering if you would ever let morals get in your 
>way, or do you leave all personal preferences behind?                        
                                                                              
I attempt to leave personal opinions at home.  Every person in the U.S. is    
entitled to legal representation and the best defense possible of any criminal
charge.  There are certain cases that I refuse to take:  Sexual assault (Rape)

those instances and I therefore refer them to another attorney.  Beyond that  
I feel I can give anybody the best defense possible regardless of my feelings.

I once hacked a university's computer at their request.  They were locked     
out of a certain area of their system and could not get back in.  The methods 
I used were nothing fancy and could have been done by anyone with a basic     
knowledge of CIS, but the university was certainly grateful.

Not in the near future.  My caseload has increased dramatically which tends to

I read 2600 to see what the latest techniques are and what the latest         
consensus is in the hacker community.  2600 has a number of qualified and     
impressive contributors, but it also allows a lot of yahoos who merely want to
see what they wrote in print, regardless of the fact that it has no value.    
                                                                              
I have read 2600 only for the past year.  I monitored it across the web for   
about 2 years prior to that.                                                  
                                                                              
>I gotta know your opinons on the Bernie S. saga, especially what you thoguht

I can only say that much of what I have heard reported by various hackers &   
underground magazines should be taken with a grain of salt.  Much of what     
they report is from an uneducated or misinformed viewpoint.  You have to      
remember the federal judiciary is a very meticulous and structured beast.  I
have yet to come across anything like it at the state level.  There are formal
hearings for EVERYTHING!  The protocol used leaves no room for informality.   
So it looks to many who are unaccustomed to this environment as if it is a    
kangaroo court, which it is not.  You really have to listen to both sides.    
Somewhere in the middle ground is the truth.  By saying that I do not mean to 
discount the reports regarding Bernie, merely that you have to carefully      
consider who says what.                                                       
                                                                              
As to the reports of the Secret Service:  I am not surprised.  The Secret     
Service's responsibilties have grown tremendously over the past decade.  They 
are now required to keep up with a high tech area which only a handful of them
truly understand.  They take their job seriously.  And at times, too          
seriously.  You must remember when any law enforcement agency is challenged,  
as with almost any person, they get bent out of shape, bow up and FIGHT.  So  
it does not surprise me that there were some agents who did not fully         
understand the equipment that was involved and what Bernie S. was doing with  
it.  And when he challenged them, they intended on coming out on top.         
                                                                              
Lesson here?  When confronted by law enforcement always take a submissive     
posture and say NOTHING!  Let your attorney handle things.                    
                                                                              
>An opinions on the EFF?                                                      
                                                                              
They are doing a great job - particularly covering legislation that has an    
impact on computers and the Internet.  It seems that both state and federal   
legislators are enacting stupid laws regarding computers just so they can be  
politically correct or known for their "great" service.  But most do not      
consider the ramifications and create a quagmire when the law slams into      
reality.  The EFF has done a great job of not only tracking this, but also of 
getting involved.  More power to 'em.

The program is great!  It will certainly help me in my job by providing       
certification and authentication for computer evidence.  Phil Zimmerman is    
quite remarkable.  He developed this incredible program AND he made it        
freeware.  I think he has moved in the right direction by creating a          
company, marketing his product, and making money.  I firmly believe he will do
well in the coming years.  The USPS is talking about doing the same thing, but
they can't even handle snail mail.  What do they think they can do?  Make the 
Internet slower?  I believe there is a strong possibility that PGP will become
the de facto industry standard.

I don't believe I have a particular favorite URL.  I do enjoy visiting car    
manufacturers' websites.  I also like to visit Edmunds to see the latest      
features, costs, specs on various cars.  I generally just bounce around       
visiting law-oriented sites, technology sites, and whatever else I might run  
into.  I get the biggest kick out of paranormal websites.  I love to see      
where UFOs have landed and are setting up the new world order.  Heck, maybe   
they'll even make me President or something.

Wow.  The possibilities are almost endless.  Especially when you consider     
where we were 10 - 15 years ago.  I remember when I was astounded at seeing a 
10 megabyte hard drive on an IBM PC XT.  Now we have computers with 1000 times
the power.  2 gigabyte capacity hard drives.  ISDN lines.  SVGA graphics.     
Laptops that weigh under 7 pounds.  I am excited to see what is going to be   
available just in the next 5 years.

   Background on the Meriden 2600

        The Meriden 2600 meeting first appeared in the Autumn, 1995 issue of 
"2600: The Hacker Quarterly."  For those who are unaware of what 2600 meetings
are, I would recommend visiting www.2600.com.  The meetings did not last very
long as the IIRG, a Connecticut-based hacking group, withdrew support of the 
meeting.  The quality of the meetings quickly deminished although there still
were a few meetings which were somewhat worthwhile.                          
        In the "last" meeting which took place at Meriden, a person in
attendace called in a phony bomb threat and there was a "mysterious" gentleman
in suit and tie who asked many questions, took notes, and reportedly was seen
entering a "Employees Only" room after the meeting was over.  While this was 
a huge discouragement to the overall underground scene, it was not the only 
thing which took the meetings out of commision.  Obviously the IIRG had     
reasons other than this for withdrawing and I myself noticed a lack of true 
hacker-related discussion going on.  It just seemed like "another place to  
hang out".

        After a long absense due to the previously mentioned problems, the    
IIRG decided to again attend/sponsor the 2600 meetings in Meriden.  The first 
of these meetings was held in January and February promises yet another       
meeting (see IIRG Net 2600 base, www.2600.com, or other for meeting           
information).

   Will it Stand?

        Will the meeting be able to withstand time?  That is entirely up to   
the people who attend the meetings but could there be a moral to the first    
downfall of Meriden's 2600?  In my opinion, here are a few things which hurt  
it that aren't as compelling as the bomb threat and the possibility of a fed: 
                                                                              
        * Lack of h/p discussion and questions being asked.                   
                                                                              
        * Lack of attendance.                                                 
                                                                              
        * Isolation.  This is when one sits with the same two people for the  
          whole meeting.  I know we feel more comfortable with those that we  
          know, but c'mon!

Ok, Threez. I know you wanted a schematic for just a simple project that
makes a noise which you can change yourself.  I'm not a great electronics
person myself but if you have a 10k resistor, 1k resistor, a PNP
transistor, a .047 uF ceramic disk capacitor, a 100 uF Electrolytic
capacitor, a 0.1 uF ceramic disk capacitor, a variable resistor, and some
wires and a box to put it in, mail me and I'll tell you how.  That stuff
shouldn't cost you much and I forgot your email address but I'm sure
you'll read this super-k-rad mag! [So will 2,000 others.]

Oh, here's something cool I found you might want to check.  In unix, elm
should not be setuid except for setuid mail on some platforms.  I know
almost everyone that will read this probably has an account on connix and
they don't have this bug ( ...uh.. anymore. tnx to me) so don't bother.

Anyways, elm has a file include flag (elm -i) which will include a file
into your edit buffer.  If elm was to be setuid root, I could then read
any file on the system.

General Notes:  I was but too happy to snag these files when they came out.
I've graded them 1-10 on the bases of the other cDc files, with a 5 actually
being average, not a 7.  The average of these ten new files is 5.9, and that
seems about right.  Only a couple of hum dingers and no real stink pots, but
a couple that we're slightly smelly.  The bottom header has remains the same
as the 95 and 96 one, sadly absent of any BBS numbers, though I'm aware that
some of them are still up.  Now to the feast, in reverse order cause thats

     Today I will proove that the statement "Anything is possible" is
logically incorrect.  Saying "anything is possible" is the equivilant of
saying "nothing is impossible".  From "nothing is impossible", we can draw
a conclusion that "it is impossible for anything to be impossible".  We
have just come to an extreme contradiction.

Lets look at that statement closely:

 "it is impossible for anything to be impossible"

It is obviously a false statement because you are saying something is
impossible while you are also saying nothing is impossible at the same
time.  Hence, people who say "nothing is impossible" are either full of
shit or the world is in big trouble. [I've had that on my old web page for
almost a year now...]

        Notes Follow

	It was lunchtime.

	Our class walked slowly toward the cafeteria, holding our noses.  We
could smell the food all the way down the hall.  It was making funny noises.

	We opened the cafeteria door.  We took our trays and were about to
line up... when we backed away from the lunch counter in horror! The food was
moving!!  It burbled and glurped in the pans.  Then it slurped out of the
pans, over the side of the counter, and across the cafeteria floor.  It was
coming at us!!!  We through our lunch trays in the air and ran out the door.

	Mrs. Crumb, the cook, ran out of the cafeteria, shouting at the food.
She tried to hit it with a serving spoon.  The food blurped over her white
shoes and she was gone.

	We ran into the main office.  "Call the sheriff, call the sheriff!" we
all shouted.  
	"Now what's wrong?" said Mrs. Bagley the principal.  
	"The food is after us!" we screamed.  
	"Now, now," said Mrs. Bagley, opening the office door and stepping
out.  "There's absolutely nothing to..." GLURP!  She never finished her
sentence - she just disappeared into the bubbling green.

	We ran into her office and locked the door.  Through the glass we
could see the food eating all the safety posters.  We dialed the sheriff.
Soon we heard his siren.  He burst in, took out his gun, and told the food not
to move.  The food moved.  He shot three bullets at it.  "Blup, blup, blup!"
The food liked the bullets.  It happily burbled and chased the sheriff all the
way out of the school.

	We dialed the fire department.  A big red engine roared up.  The food
was eating the flagpole.  The firemen unrolled a huge hose and squirted the
food with water.  The food splashed merrily and took a bath.

	We dialed the army.  A jeep pulled up.  Four soldiers jumped out with
flame throwers.  They turned the flames on the food.  The food warmed up, it
bubbled over boots, and they were all eaten by a /hot lunch/!   We dialed the
air force.  Soon two jet planes roared overhead.  The pilots spotted the food
for our jungle gym.  They each dropped a bomb on the food.  But the food just
burped, then ate the jungle gym, the slides, and all our swings.  We all
screamed.

	Then we thought of Mickey.  

        "Mickey is the only one who can save us.  Mickey will eat anything!"

	We found Mickey licking the snack machine.  We told him what had
happened.  He smiled.  He walked calmly to the center of the playground. He
sat down in front of the food - and took out two spoons.

	The food burbled, and out came Mrs. Crumb.  The food burbled again,
and out came Mrs. Bagley.  The food burbled a third time, and out came the
safety posters and the soldiers.

	The food looked at Mickey.  Mickey looked at the food.  It burbled and
glurped and slithered toward him.  Closer...Closer...  Mickey's spoons flashed
in the sunlight, and...

                                    HE ATE IT!
                                  HE ATE IT ALL!!
                                HE ATE IT ALL UP!!!
        Then he licked his spoons, twirled them, out them back in his pockets,
and asked for seconds.  We all cheered.

The mayor came.  He gave Mickey a bright medal for saving the school.  Mickey
looked at medal, smiled, and ate it.

Notes:  I got this book in 1986 at a school book fair and have treasured it
since then.  Tis quite a nifty-q book and Jared Lee's illustrations are very
good and I recommand picking the book up if you can.  It's a steal at $2.50
U.S. dollars.  I kept all gramatical stuff the same, using "/" to represent
words in /italics/.  The only thing I changed is paragraphing as the book was
kinda lacking of it.  This talented team also produced another book involving
mastication entitled A HIPPOPOTAMUS ATE THE TEACHER, but I have yet to aquire
it.
