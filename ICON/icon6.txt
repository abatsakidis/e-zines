	it's too late.   it's too late, too late for apologies.  
you can't redeem yourself in these cold eyes baby.  you fucked up.  end of
discussion.  plus, i hate you for it.  don't call me in the middle of the
night and tell me you're sorry, i got work in the morning, i don't wanna
here your shit.  thats why you're gone.  denied.  labelled.  marked.
thats why the operator won't put your calls through after i use call
blocking.  i mean come on.  you can't have me.  it's just too late.  too
late for your whining, too late for your crying, too late for your
yelling, too late for you & your apologies.  and i hope you die, bitch.
connect the goddamn dots.

	and i will issue that restraining order, just you wait and see.

* end of interest in this story, we now take to live to pip the angry youth *

.. . for years, i've always wondered why i only took the clothes off my
male barbie dolls, but i guess now i know.  i mean, i sucked in gym class
but i thought that was becuase of other reasons.  i've always been
truthful on your show and i'd hope i'd get better exposure in the future.
your past actions have been more then dangerous to my reputation if not
severly damaging.  i'd sue if i wasn't such a firm fan.. . 

"mister youth!!! i have a question"
"mister youth!!! i have a question"
"mister youth!!! i have a question"
"mister youth!!! i have a question"

this is dick vertelli inside scooping on pip the angry youths address to
the public in result of a news article published in icon magazine, an
always in the news, shocking on-line magazine.  pip has left the podium
and it seems doesn't plan to answer any questions so we take you live now
to the interview with a members of icon's writing team.

manny; hello and i'm here with skin-head, nazi-verbalist, grand-poo-pah of
the nation ferternity for faggot-hating-antelopes, the f.h.a., two time
winner of the pulizer prize and well documented explorer of information,
icon's main editor of magazine production's insirpation, satan.

	hello, i'm satan, folks, don't be alarmed.  i'd like to clerify a
few things for your viewers at home manny.  first, by saying i didn't
authorize this magazines production, nor did i intend to inspire such a
magazine.  this magazine is totally detached from my production company
venial sins productions, located on 66th and Main, New York, NY.  we're
currently suing icon magazine for a hundred and fifty-two billion dollars.
claims as to there settling-out of court has been rumored, but none as yet
have been made.  

manny; so satan, i mean your a nice guy, why do you think today society
would put the rap on a hard-working man like yourself?

	i'll tell ya manny.  all i do is try to work hard, i got a good,
clean job, and i try to bring home the bacon for the four little devils i
got running around at home.  i love my wife and i treat her good, and i
just want a fair square shot at show business.  when things like this
happen, it's just so depressing.  of course, i'm an easy target, but who
will the government target next!! seinfeld!!?!?  will you let your kids
been born into a world of oppression people i mean come on!!!!

manny; well we'd like to thank you for your time satan, but we have to
goto commercial.  when be get back the oprah-bot-3000 airs her 20
billionth show, having replaced a 90 year old oprah in 2054, and
celebrates with a show containing memorable clips from every season of the
oprah winfrey show.  watch as oprah-bot-3000 sheds her first tears on the
air, thats next on, hard copy.
