"the show: the barrier of cotton candy & a tale of two cities."
by cerkit

	i wish i could wash away the pain.  it sticks around like that
lampshade you never get rid of.  it's a table with three legs.  it's the
driver without the passenger.  it's the nothing, you provide that seems to
worry me.  it's the static on radio and the grey on the television, that
leads me to the same stressful thoughts, everytime.  it's not being sure
where to put a period, comma or exclamation point.  it's the verbal
adjectivalisms that expand the uselessness of the decade.  on the wet
waters of the browning winter park, and the large gun in the driveway.
it's the suitcase of memories.  i want them to lose my luggage.  it's the
parking nature of the ache that pretends it's always leaving but invite
itself all the time., that makes me surer and surer this emptiness won't
exit.

	it's the part of me that died that day.  it's the part of me i
lost.  it's the part of me that was interesting, that kept me breathing.
it's the very core of our being.  it's the finale to the ballet danced
with violent intentions.  it's the horrible sears catalog you throw away.
it's the education you'll never have.  it's.  he's dead, and i'm the
alive, one.. .  or is it, the opposite.  the dark always finds it's way
home. it's the show. 
			friends.

"the more-over: I'M so mcdonalds."
by cerkit

	kindof wanted to tell you today, how great last night was until i
relized how long distance a call that would of been.  think god would
accept collect?  i wonder.  sometimes i dream about the past.  i run from
the future and hide in corners most of you denie exist.  you laugh in your
temple of happiness and question my smiling eyes, where the dead live.
why?  can't you accept my deception of loyalty and find the pain i left
behind for you?  inherit the aged reputation of depression and the
distinction of loss, and become.  call to me.  and you will find that i
was always there, but now, i cannot be.  to you.  i say goodbye.
more-ever, it be forever.  and i'm so mcdonalds.

"the nothing that lives and breathes"
by cerkit

	it's here.  the pain lingers on.  the nothing that resides in your
soul, asleep, it heres the bells and music and doesn't want to wake up.
he's futile and dormant for so long you forget he exists.  but he's there.
sleeping.  waiting.  watching.  sneaking.  leaching from your very
existence the things you hold most dear.  he's got a long black snout and
a grey tongue, his hair is green and the monster has these.. .  these
beady red eyes, that he focuses on you, and he can see right through you.  

	he growls and builds his empire for an enternity.  the nothing
that comes, is being born within me.  and he, is coming today.  he's
waking up to take part in my festival of anguish.  he's the cause.  
but like i said, the bells and music won't wake him.  he's the nothing
that lives nd breathes.
