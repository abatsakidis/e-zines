"salt shaker, dice rolling, posse hounds"
by cerkit

	rewind.  erf.  back time, feeling free in the day of the 'fro.
y0e, drop me back into real-time, meal time, ticket to the game, hi-score,
pinball, reality fame.  shakedown take down, your busted.

	i think macgiver should buy out the stock in crackerjack's, think
all of the money he'd make from life saving inventions produced from
marketting self-made crap out of the crackerjack prizes.  fucking lock
picks, bomb defusers, guns, shit he can make anything out of hair, gum
wrapper, some gum <nice and chewed> and a crackerjack prize.  fucking
whole funiture outlets and clothing stores fully stocked with shit
mastermindly designed and made from crackerjack prizes.

	he'd be a rich man.

"film at 11 with martin braimson, tonite more on the macgiver incident!"

hi i'm martin braimson, and welcome to film at 11.  tonite we have live
film of macgiver breaking into a large crackjacks factory in vermont and
stealing in excess of two million dollars in crackerjacks.  he is
currently in hiding on one of the tropical islands of hwawii just out of
american jurisdiction.  in an interview with u.s.a. cable channel
executive paul radler we got this information:

	"we recieved a pressing e-mail for mister macgiver, and we shipped
it off the topic being old CrackerJacks and you.  We have reviewed the
mail and seen it was a scam impressed by him by icon magazine.  we had no
knowledge of mister macgiver being unstable nor do we wish to commet
futher"

	no one from the editting staff of icon was available for commet
most could barely see us coming to attempt question asking.  a full fledge
interview paying 17 billion dollars to any member of icon publishing
magazine staff, is scheduled to hopefully occur within the week.

	we'll be back after these messages, when we come back oprah, man
or machine.
