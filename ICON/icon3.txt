"u.s.a. nigger"
by cerkit

	fuck them college-born, anti-semite, rock-starish, punk-hick, farm
boy, dirtball, gangbangers who stare down wall-mart employee's and steal
cigarette money from their parents and call themselves "hard".  building
houses out of barrels and chopping down trees so the kids can go log
rolling instead of sledding in the winter.  rat-bastards, and then they
wonder why everyone so fucked up!  becuase of t.v.!  it's television!

	everythings television. blame on the rain!  man.  well hot-damn
freelancing morons, whats happening, welcome to issue three, fergot this
was an editorial.  thats uncommon.  anyway.  on the prior notion that the
objection was based upon, i'm making a notation, that in exclamation
points out direct affirmation of the plantiff's identification and
immoralization of the orion constellation.

by cerkit

	why the fuck is the emulation, so much like my antipication.  and
simplication seems like a means of irratification, and the defintion of
the mission seems like your wish'n, to be made part of the congregation
that made our simplication such a farse of it's own ramification.

	pacifcation of the apathetic maginifcation leads to an erection of
your section, which can be used to perfection.  relaxation is
manifestation of our stations relation to masturbation.  who are we to
free what see, and who am i spy and ask why.  i'm just some guy.

	electricution of the abuse and evasion, helps us with our
defication. elastic plastic would make easier more gastric metric.
but even if we eliminate what we consemate we can't stop it.  it's the
agrivation from the proliferation with no realtion to masturbation, but
rather the hatian who makes jason, no longer in the place'n,  and i can't 
deal with that.

"pearls of shit"
by cerkit

	he was a pearl, he was a jem.
	he was a jewel, he was treasure.
	
	he fell to far off this edge, 
        took a way to drastic measure.
         
	i want him back, but he's lost.
	i want him here, but that won't happen

        memory after memory, day by day
	it's all overlappin'.

	i am nearer to the edge.
	closing in on the it's rim.

	i'll keep getting closer, no matter.
 	i don't want to learn to forget him.
------ -(good)  - ------------------------------------(bye)----------------+

	i recommend sitting close to the t.v. and going outside in the
winter with no coat.  swimming right after you eat and parking in handicap
spaces.  littering, arson, hate, hate crimes, the proliferation of death,
disease, world hunger, despair, poverty, descrimination and abortion.  

	i recommend heart-failure at age 30 from high chelesterole, and
death by spontanious human combustion.  i find five year olds with
semi-automatic weaponry acceptable and actualy sex actions performed
during sex education.  i prepose we legalize all drugs and take off those
silly age, height, weight, & social status restrictions limiting so many
people.  i suggest if retarded or handicapped people want to be treated
equally they start acting like the rest of us.  

	i hope this makes certain the blanket by which our nations warmed
with.
