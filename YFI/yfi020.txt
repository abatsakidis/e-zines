Ok, here's a quick guide to speaking spanish.
Or.. At least an equally ridiculous amalgamation of sylables.


                                  CHAPTER I


      If you are getting a generally MasKuLON feel from a noun, adding a long
o sound to the end should work as a general rule.

Examples:

dicko
macho nachos
macko trucko
axo [axe]
guno
bloodo

      On the other hand if you're getting a generally feminine feel from a
noun, adding a short a sound to the end will do you greatly.

Examples:

breastas
dressa
meaka nachas
compacta cara
biblioteca


                                  CHAPTER II


      Verbs are very difficult.  Yeah.

      Just try to babble a lot and mumble really fast.  Kinda blend in a lot
of 'abas' and 'imos' and rolling RrRRrrRRs.  You should get by alright.


                                 CHAPTER III


      Everything else is shit.  Just try to include 'el' and 'la' in good
frequency and get really loud every once in a while.


                                 CHAPTER IV


Examples of everyday sentences in Hippster-Cool spanish:

Give me your mother.
Give-o tu mothera a mi.

How much for your children?
Cuantos a moneyo con tu childrena?

Give me the money or I'll kill you, fool.
Give-o el moneyo a mi o kill-o youo, foola.

Fuck me, I'm god.
Fuck-o a mi, yo dio.

Sometime, when I'm walkin down the street and I'm just mindin' my own buisness
I get the urge to just.. well.. kill.  So, ya see, your Judge-ship, it's not
my fault really!
Sometime-o, que yo walkimos down la streeta anda yo justo mindamos mi
buisnessa yo getaba la urgeo to justo... wella... killaba.  So-a, yao seeaba,
youra Judge-shipo, it-o's nota mi faulta reallyo!@

SHUT UP.  I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU ARE SAYING.  ARE YOU SURE YOU SPEAK
SPANISH?
SHUTO UPO. YO NO UNDERSTANO AO WORDA TU AREA SAYINGA.  AREO TU SUREA YOUO
SPEAKA SPANISHA?
