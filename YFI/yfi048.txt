The following portion of the report contains comparisons of elements
in your text with those in other texts. "Hmwy" refers to the first
chapter of THE SUN ALSO RISES by Ernest Hemingway. "Stnbk" refers to
chapter 29 of THE GRAPES OF WRATH by John Steinbeck. "King" is the
beginning of the first chapter of THE DEAD ZONE by Stephen King. "Byte"
is the beginning portion of a technical article in Byte magazine. "RD"
is a non-fiction feature story from Reader's Digest. "Time" is a news
story from Time magazine.

These texts were chosen both because they are examples of a variety of
styles and because each is relatively representative of the author or
magazine from which it was excerpted. You should notice that the higher
Readability Index, longer words, and longer sentences of a technical
article in Byte are not what most readers expect in popular fiction.
Notice, too, that the somewhat Biblical style of Steinbeck (relying
upon cadence, repitition, and a low incidence of short sentences)
results in some numbers for his work that prove that style evaluation
does not necessarily reveal anything about content. These numbers are
only the roughest kind of guide to STYLE. CONTENT can not be evaluated
by this (or any other) text group.

The following histogram shows the percentage of sentences of 1-5 words,
6-10 words, 11-15 words, 16-20 words, and over 20 words. The percentages
for the sample texts are given below the histogram.

Mean length (average number of words) of all sentences:

                   ====

The Readability Index is based upon the number of words in your text,
the number of those that are unusually long, the mean length of
sentences, and the number of sentences. Long words are those that have
at least 8 letters (11 if ending in "ing", 9 if ending in "s" or "d").

The Index is equivalent to a school grade level and is intended to
represent the level of education necessary to read your text without
difficulty.

                   18.5    9.6     8.8   10.6   16.0  12.4  15.0
                   ====

WARNING: The Readability Index for this text is higher than is
usually considered desirable. The high index number is attributable
to an excess of long sentences. To improve readability, break some
long sentences into shorter segments.

There are not enough sentences in this text to do a meaningful
analysis of sentence lengths.

                              +++

The ratios appearing below indicate the relative frequency that the
specified circumstance occurs. The ratios for -LY words, -ING words,
and commas have been multiplied by 10 to reduce the number of decimal
places; the hyphens ratio has been multiplied by 100. Compare the ratio
for the text being analyzed to the sample ratios to see if you have
more or less than average occurrence of a circumstance. A higher ratio
indicates a greater incidence of the circumstance.

SUGGESTION: Substituting active verbs for some of the passive verbs

                   ====

SUGGESTION: This text has more ANDs per sentence than average. There
are also a high number of long sentences, suggesting that you may be
using AND too often to make compound sentences. This gives writing a
repititious quality that is not usually desirable.
