now a story by ninja:


 one day i was walking thru the woods.
 the peaceful man that i am, taking a stroll
 and i came upon a furry little baby bunnie that seemed to be lost
 i felt sorry for that bunnie, so i brought it home
 and i cared for that bunny like no other. i fed it, i pet it, i even clean up its doo-doo.
 and one day, i realized that i didnt really like that bunny.. so i took it outside.
 AND I KICKED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF IT!@#!%^!
