LORDLASER HERE WE THINK KOJAJ IS REALLY SMART AND HE GAVE US STUFF
SO HERE IT IS ENJOY!@@!


i don't understand the whole concept of bringing about 
repressed memories.  the notion of paying someone hundreds of 
dollars an hour to talk to you about your past, and try to find 
out what's so horrible about it, sickens me.
        the human mind blocks out certain bad memories for a 
reason.  when something bad happens to the body, the mind 
automatically goes into a self-preservation mode by blocking 
out the horrific memories.  selective memory is not something 
that should be tampered with.  the body knows itself better 
than any psychologist ever could, and it knows that mental 
re-enactments of these situations will only do the body 
damage, not harm.
       the entire "fad" [and that's what it is] of having 
someone reach into your past to tell you that you had a rough 
life and don't remember it is pointless.  let's take roseanne 
for example.
        this woman has a wonderful career (at the time all 
this happened), and is making a wolloping amount of cash each 
day.  then, one day, she goes to her psychotherapist.  after 
an hour or so, she comes out a neurotic woman with a blemished 
past.  "my parents sexually abused me", she says.  where did 
this come from? there's no way of proving beyond a shadow of a 
doubt this is true, because there is no evidence.  if she was 
sexually abused and her body tried to forget what happened, 
why did her "therapist" bring it back up?  since this point in 
time, roseanne's family life has disintegrated into 
nothingness, and this "revelation" she had has brough about 
nothing but hardships.
        this is just one example of a growing number of people 
who have selective memories until that secret door is unlocked 
by a professional.  it's an invasion of psychological privacy, 
and i'm totally against it.
