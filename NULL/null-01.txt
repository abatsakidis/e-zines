 welcome ::

       thanks for taking the time to read this, i hope it is as enjoyable for
 you to read as it was for us to produce.  krieg and myself will/should be
 releasing null every so often. you can always get issues direct from me via
 email or you can subscribe to the mailing list. paying attention to grammar
 just screws up my entire train of thought, so i dont worry about it. and if
 you ever were to submit something to null, you dont have to bother with it
 either. now i cant say that i dont love writing all this stuff with the help
 of only one other person, but i really enjoy seeing other peoples writings,
 so if you have something, no matter how stupid or deep, send it, use an alias
 i dont care, its fun!

      if you want to subscribe to the null mailing list, email oceans@gate.net
 and in the body of the message simply type "give me null!" without the quotes
 obviously. i'll post a homepage address for the null page next issues, i'm
 not quite done with it yet.

      with that terse introduction out of the way let us proceed. oh, and if
 you were wondering what the heck null was, its a electronic magazine devoted
 to anything. its fun to write, it gives me something to do in spare time and
 i can finally write something without having it graded. oh well, on to the
 euphoric lunacy. enjoy.

 1.0.3 - beef stew is good . myrddin

    ah, wonderous stew! how much i lub you. carrots, potatoes, beef and beans,
 you add to the sauce such wonderous things! cooked on a stove, out in the
 woods, a waft of your smell, floats over the grove.

      you are so good, on a cold winter night, on a warm summer day, on a red
 leather kite! stew are you, and you taste good, i dedicate this now to the
 delicious stew, whom i dub, harry.

 1.0.4 - a review of pearl jams 'no code' . myrddin

      all together, an awesome album. ever since i bought my first cd ever,
 'ten' when i was like 11 or something i have loved pearl jam. they rock
 live, i love thier sound and lyrical value. this wasnt a letdown like 'vs'.
 a lot more percussion on no code, sounds great, get it today! ****

 songs to listen for : sometimes, smile, off he goes and lukin. although all
                       the songs of the cd rule. just like 'ten' .. 
 
-<--------------------------------------------------------------------------->-

 1.0.5 - late breaking, earth shaking news! . myrddin

 i wish i had some, darn, i was really excited about this section too. oh well
 maybe i'll have something import to say next month, most likely not. *sigh*

 1.0.6 - damn cops! . myrddin

     anyone who skateboards in areas that have cops know what im talking about.
 skating in an empty parking lot yesterday i was havin fun, not bothering a
 soul, there wasnt even a car within 50 yards of mine. as i was working on my
 heelflip i noticed a cop bout 200 yards from where i was. not wanting to leave
 i simply continued skating. he drove over on his way out, and blubbered the
 famous :

  " now listen, i dont want to have to arrest you, so stop skating and leave "

     laws suck. one of these days im gonna go down to the station and check out
 if there even is such a law, we'll see. anyway, its not that i dont understand
 why they make us leave (laws, stupid laws). i just think they could be a lot
 cooler about it.

      fact is, they have the thought that "all skaters a punks" when they come
 out.  now i know a lot of skaters are, but im not, my pants stay above my ass,
 i dont dress like some gangster, far from it. i look more like poindexter then
 a skater, but im not, and i never will be poindexter, hehe. i have a 4.0 gpa
 and never get in trouble. and yet, the instant i jump on my board, im a
 bonified gangster punk who's gonna beat up old ladies and rob from 711's. bah.

      oh well, there isnt much i can do about it.  i live in a really small
 town, with a very large police force. maybe someday we'll get a better name
 or at least in-liners would get the same cop-hated status :) that would make
 me happy. whatever.

 1.0.7 - the lyrics to call any vegetable by frank zappa . myrddin

      i love this song so much, i just thought id share the wonderful lyrics
 with anyone who hasnt heard the song. its off of the mothers of invention,
 " absolutely free ".

 call any vegetable, call it by name
 call one today when you get off the train
 call any vegetable and the chances are good
 that the vegetable will respond to you

 (some people dont go for prunes..|
 ..dont know, ive always found that if they..)

 call any vegetable, pick up your phone
 think of a vegetable lonely at home
 call any vegetable and chances are good
 that the vegetable will respond to you
 rutabaga, rutagaba,
 rutabaga, rutagaba,
 rutabay-y-y-y...

 (a prune isnt really a vegetable..|
 cabbage is a vegetable..)

 no one will know
 if you dont want to let them know
 no one will know
 less its you that might tell them so
 call and theyll come to you
 smiling and covered with dew
 vegetables dream, vegetables dream,
 vegetables dream, of responding to you
 standing there shiney and proud by your side
 holding your joint while the neighbors decide
 why is a vegetable something to hide?

 a lot of people dont bother about their
 friends in the vegetable kingdom. they
 think: oh, ah, what can i say? what can
 a person like myself, say to a vegetable?
 but the answer is simple, my friends:
 just call, and tell them how you feel
 about muffins...pumpkins...wax
 paper...caledonia, mahoganies, elbows
 ...green things in general...and
 soon, a new rapport...you and your
 new little green and yellow buddies,
 grooving together..oh no! maintaining
 your coolness together! worshipping
 together, in the church of your
 choice...(only in america)...

 call any vegetable, call it by name
 you gotta call one today
 when you get off the train
 call any vegetable
 and the chances are good
 WOW! that the vegetable will respond to you!

 oh no! can you see them responding? the
 pumpkin is breathing hard...h-h-h-h
 h-h-h-H-H-H-H-H-H - H - HHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
 (what a pumpkin!)

 the toilets at track meets, and know that a track star let out a truckload
 after an 880 relay, or somethin. i guess i am obsessed with toilets. they 
 are soo beutiful. yes. i have more fish in the toilet than the aquarium.

 1.1.5 - king mongolious . krieg

       Prince of the apes, king of monkeys, king mongolious was a proud 
 gorilla who was coo. One day king mongoli was sittin around when this
 creep came up to his camoflouge tree house and wanted in. This freak was
 Rif of the fox tribe (yes!!). Well Rif was a very proud dude. King 
 mongoli took of his trowsers and dropped some urine on Rifs new spring
 coat!. Shit Rif yelled as the urine splashed down. "You want shit well here
 " yaked the king. Suddenly a huge elephant that was made out of shit, and
 some rocks hit Rifs tale. Rif ate the elephant and almoast killed the king
 with his hideous breath. The king loved the smell so they became friends.

 1.1.7 - the million dollar man . krieg
 
 Once apon a time there was a homeless millon dollar man. He couldnt see, that
 made him blind. One day he lost his cain. Some Polish woman gave him a hug.
 He fell in love with her. She told him about some of her inventoins. One was
 a silent radio, another was a solar powered flashlight. The last, and 
 best was her water proof sponge! (i made up 2 of theese). She was a real 
 smart blonde. She had chronic urine syndrom. The millon dollar man had to
 sleep on a different bed. Hers was one big toilet. A little rabbit named 
 skunny ate her urine. It smelled good. Skunny met his own wife in the toilet.
 She was a virus that lived on urine. Skunny beat his meat until his half
 virus, half wife went onto his urine.
                                                   
  ::krieg:: hey spankey, get outta da bathroom!

 1.1.8 - the adventures of tar boy . krieg

 uno comade was a tar boy. he wanted to become a tar-baby when he grew up.
 instead he became a laughing blodo. he went down the streets of kilan-brools
 jive'n in monkey jive. yeah this dwip-wick named joe thought he could eat 
 a whole slice of pizza. well i think you know what happened to little joey!
 he scarfed one of them peper-owni-s and hacked into the internet. after 
 his geek-lizard gave out and then he had to bathroom. that was when the
 flying whumpus looked in his window. it stared for 5 hours at little joey.
 that kid must of been wetting his p-j's all night. in the morning the nurse
 ate his bed-pan. she had tar on her skirt, which reminded joe of his best 
 friend tar-boy. joe ran for the door, but the whumpus broke through the
 window and grabed him with his snufolufigus device. 
                                               
  ..krieg ..umm its 2:00am, dont bother me.. 
  ahh i think a whumpus is in my window!!!!!!!!

-<--------------------------------------------------------------------------->-

 1.1.9 - definition of a whumpus . krieg

 a whumpus is a weird creature that is part elephant, part snufolufigus,
 part teddy bear, and part elephulumph. it drinks water and eats water.
 one day a big red cloud of morons came down to earth. this little frog-boy
 threw a rock at it. these cool guys said that he had a frog-arm. they laughed
 and kicked his ass until they heard his skull cry uncle. and the wind cried 
 mary. the red cloud of morons went into frog-boys body and helped him to 
 become more of a freak. now he was cool. freaks rule, but not the kind that
 try to grow sunflowers under your computer, and on your pillow. because this
 happened to me, and every morning the sunflowers on my pillow combed my hair.
 i cut them down, because i dont want to go to school looking stupid with 
 combed hair.

-<--------------------------------------------------------------------------->-

 1.1.10 - glooev . krieg     
      
      slaads and sligs are farms for rodent maggots. they chew thier ice cream 
 off of the bean trees. The yellow bunny named donney went to school just to 
 eat lunch with his pal, wog. wog eas eating pepper one day when donney brought 
 in a block of chalk. they ate the block in one minnite and eleven secys. i ate 
 chain mail once and a little boys rotten glove. he sold it to me for negative 
 one hundred dollards. it was a deal. i wrote on my pencil that it was my 
 friendy. i then ate it. that night when i was asleep a big blug slaad came 
 and ate all my hair. i didnt mind until everyone thought i was normal, i 
 wanted to be a freak like everyone else. i ate black jello and declared myself 
 an insane dwarf. I saw this groovy green slig hobbling down the wagon trail 
 that went down to the rotten lagoon. that is when gliham murh the snrf god ate 
 my shoes. i think it was fun to follow the slig with bare feet. i touched the 
 sligs back, and it cut off all my fingers. it was so funny. i liked to watch 
 my fingers fly into the sligs mouth. we had a picknic. he shared some of my
 fingers with me. they were so good, i cut off my toes. donkey corn grew next
 to the inn, called the flying platypuss. i heard a of a dragon that ate corn.
 i then saw corn being planted. i sat in the corn field for a month until the
 corn grew, then killed it all. my village suddenly went poor, i dont know why.
 corn costs alot now. i want my bunny blanket. chocklate charm elves cast a
 spell on my fogwathian pet named blurrf. he is green. he is a kid, that is
 fifty years old. i ate the rest of my ice cream from a year ago, and let out
 a satisfying ogg.
                                    
  ..krieg.. humble wizard noblag, please grant me my frog. oK>?

-<--------------------------------------------------------------------------->-
      
      thats all really, we had fun just releasing this issue, feedback from
 peoples on what we should or could do is nice to hear. either way, thanks
 for reading and look for the next null release in a couple weeks.
