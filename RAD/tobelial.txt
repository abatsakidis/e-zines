H> i like mercuri, he's really cool.

    mercuri and i used to get along _really_ well, but then like when slinky 
came out, he and i have just been having a little problem.  it's nothing big, 
but like... there seems to be some kind of tension.  dunno.  i like mercuri 
too, he's pretty cool.

belial.

H> oh. cerkit (i think) is that guy that hates me (one of many) on irc.

    i've come to the conclusion, that besides my obvious friends, i'm not very
well liked on irc either.  it appears that my good friend, mercuri, has turned
all of them against me.

BH> well, okay, then what is in the zines. mostly stuff of non-sense, non-sense
BH> stories. right. not all, but the most of them i read. i'm not dising zines 
BH> #zines, because i like zines and i enjoy hanging out in #zines when i can, 
BH> i havent for about a week know, since of baseball.

    ahem.

    'zines are great, #zines _used_ to be great (however, it is getting better
once again.), and the entire 'zine scene is great.  recently, it has gone 
through some trouble, it is in a transitional state.  a whole new group of 
'zines are coming in and changing things  -  or as mogel said it 
"revolutionizing" the 'zine scene.  then you have butt-faces like mercuri who 
are instigating fights between the different 'zines, which i believe sucks.  
    
    none of it is non-sense  -  at least not the stuff coming from the people 
who _care_ about it.  you need to experience it first hand to understand what 
it is all about.

C> well you seem to be his main competition or something... i see slinky, rad,

    perhaps... but i don't think slinky is at the same level of those 'zines. 
they are all good 'zines, but... i think slinky has an edge on them.  don't 
get me wrong, it is just something that _i_ feel.

        I thought _I_ was paranoid.  Instigating fights?  You know damn well
the most I have ever done to you belial is given you a review on slinky01.
And you took that review as an attack to your writing ability or something,
I'm not sure why you took offense. WAR.  and for dislexix's: .RAW

        I don't understand you man, I'm here like everyone else.  You're
acting like tell cerkit that you called him a LaMeR, and I told you that
cerkit called you a Big Kiss Ass.  This has just gone one step too far, you
have dealth the last hand, I don't feel like apoligizing for things i havn't
done anymore.

        Life's sucks, get a fucking helmet.

It all fits into my pyramid of 'Zines -

                                    Jonas
                                 DTO - Slinky
                       RAD - Chemical Chocolate - y0lk
                   Dogma - Other Ansi 'Zines like Superflu
 
See?  You're a _whole_ tier above RAD and Chemical Chocolate!  You have 
(straight) edge!

        Does this chart seem just a BIT inbalanced?
        
        In short, your acting like a baby.  grow up.

        Oh, and i have yet to talk to someone that thinks slinky is better
than rad.  Or even someone who thinks its as good as your editors think.

        ISSUE ONE; BIG INSIDE JOKE NO ONE UNDERSTOOD
        ISSUE TWO; GOT A BIT BETTER...

        Then this whole thing about the 'zine scene getting out of control...
yeah.. okay.. sure.. whatever.  things about the 'zine scene losing its
quality... think about it... why does it suck all-of-a-sudden?  does it even
suck?  and as far as revolutionizing... what is changing, ?  all these ansi
'zines that started?  jonas was an ansi 'zine, and it SUCKED, just nothing
but a bunch of quotes from irc in the first issues, programmed in Qbasic.
But look at it now... definetly one of the better 'zines.  so all of you,
this goes to everyone... just relax,.. let everyone do what they want to do,
your pointless bitches & rants don't help the 'zine scene at all.  me?  i'm
just getting a damn point across.

        FIN.
