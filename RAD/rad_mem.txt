 "aardvark industries"
 created by - handle & mercuri

 point three score, and zero years ago, our forefathers brought forth on this
 continent a new 'zine.  founded on the principles of aardvarks, dung, and
 the pursuit of wackiness.  in order to form a more perfect 'zine, we the
 council of raD members have formed an organization of the elite, to help
 govern the way we all live, to spread the teachings of raD, and to reach the
 ultimate goal of mercuri's life dictatorship over the american empire.
 thank you, buckle up and drive safely.
