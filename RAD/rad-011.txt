 "where did i come from?"
 written by - handle

        my life is utterly horrible.  want an example?  well just a few
 seconds ago i was reading relish6 when my mother came into my room.

 *shudder*

        oh, yeah.  she came in without knocking too.  that's just the kind of
 person she is.  anyways this is how the conversation went...

        "nate, i'm going to walgreens.  stay here because i'm leaving your
         sister.  i'll be home soon.  do you need anything?"

        "..."

        "..."

        "..."

        "are you ignoring me?"

        "yes."

        "why?  is something wrong?"

        "i always ignore you.  please shut the door on your way out."

        instead of leaving like i requested she decided that she would be
 better off reading what was on my computer screen because she has no life
 of her own.  we've lived in this town for ten years now and she has yet to
 make any friends.  that's how likeable she is.  anyways, i'm getting off
 topic.  what was on the screen was this . . .

  "Halloween.  The simple mention of the name calls to mind demonic
  hellspawn & Satanic minions stalking the Earth to sip the blood of
  fetuses & rape small kittens.  Err, well, I guess that Halloween calls
  that stuff to mind of SOME people.  I guess I just wanted to say that
  there's more to Halloween than taking a dump in your Grandpa's mail..."

        after about twenty-five seconds she had gotten down to the second
 line and said...

        "santanic, *gasp*"

        and no that wasn't an error, she actually said santanic.  besides
 being an annoying bitch she is also rock stupid.

        "please leave, mom."

        "are you crabby today?"

        god this has to be the worst question anybody could possibly ask you.
 what could make your demeanor more unpleasant than being asked this
 question?

        "i wasn't until you came in here."

        "why are you being so hateful?"

        i wanted to tell her that i hated it when every so often she'd start
 to feel guilty about ignoring me my whole life, and would try to act
 concerned.  but i couldn't, showing no emotion at all was just the thing to
 spite this hell demon.  and don't think i'm trying to gain sympathy by
 saying my parents don't love me.  not paying any attention to me was the
 best present my mom could have given me growing up.  i can't stand her
 presence.

        just then my step-dad came in and inadvertainly broke the ice by
 jerking around like there was a bee in his pants, grabbing my mom's head and
 pretend hitting it saying, "i'm gonna thump you".  he also runs around the
 house a lot repeatedly sticking his thumbs in the air and making strange
 noises.  (as i'm writing this my sister just came into my room, saying "i
 heard a funny noise downstairs"  i replied with "no you didn't, you just
 want to come in here"  she then said  "i know, but i like to be in here"
 for some reason she has some strange infatuation with being in my room, it's
 sickening.  she's always trying to come in here, even when i have people
 over.  please excuse me while i forcefully expell her from my room...)

        okay i'm back.  my sister is the only person i've ever met that's
 stupider than my mom.  because of that reason she's always getting all the
 attention, thank god.  if i had to put up with my parents on a daily basis
 i wouldn't be alive right now.  so back to the dialog, after his unbareably
 hilarious display of fake hitting my step-dad said...

        "nate, we're going to walgreens."

        "i heard."

        "he's being crabby."

        "oh really, i'll knock you around so hard..." (jokingly)

        yes, of course jokingly.  i have no loyalty to anyone.  especially
 these two.  if he even threatened me once i'd call the cops before he
 blinked.  thankfully then, the idiot duo left and i felt i had to right this
 to get the anger out of my system.  hope you enjoyed it!

        things are really fucked up these days.  the other day my cousin
 called up my brother on the telephone and she started hitting on him and
 eventually asked him out.  back in the olden days, my brother would have
 been the one calling my cousin.  damn feminist movement.  it all started
 with women's suffrage, then it all went down hill.

        it's getting to the point where they don't even want to have they
 babies anymore.  they just want to chew tobacco and milk the cows -- "just
 like the guys."

 "imperial butter!"
 submitted by - mercuri

        remember those commercials from the mid to late 80s for imperial
 brand butter?  the kid would wake up in a dead sleep with a craving for some
 butter.

        "tommy, get in bed -- now!"
        "but, mom ..."
        "put that stick of butter down and get to bed!"

        if my calculations are correct - and he is still consuming butter at
 the same or faster rate he is probably in the mayo clinic right now.

        "you really need to cut down on your butter intake."

        and what the hell was with that crown?

        <fanfare> "imperial butter!" *poof* "gasp!  a crown!"

        butter must make you rich or something.

        on the same note, i wonder if zack is still a lego maniac?

 "pubes"
 submitted by - handle

        note from handle: in RAD 10 metalchick gave us a really embarrasing
 poem that cerkit wrote.  well, after reading it i immediately recognized
 that cerkit gave me a poem also; it was very similar to the now famous
 "3 stars."  i'm guessing it must be a sequel.  so now for your reading
 enjoyment, the sequel to "3 stars," "curly pubes!"

 original:                sequel:

 3 stars, i see           curly pubes, i see
 when light is dim        when i'm with my kin
 less one head            i feel two balls
 and less one limb        they slap my chin
 or is it my homeland     or is it my knee pads
 i have lost              i have lost
 i know i win             my knees are sore
 at this cost             at this cost
 let two stars            let dad's penis
 now stand and shine      now stand and shine
 and down into            i do the work
 the dotted line          but i'm getting mine
 we draw this life        i give dad head
 which we share           with no despair
 further into apair       he blows his load
 my eyes now stare        into my hair
 does it end              does it end
 hath it start            hath it start
 is this the middle       is this the shaft
 what is this part?       what is this part?

 or am i him              i release his skin

 "addendum to the 'foon' piece in rad eight"
 submitted by - tmm

        the obviously radical & innovative idea of combining a fork & a spoon
 in one piece of silverware is in no way, shape, form or fashion unique to
 mercuri's brain. in fact, a similar invention, which was invented in the
 forties for soldiers in world war two (which dumbfounds me even more because
 of all people, mercuri should know this) has been in production ever since.

 the name of this subversive piece of machinery is a "spork," not a "foon."

 in fact, the only "foon" i see here is mercuri, who is a "buffoon" for 
 saying such ignorant things.
 
 oh yeah, the spork was discontinued from mass production in the mid-eighties,
 the sales were paltry.
 
 but you can still find them today in a friendly non-biodegradable plastic 
 form at kentucky fried chicken.
 
   * authors note: some people asked me how i know this. well, my grandfather
 was the inventor of the spork, & my father carried on the family tradition 
 until our family business went under in the mid-eighties.  we've lived in 
 poverty ever since. so fuck you, mercuri.

        man those people over at disney are so lucky.  they get to have a
 twenty-five year anniversary every year and i'm stuck with jack-shit.  three
 years ago i'm watching tv, commercial comes on celebrating disney's twenty-
 five year anniversary.  two years ago i'm watching tv, different commercial
 comes on celebrating disney's twenty-five year anniversary.  last year i'm
 watching tv, yet another commercial celebrating disney's twenty-five year
 anniversary comes on.  five minutes ago i was watching tv, guess what
 happened?  exactly how old is the disney corporation?

        i've decided that this tuesday will mark my twenty-fifth wedding
 anniversary to my fake wife.  you can all send presents if you want to.

 i have yet to graduate from.  presents would be appreciated.

 "fingering out dirty reds"
 told by - tmm

 point one:

        president clinton met with chinese president jiang zemin last week in
 an effort to boost lagging us-sino relations.

 point two:

        in order to do this, the us must sacrifice relations with taiwan,
 because us-sino relations & us-taiwan relations trade-off.  you can't have
 both.

 point three:

        taiwan is a budding democracy.

 point four:

        president clinton smiled at the press conference.

        what does all this mean?

 conclusion:

        president clinton has turned his back on world-wide democracy & has
 chosen to spend his time (& enjoy it too) with chinese communists that want
 to take over the world.

        using nothing but flawless logic, we can all see that clinton is a  
 communist, & an evil one at that.

 "significant"
 written by - handle

        why do teachers need a lounge?  teaching is their work.  what about a
 bricklayer's lounge?  how about a drive-thru attendants lounge?  you really
 shouldn't be lounging on the job.

 [-----]

     who's the first person to spell it "drive-thru"?  why did everyone
 else decide to do the same?  is it spelled "drive-thru" in the dictionary?
 and speaking of firsts, i wondered what happened the first time someone      
 used the "your mom" comeback.

        "you're such a faggot."
        "your mom."
        "where?"
        "huh?"
        "what did he mean by that?"

        why did this phrase ever catch on?

 [-----]

 there was a mark
 his mom was a yuppie
 he played in the park
 with a yellow little puppy
 he crawled in and out
 of his very own anus
 which standing alone
 isn't that heinous
 but i think you'll agree
 sticking flashlights in your asshole to collect shit on the end and then
 smearing it on the wall is pretty darn disgusting

 [-----]
        
        why don't white people watch shows like "martin" and "moesha"?
 because they're not good.  they're crap; plain and simple.  why do black
 people watch them?  don't ask me, apparently they have some sort of unity.
 wake up people, theres no such thing as a racist white man.  we can't stand
 each other either.

 [-----]

        bill clinton?  people all over the country are whining about having a
 criminal in the whitehouse, yet he sure did seem to be quite popular during
 election times.  stand up for yourselves.  i agree, clinton shouldn't be in
 the white house.  but not because he's a criminal, you have to be a criminal
 to become president.  we should get rid of him because he got caught.

        electoral votes?  gee, i used to think we voted for the president.
 what's with this?  we all know the president is elected by his fellow
 politicians, so why do we all think it's so important we vote?  i know why,
 so we feel secure.  were not smart enough to rule ourselves and the
 government knows it.  i give them a big thumbs up for helping us out.

 [-----]

        the world is in a state of limbo that hasn't changed for the last 50
 years.  all of our issues are all very petty.  we need a good nuclear war to
 stir things up.  countries taking over other countries, struggling for power.
 that's why god made us, for entertainment.  these last 50 years must have
 been like a commercial for him.

 [-----]

        through the 50's, 60's, and 70's young people fought to not be held
 back and be allowed to wear, say, and do what they want.  well they won, and
 they lost all dicipline.  now us, they're kids, are growing up how they
 would have liked to. there's only one problem.  what do we have to fight for?
 nothing, so we all pretend that we do to be considered cool.  everyone needs
 somekind of conflict or goal and my generation doesn't have any.  that's why
 we've all degenerated into mindless idiots.  i give thumbs up to mtv for
 cashing in on this.

        you can point fingers all you want.  but sooner or later you have to
 face it.  our current situation isn't the fault of mtv or the entertainment
 industry. they're the smart ones, all they've done is take a cut out of the
 cash cow that is our ignorance.  stop pointing fingers and do something
 about it. shake things up, go out and kill someone today.  or at least have
 some fun with a retarded kid -- that will get people's attention.

 "president clinton visited bangkok, thailand this week to meet with the
 king of thailand.  it is the first time in twenty-seven years a US president
 has visited thailand."

 "president clinton is the first democratic president to be re-elected since
 roosovelt."

        no, this is not an article about president clinton.  this is about
 the people who take the time to figure out when the last time something
 happened was.  pay attention to CNN or headline news, & any newspaper.
 you'll see it all the time.

        "this makes it the first time since ..."

        who takes the time to figure this stuff out?

        "i got a real good story i'd like to put on the front page!"

        "when was the last time it happened?"

        "34 years ago!  on a VERY snowy day!"

        "great!  have it on my desk by five!"

        who knows.  maybe i'm just being a little bit too over analytical
 so i have something to write about.

 [-----]

        "he kept to himself.  he was a real nice man, i never suspected a
 thing."

        that's what they always say about criminals.  man, when i move into
 an apartment i hope to god i have the rudest, smelliest, nappiest, loudest
 neighbors a guy can have.  at least that way i'll know they're good people.
