                    bootleg radioactive aardvark dung one
    a "special" issue of raD that includes stuff way too stupid for raD!
                   released march 26, 1996. (c) rad, bitch.

 a few notes.  "ed" who is mention i think twice is a retarded kid, and he
 has this lump of flesh near his neck... where a dog bit him, he refuses to
 tell us why the dog bit him.  but i am determined to find out, i must continue
 to make fun of the less fortunate. he has a gym bag, called "sportif" too,
 he bought it at wal-mart. $17.00, go pick one up.  Not just any gym bag,
 this is "SPORTIF." - mercuri
