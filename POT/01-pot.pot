        Ok folks, this here is sorta like the part where I, (the editor), get

to ramble on about whatever it is I choose to ramble on about...

        What yer looking at is POT number one. Finaly! Well, if you were one

of those people who had been gettin there hopes up, that this little zine

would be a masterpiece or something, I hope yer not too disapointed. As you

browse through our stories and articles, you may notice that there is no comp-

rehensible theme that binds this zine together.  Well, that just goes to show 

you that you missed the whole point of POT!! It's not meant to be a fountain

of information on some obscure topic done by large numbers of Scandinavians.

It's just meant to be an entertaining piece of reading. Sure we got complete-

ly diferent and even clashing topics going on here, but I am sure you can

live with that. Life will go on at least. If you like this. If it enlightens

you in some way. If it brings a smile to your lips. Then I will be happy. Let

me know. Or if you can't find me, go tell your friend you just enjoyed some

REAL good POT!! Tell your teachers! Tell your parents! Tell the world!! Tell

them that you love pot.... Run into the middle of a wide open field, tilt 

your head up sky-ward and yell at the top of your lungs:

        "I LOVE POT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

        I'll be listening out my window for it. Maybe we can get the entire

United States to shout it in unison! As long as I find out that this zine was 

enjoyed by others, I can make sure I get POT #2 out as soon as my poor, tired, 

fingers can manage it...

        Well anyways, as always, you can submit anything you want to POT.

Send it to the POT Head-Quarters, Babylonian Plunder (703)-620-9778.

	(feedback is also always welcome and certainly encouraged.)

        I guess that about covers it. I could go on for hours and mesmerize

you, you've been a terrific audience, thank you, and good night!
