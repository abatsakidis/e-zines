        In response to the public's demand for violence, there has been a
growing trend for violence of a robotic nature.
        All aspects of the media and entertainment industry are alluding to 
this. This concept is not a new one. In fact it has already been proven pop-
ular in the entertainment of the past and present.
        Movies such as "Robot Jox" have won over a cult following. Video-
games of this genra have also proven succesful such as "Metaltech", "Mech
Warrior", and "Nuke'm Duke'm Robots". For younger audiences, shows over the 
years, such as "Voltron", "Transformers", "Go-Bots", and "Power Rangers" have
all been smash hits. Books and games have featuring "BattleTech" and "Robo-
Tech" have met with comercial succes. Toys have have been marketed such as
the plastic boxing game- "Rock'em Sock'em Robots", or our personal favorite,
the radio controlled, "Power Gladiators".
        The event that probably best embodied the robotic violence movement
was the competition called "ROBOWARS" held in California in 1994. This con-
test, hosted by ILM's chief model builder consisted of a giant arena in which
radio controlled metal menaces hacked away at each other using chainsaws,
lawnmower blades, etc.
        What are the factors that contribute to the success of robotic viol-
ence? Well, it all goes back to an ancient Roman tradition of the circus
maximus to please the masses. People enjoyed seeing violence then, and they
enjoy seeing it now. Robot combat brings elements of boxing, fighting, and  
gladiator combat that were popular durring the age of the Roman Empire. But
why use robots as the fighters? Well this prevents humans from being harmed 
which would raise serious morale issues. Also, people are simply attracted to
technology. People find sleek technology appealing and will also be able to 
revel in the challenges of robotic design.
        With all that has been going on in the field of robotic combat, 
perhaps one day, we will be able to turn on the T.V. and see an actual bout
between larger-than-life robots. An entertainment of the variety we call,
"Robotic Violence."
