			  The Government Sucks
			    by: Blood Priest


	 When people speak of turning in criminals, they will often say they

are turning them in to the "authorities".  But this implies superiority, that

the government is higher than you.  You must remember that the government is

comprised of people.  People who are freely partaking in the many things that

you can't do.

        The Government my posess "illicit narcotics" for any purpose it sees

fit.  It can own guns that people aren't allowed to own.  They are even trusted

with deciding who gets executed in some states.  These kinds of things are what

we might expect from an organization of criminals, not from a government that

tells us what is wrong and right. 

        Having anarchy would result in even more violence, because people would

take advantage of absolute freedom.  Eventually, an organization would sieze

control and declare themselves as the government, even if, to rise to power, it

required actions we would consider criminal.  So what can be done? 

	Less government is needed.  If the Libertarian philosophy were imple-

mented there would be as much freedom as possible without being overly oppress-

ive.

        Don't allow yourself to be repressed by a law system that is guilty

of the evils it has set out to punish.  Next election, consider what freedoms 

you have at stake and vot libertarian.




For anyone who wants to know more about the Libertarian philosophy, I recomend

the book, "Dreams Come Due" by John Calt.
