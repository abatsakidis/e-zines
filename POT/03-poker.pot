Death- What do you got?

Satan- Two Pair, Queen high.

Hitler- Ich habe eine pair of achts.

Death- Ha! I beat you all- Full House -nines and tens.

Satan- Jesus Christ... not again! How the devil do you always win?

Death- Its experience my friend....      

Satan- Have you been playing cards for people's souls???

 (Death averts his eyes sheepishly)

Satan- Have you!!??

Death- I got so bored of chess!

Satan- HOLY CHRIST!!! What have I told you about that? Its against the rules

        If God finds out he'll kick my red ass!

Hitler- WarÅbu sphechts dÅ ??

Satan- Nothing Adolph... It doesn't concern you.

Death- I'm sorry, my evil lord, but I.... hey, could you pass the preztels?

Hitler- Ja

 (Hitler passes the preztels)

Death- (munching on pretzels) but I.... can't resist a challenge like that.

Satan- How about this... I find out you do that one more time, and your
        
        fired... gonna accept that challenge?

Death- I'll be good, don't worry!

Satan- Its a serious offense. Its against the divine treaty. If God found

        out, he is allowed to do away with a large evil on earth.


Death- What... like the drug problem?

Satan- Bigger!

Death- You don't mean to say he might abolish the Republican Party

 (Satan nods)

Death- I'll never do it again... I promise!

Satan- Good.... Okay, I'll deal. Everyone ante up.

 (They toss in their ante)

Satan- Wait a second Hitler.... what the hell is this.... a pfennig? What 

        use is god-damn German currency gonna do down here?

Hitler- Ich bin saver.

 (Hitler takes back his pfennig, and throws in something else.)

Hitler- Da.

Satan- Good; Okay Death, cut the deck, and don't you even think about pulling

        that stupid scythe gag. Its just not funny the fifth time!

Death- (Chuckling to himself) Oh.... I love that.
