                        By: Muthergoose

        I just couldn't decide who to put my money on. It was the night of

the big fight between Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny. The seats were 

packed and the odor of cigar smoke hung in the air. Everyone was yelling back

and forth to each other, waving fistfulls of that great green stuff, money.

As the house lights dimmed, I hastily put a thousand down on the Easter 

Bunny. The bookie wrote it down and told me where to meet him, after the

fight.
        
        The loudspeakers crackled and buzzed, sending out some piercing feed-

back.
        "Ladies and gentlemen," the announcer began, "Tonight, the main 

event! In this corner, we have, weighing in at 285 pounds, SANTA CLAUSE! And

in this corner, weighing in at 7 pounds and 4 ounces, THE EASTER BUNNY!"

        Santa stood up and began to jump from foot to foot, warming himself

up. His elves pulled back his red satin robe. He shook his head from side to

side and punched his gloves together.

        In the opposite corner, the Easter Bunny, who had been hopping the

whole time, signaled that he was all set to go.

        "Lets keep it clean," the announcer muttered.

        The hammer hit the bell. At the sound of the ding, the two fighters

jumped into the middle of the ring. They began dancing around each other,

testing their strengths and weaknesses. Before anyone knew it, round one was

over. The fighters returned to their respective corners. Not a single punch

had been thrown.

        The crowd was expressing their boredom, through the occasional "boo",

and calls of encouragement such as:

        "Beat that big elf into the ground!" Or:

        "Show Mr. Cadberry who's boss!"

        This kind of motivation seemed to revitalize the fighters. Midway

through round two, Santa leaped into the offensive, and the Easter Bunny

began taking a serious bruising. At the end of round two, things weren't 

looking good for the rabbit. The Easter Bunny's doctor was advising him not

to go on with the fight. Easter Bunny spat some blood onto the ground and

stepped into round three with even more grim determination.

        Santa came in swinging. His body dodged around with cat-like move-

ments, but there was nothing the big man could do to escape the blood thirsty

rabbit.

        Santa leaned back and let out a hearty:

        "Ho Ho Haghkkkk----"

        The Easter bunny was at his throat. Four hard jabs to the face and

the jolly fat man went down.

        T'was the night before christmas and all through the world, not a 

creature was stirring, not even Santa Clause.

        Like I care! I got me a cool 3 grand. Some christmas wishes do come

true. Thanks Santa!
