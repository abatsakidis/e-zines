    Let me start off by saying, "There is always a margin of error and if you
are actively doing something, the percentage of being caught increases EVERY
DAY!"
    In other wordz boyz and girlz, I'm trying to say, "Keep your fucking nose 
clean and if you are under suspicion by the Feds then lay low for a while and
try to hide out with one of your buddies."
   

    Stealing from stores is the stupidest thing you can do because: one, the 
shop has security camera's and two, there is nothing of true value that you 
can steal without getting caught. I mean, what the hell are you gonna steal at
Radio Shack or Circuit City? Are you gonna try to put a 21" screen TV in your
jacket and casually walk out of the store? If you do this and get away with it
you deserve a presidential commodation. "So", you say, "What the hell can I 
steal from?"  Well here's the answer.  You steal from Tractor Trailer trucks.
"Where can I find them?" you say. Well they are commonly found at motels, fast
food restraunts, and gas stations. 
    Let me remind you that most truck drivers sleep during the day and drive
all night because there is almost no traffic at late hours. So all you have to
do is get a crow bar or a sledge hammer and find a tractor trailer. I would not
suggest that you follow one on the beltway because you may find yourself in 
Ontario, Canada by the time the driver makes a gas stop and you'll feel real 
stupid because you're in the middle of faggotville and don't know how to get 
home. When you find the trailer, take your impliment of destruction and go to 
the rear of the trailer. Look at those big doors, notice that there is a bar
the outlines the space between both doors. Take you crow bar and place it under
the bar and try to pop that big bar off or you can always break the lock with 
it. If you brought a sledge hammer with you then you will have an easier time 
cause all you gotta do is smash at the lock on that big old door. Once you 
smashed it look around to make sure no one is watching <witnesses SUCK!> and 
open the door. You can find lots of great stuff like fruit, furniture, Phone
equipment, or even electronix! I found my CPU in one of them! Grab something 
quick, make sure it's not too big but not too small because remember, 
"Whatever you take, you gotta carry back to your car!" 
    If you still insist on stealing from a store, then you must pick a store
to steal from and what equipment you want to steal <best if it's a window 
display item>. Visit the store at least one week before you plan to steal 
from it so you can figure out escape routes just in case something goes wrong. 
Also take note of ALL mirrors and ALL ceiling tiles that look akward because 
chances are high that they will be concealing a camera. Go home and make maps 
of possible escape routes. When the time comes for you to do the robbery <At 
Night time>, eat oranges becuase it will remove alot of you skins oil so the 
police won't get prints. Also find a good pair of gloves <Gortex, Leather 
gloves, or anything that covers you finger tips>. Put the gloves on and put on 
a ski mask <use panty hose if you want to get caught>. Then walk <don't drive 
cause people can get license plates and also what the hell would the police 
think if they saw a man with a ski mask on driving down the road at night 
time?> to the store you plan to rob. Break the windows and enter through there
or pick the locks. If you broke the windows you have about 2-5 minutes to grab
what you need and get the fuck outta there! If you picked the lock then pull 
out a cig. and puff away. Don't drop the cig cause it will be evidence. Look
for any colored lights and those will be the fucking motion detectors. If your
cig is producing heavy smoke then you are royaly screwed cause it will set off
either the fire alarm or the motion detectors. Remeber that it's not wise to
spend your time in a shop you break into for more than 5 minutes. Also NEVER, 
NEVER use a flashlight because there are security guards around and they will
inspect any thing because they are bored outta their minds. I learned the hard
way. I used my flashlight to steal some memory for my CPU that I stole from a
truck, and this Security guard tried to catch me but alas, I had a crow bar and
he only had a flashlight. I swung the crow bar at his knees and he went down 
fast. Using a weapon against someone doesn't prove anything but that the person
you attacked was a threat to you or you're just a fucking wimp. 
    If you are being followed by security guards, run for a wooded area and 
run for a housing developement that you are very familiar with. Hide out under
someone's deck that is out of plain view. If you are being followed in the mall
then you may want to remove a tile from the ceiling in the bathroom <if you 
have time to do so> and climb up through the crack. Make sure you put the tile
back in place and proceed to crawl towards a vent system. I had to do this 
during the day once because I swiped a CD and was nearly caught. Luckily I got
up there really quick. I could see light coming from a tile off to my left. It 
ended up that there was a hole in one of the tiles above the womens bathroom 
so I crawled to it and hung around for about 2 hours. when the 2 hours was up
I figured the security guards were gone so I opened the tile a bit to make sure
no one was in the bathroom before I climbed down. No one in there, but the tile
was cracking and I fell through the tile on to the ground. I opened the window
in the bathroom and jumped out. I'm still not sure if it was worth it. But as
I think about it now I realize that those events gave me experience and have
helped me get many additions for my Computer!
