                             ------------

                          Author's Foreword:

        My name is Count Buttocks. I would like to say a few things before
you begin your descent into the surrealisitic, virtual world of ideas that
is "DARK PENGUIN". In the writing of this poem... my personal masterpiece... 
I tried for a grand epic feel. Something parallel to Odysseus... My inspir-
ation for the poem cam to me through a re-occurring nightmare of Omar Sharif
in his underwear, uttering the word 'DOMINOES' over and over again. I have
also written it in my own style. I like to call it... crap-verse.
        I have a purpose in this poem. My purpose is quite hidden. I 
challenge you, the reader to decipher it. It is the challenge of this poem.
You must try and find the purpose or meaning of this poem.
        I also have a suggestion. This particular poem is better heard and 
not read... and also... it is best  if you have it read to you by a burly
clown, or a dentist who really likes "Heaven's Gate".
        Remember..... you must attempt to figure out the point of the poem...
the purpose. And in doing so... maybe discover your OWN purpose, on this re-
volving sphere we like to call- The Earth.

                             ------------
To live... to die... to bungee...
Eat, sleep, pray, sweep...
I am all in time.
Heaven..., Hell...,
Both not unlike Cleveland.
Death, Life...
The soul and spirit can seperate from the flesh...
Escaping the body...
Mine did once,
And ran up a helluva tab at Sears.
Spaghetti, Jello, Spirit...
VERSIONS OF THE SAME THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Infinity only exists in space and
In the human mind.
With the possible exception of Earnest Borgnine.
How inspiring is the immortal PHILOSOPHY.
The Great Socrates...
Whose final words were...
"Wait just a god-damn second...
This isn't a Long-Island ice tea?!"
There is no God...
A thought crosses my mind,
Every time I catch a syndicated episode of Full House.
Forever IS limited...
Death has died...
The Scythe falls into new hands,
Hands without discretion...
Let us pray they used lotion???!!!
How boring is existance
Man IS truly bored.... waiting
I myself am waiting...
Waiting eternal
My waiting becomes boredom...
My boredom becomes agony...
My agony somehow becomes polyester...
God created man
Man, in turn, destroed God,
Only then to create "Shake'n'Bake"
Which you can buy for a really great price at your local Seara Roebuck
And company Department store.
How meaningless is life........
Although I bet it has more meaning than
This Hippopotamus crap of a poem.
Love, life... DEATH!
All caribou lacerations are illegal,
In certain parts of Detroit...
The love of my Uncle Phil....
Who passed on before achieving his life's goal...
Of winning the Nobel Prize in Science...
For the invention of artificial tonsils.
Love, life... DEATH!
Wait..... I already used that love, life, death thing didn't I?????
Oh well.............
Me
You Everlasting
Look at this orange.
It came from that ora.............Oh, who gives a shit!
There is nothing to fear
But fear itself....
With the possible exception of a drunken teamster.

AND ALONE IN THE CORNER LIES..........
THE DARK PENGUIN..................................................
..................................................................

                             THE END
