1) WHAT IS A RED BOX AND WHAT DOES IT DO?

Simply put, a redbox is any kind device with the ability to reproduce tones
clearly enough for a pay phone to recognize them. The theory behind the red
box is quite simple; a pay phone relies on different tones to recognize the
monitary value of the coin deposited into the phone. The red box reproduces
these tones so money need not be inserted. This can save you a few buck on
those LD calls. The dollar, quarter, dime and nickel all have unique tones
as follows.


Canadian Tones:

Nickel    2200hz     0.06s on
Dime    2200hz     0.06s on, 0.06s off, twice repeating
Quarter    2200hz     33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating
Dollar    ????hz    ??ms on, ??ms off, ? times repeating

American Tones:

Nickel    1700hz/2200hz    66 ms on (1 beep).
Dime    1700hz/2200hz    66ms on, 66ms off, 66ms on (2 beeps).
Quarter    1700hz/2200hz    33ms on, 33ms off repeated 5 times.



2) SO, HOW DO I MAKE A RED BOX?

Making a red box isn't too difficult. You can use pretty much anything that
records audio. Here are some possible options:

    - Mini Disc Player
    - Burned CD
    - Modified Tone Dialer
    - any other digital recording device.



3) OK COOL, NOW WHERE CAN I FIND/MAKE THE TONES?

Well, luckily they can be found online at:

http://www.phonelosers.org/red_box.html


This page also gives much more helpful information on redboxing for those who
are interested.

You could probabaly make the tones with some kind of sound editor as well, but
why bother when you can download them?



4) HOW DO I USE MY RED BOX?

All you have to do is play the tones into the handset while making a long
distance call. You could use it on a local call but you would have to press "0"
to reach the operator first and then play the tones to him/her.



5) WHICH PHONES ARE BEST FOR THE PURPOSES OF RED BOXING?

Well, the easiest phones to abuse are the dumb phones such as the "Nortel
Centurion" for those of you east of the Rockies. Or the "GTE Automatic Electric
120" for those of us who are in the great province of British Columbia. Even so,
you may not have your way with every phone, some or most of them have security
measures installed such as resistors which muffle tones of the pitch we are using
going into the handset. Thanks to the boys over at www.hackcanada.com, everyone
who has the time and the balls to disassemble a Nortel Millennium handset and mod
it a bit can red box a Millennium. Go to Hackcanada to learn how. Never bother try-
ing to Red box a COCOT such as an Elcotel, Protel* or Intellicall. The basic rule of
thumb here in Canada is, go for the Telco eqipment.

    * -     Note: I believe Telus owned Protels can be red boxed since they act
        like dumb phones.


6)PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE:

The red box used to be one of, if not the most popular method of screwing the telco out
of not-so-hard earned dollars in the early 90's. However these days what with security
measures, more technologically advanced phones and the slow death of coin paid long
distance, the once bright light known as red boxing is fading into the darkness. As far
as coin paid long distance goes, it is still alive and well in Canada however our United
States counterparts are not so lucky. Verizon denotes the avaliability of coin paid LD by
a yellow handset so it is not avaliable on all of their pay telephones. Also, AT&T, the
once monopolisitic giant of the telephone service provider industry has phased out ATCS
coin paid long distance services which formerly used to serve many large American phone
companies such as QWEST and Verizon. And with the ever increasing cell phone population,
this trend can only continue until coin paid long distance is a thing for the history books.



7) END NOTES:

Does anyone know what the tone specs are for the one dollar coin in Canada? If so
please let me know. Thanks.



8) SHOUTS:

West Coast Phreakers, El Jefe, Strom Carlson and the guys at Hack Canada for
being a continuing source of information and inspiration.

MINERALIA CENTRE, PRETORIA,
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA.

ATTENTION; Sir/Madam,


I decided to write you even though we not are personally acquainted
which is largely due to time factor and the recent directive from
the presidency that all outstanding contractual obligations and
all contracts duly completed be settled before the end of this
quarter and the tension this has generated here.

Within the last 3yrs my two colleagues and I in my ministry
incharge of contract procurement and payment over-invoiced
contracts to the sum $30m and the fund is now ready for
payment into any foreign account - the original contractors have
been paid.  All we need from you to successfully transfer the
fund is to sign the contract / transfer documents with the
contract award committee which signing activates the release of
the funds from our ministry's foreign account with worldwide
securites in the Europe into your account.  We as civil
servants are not allowed by law to operate foreign bank accounts
nor make claims as contractors!

If you agree to assist us, we have resolved to allocate 35percent
to you while the remaining will be for us here bearing in mind
that we are three.  I must at this juncture let you know that this
transaction is one hundred percent safe, risk free and legitimate
as long as you do not tell anybody about it.  Invariably, we
require strict confidentiality having perfected all documents for
a successful transfer.  Infact, we have documents to show that
your friends here in South Africa helped you to procure the contract,
funded and executed it on your behalf.

Due to time constraints and security purposes, you must reply
this email as soon as you can, furnishing me with your phone and
Fax numbers for easy access.  Please feel free to ask any
questions as I am ready to explain any aspect you do not
understand.

Yours Faithfully,

COLLINS XOLA
