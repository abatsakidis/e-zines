+++ Into the Underground ++++ lowtec ++++++
===========================================

	Well here it is, the first issue of DIG!  I founded this magazine 
because I see lots of people working on interesting projects with 
unfocused efforts and no central place to report their findings, or ask 
for help.  I want this magazine to be an interactive experience for 
everyone who chooses to participate.

	While DIG will focus mainly on hacking, phreaking and exploring 
technology, I would love to see more diverse articles.  In the end our 
readers and contributors will have the biggest say in the direction we 
take this production by influencing us with letters, and by submitting 
articles to be published.  To some of the people who have been on the 
scene for a while, some of the information may seem to repeat ideas a 
little, but keep in mind that we are trying to appeal to a larger 
audience.  I think that this will be a good place to learn for everyone.

	Let me take a quick moment to dispel some common beliefs held by 
the unaware or ignorant.  Hackers are people too.  The term hacker as 
it is used here to describe someone who is aware and curious about how 
things work originated at the MIT artificial intelligence labs and was 
an honorable title.  The media and others have distorted the term to 
describe criminals.  The truth is that knowledge is power, and with 
power comes responsibility.  With that out of the way, please enjoy 
this issue, and use all information responsibly.

++ Explorations in Connected Technologies ++ Astral ++
======================================================

	In today’s connected world, it is impossible to picture the depth 
and complexity that our society’s 	infrastructure has grown to.  It’s 
amazing to know that at any one moment in time, there are thousands if 
not millions of transactions, connections and bits of data flowing all 
over the world at the same time.  Here I will explain and delve as far 
as I dare, into the beginning of the net and just how complex it truly 
is.

ARPAnet -- WTF IS THAT?
	ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was designed 
in the early 60's to be a mode of communication that could survive a 
nuclear war.  DARPA (a branch of the DoD) provided the main funding and 
research for the project.  It started out small, with only a few nodes, 
running on old DEC machines, commodores, and old CRAYS.  The main method 
of communication was over a land link phone line. It was like dialup for 
machines to talk per se.  After time, a lot of universities started to 
get connected with ARPAnet and researchers immediately saw its potential 
as a research network for collaborated efforts.  Then as more people and 
companies started to join the network, other countries started to get on 
the bandwagon, and create their own networks.  In the USA, there were 
several companies that offered public connections to the ARPAnet; they 
were Tymnet, Telenet (now Sprintnet) and some others.  MILnet was also 
on this, but at this time, was on its own nodes and PADs (packet 
assemblers / dissemblers).  The amount of connectivity at this point 
was also amazing; machines over great distances were connected and 
sharing data over their 300 baud modems.  The net was growing.

Old Articles -- A window into the true times of hacking and exploration
	One can get a glimpse into a time long forgotten, when exploits 
were still just an idea in Aleph One's mind, and when password guessing 
was trivial.  Back then finding a VAX/VMS was everyday and security was 
just as renowned on those systems as it is still today; hacking into 
NASA and Pentagon databases was very easy.  A lot of the old articles 
are still distributed and a good collection can be located at 
textfiles.com/hacking and these will just give you an idea of what the 
possibilities were.  Exploration was at its peak, the US Government 
actually declared war on the Texas based hacker group LoD (legions of 
doom) in Operation Sun Devil.  One can truly begin to understand what 
it took to be a hacker in those days -- intelligence.  You can see the 
depths of net connectivity even in these files.  There is even a LoD 
crash course in TCP/IP, something that had just come out during the 
80's and 90's.  We take for granted the 'ping' command, these guys had 
to try and explain it to hackers who were used to dialup PADs and 
IBM / VAX / UNIX System V OS's.  By reading these articles, you will 
become aware of a time before you may have even been curious about 
computers and the world; it’s also a good history lesson of our roots.

Net Complexity -- The massive infrastructure we call the net.
	The internet is built and supported by many massive companies.  
With current statistics saying over 4 billion websites / pages, the 
internet is only growing in size.  The net is very complex and 
incorporates many different technologies for sharing information.  Once, 
a couple of years ago, I stumbled upon a Linux machine with an 
interesting login banner.  It gave me a guest account and after reading 
everything, it turns out this was a radio link machine to service backup 
medical emergency radio frequencies for all of south Texas.  It was part 
of a huge radio relay network.  To think that my packets on the BBS were 
being transmitted across Texas at around 300 Baud on the Ham 2m bands 
and such to other BBS's and transceivers and then over a few ham 
satellites was just amazing to me.  Another example of depth is the 
ARPAnet; it’s still there!  I play on it all the time, it is very slow, 
and sometimes has a few network outages in certain areas.  Still, for 
its age and effective yet immature design, ARPAnet is still functioning.  
A lot of companies are moving back onto it, due to the security, such as 
ANI and phone logs as you remember a good bit is over the x.25 protocols 
and modem out dials.  You cannot form an exploit and send it to your 
target on this network.  The internet also links to it; I have found TCP 
gateways onto the old ARPAnet for routing and database connectivity 
purposes.  I love the feeling of making old DEC machines turn their tape 
drives and run their modem PAD switches somewhere in a basement, covered 
in dust.  In most places like South America and parts of Asia and 
Russia, the ARPAnet is still a major thing to them.  There are whole 
sections still linking banks, governments, and companies back to the net 
and to each other.  Their networks are still active and for the most 
part, largely unexplored.  Even in the old files, very few did exploring 
in world-wide networks.  Most dealt with the UK, or Germany, but those 
were also leading net countries along with the USA.  The machines are 
still working hard probably covered in cobwebs and dust, as the large 
magnetic tape drives spin daily, keeping track on their 25 MHz 
processors what our GHz servers do today.  They run the governments, the 
banks, and keep their country connected permanently.  In Mexico I saw 
some of the old server buildings and such belonging to TelMex when I was 
in Cozumel.  I yearned to go exploring into their depths to find old 
gems, but my concern to keep my freedom and to avoid Mexican prison for 
my unauthorized exploring kept me from doing so.

Conclusion -- Did you understand?
	In the end, it’s the drive, that maddening sense to explore the 
old networks, to see its true depth that urged me to write this.  I hope 
I have inspired some of you to start reading and learning the ways of 
the old hackers; the true Columbus’s and Vikings before our time.  Read 
them, explore, and picture the massive amounts of information on the 
web, wireless, radio, ARPAnet, and SATnet that traverse the globe 
constantly.  You will be amazed and I promise, almost overwhelmed.  The 
true underground awaits you.  Go forth, explore, and conquer.

++ An Analysis of Smartcards ++ lowtec ++
=========================================

	Smartcards are becoming ever-more popular in today’s world.  When 
people are looking for security in their applications and they are not 
willing (or able) to put lots of resources towards ensuring that the 
security is effective, they turn to someone who is willing to do the job 
for them.  Smartcards offer a very cheap and (potentially) secure 
solution.  Some of the examples of smartcards in use today are:  phone 
cards (mainly in Europe), pay TV services (DSS, Direct TV), GSM phones, 
an increasing number of credit card companies are combining smartcards 
with regular magnetic stripe cards, they can be used as an access 
control device, several banks in Europe are using them to authenticate 
users, and they can be used as a stored value card or e-purse.

	alt.technology.smartcards has an excellent FAQ on smartcards which 
is available at http://www.scdk.com/atsfaq.htm.  Although the FAQ will 
go into much more depth than this file, I intend to only give an 
overview of smartcards and focus mainly on the security issues.

	Before going any further, it should be made clear that there are 
two types of smartcards, only one of which is truly ‘smart’.  Memory 
cards that simply store information and have no onboard processor are 
not truly smartcards but are occasionally grouped in the same category.  
True smartcards are basically computers on a small chip without a power 
supply; they have memory storage and a processor.

	The idea behind smartcards has good intentions, but the truth is 
that from a security standpoint, some implementations of smartcards are 
unreasonable.  In some applications the end user has in their possession 
the card which contains the chip with the secret information, they can 
assault the card indefinitely and have no fear of being caught by 
authorities, or arousing suspicion from invalid attempts.  The whole 
idea with smartcards is that the single card is secure enough to 
authenticate a user, so that a central server does not need to be 
accessed, however this is not to say that it is never accessed.  Also a 
record of transactions can be kept, but there is no way to distinguish a 
valid transaction with an illegitimate one.  Times when a smartcard is 
not a good idea to use as a security control device are when the actual 
card is the only record or holder of the transaction or authentication 
information.  Cases that stand out as bad ideas for use with smartcards 
include:  phone cards, pay TV, and as an e-purse.  In other cases, 
smartcards may add a degree of security; however the network carrying 
the smartcard data should also come into consideration.
 
	Smartcards are described under the ISO 7816 standard which defines 
everything from physical and electrical characteristics of integrated 
circuit cards down to communication to and from the card.  It should be 
noted that there were cards made before 1990 that had a different 
standard contact location and therefore can not be used with ISO 7816-2 
compliant smart card readers.  Although contact location and function is 
now standardized, the design of the contacts is not.  Most contact 
designs are patented and make it easy to distinguish a manufacturer’s 
cards.

	Unlike magnetic stripe cards that can be easily read and written 
to by anyone with the money to buy an encoder, or the know how to build 
one (that’s another file); smartcards restrict read and write 
operations.  There are varying levels of protections that can be 
implemented in smartcards because essentially a smartcard is a computer 
without a power supply.  However, smartcards are limited to either being 
read or written to simultaneously.  This was done to slow down attacks 
on the card.  The nice thing about smartcards is that in order to read 
or write to them, no special equipment is needed; only an interface to a 
computer which could consist of contacts and a power supply, or the 
power could be provided by the computer.  If you are planning on 
obtaining a smartcard programmer, I would suggest (for the technically 
inclined) building your own.  It is not a terribly complicated project, 
but not recommended as a beginning project.  There are several sites 
that provide schematics for building smartcard programmers.  Note that a 
reader is the same as a programmer, i.e. it can read and write data to a 
smartcard because there is no special hardware involved.

	What happens during a typical smartcard transaction:  1) After the 
smartcard is inserted into the reader, the reader generates a random 
number which is sent to the card.  2) The card is asked to perform a 
secret calculation with the random number, which the reader also 
performs.  3) The card sends the result back to the reader, which 
compares the numbers.  If there is a match, the card is authenticated 
and the transaction is allowed to proceed.  This authentication 
procedure is commonly known as a challenge response.

	While one may think that simply by analyzing the data between the 
card and the reader, all cards could be compromised.  Such a 'replay' 
attack could be beneficial to understanding what goes on during a 
session.  Although a capture of the data between the reader and card may 
be encrypted, no doubt it will help in analyzing the card.  Protection 
against replay attacks includes using a digital signature and a counter 
on the card to refuse replayed transactions.

	Until this point, smartcards seem fairly secure and difficult to 
attack.  A flaw in smartcards was found by Paul Kocher of 
http://www.cryptography.com that allows for the extraction of the secret 
key.  The flaw was that by analyzing the power consumption of the 
smartcard you would be able to determine the secret key from the spikes 
in power (high for 1, low for 0).  This attack is known as Differential 
Power Analysis (DPA), which at the time of its discovery all smartcards 
were vulnerable to this attack.  However a solution to prevent or thwart 
DPA was put forward, that is by running a random number generator on the 
card separate from the meaningful processing, an attacker trying to 
extract the key would be foiled.  It is not known how widely the 
solution has been implemented.

	In order to carry out DPA an attacker would need an oscilloscope 
capable of sampling at a rate equal to or higher than the card's 
transaction and highly technical knowledge.

	DPA is not the only attack that can be used against smartcards.  
By physically opening the card and modifying the fuses inside (after 
dissolving the protective black epoxy on the EPROM) with microprobes it 
is possible in some cases to gain access to secret parts of the card, or 
bypass certain 'features'.  Also there are many other timing attacks 
possible by applying much higher or lower voltage than usual to the 
card.  By altering voltage levels, the card’s processor clock may speed 
up or slow down significantly, allowing an attacker to learn more about 
each clock cycle.

	A similar attack to DPA which was recently brought to my attention 
could use thermal imaging to observe very small changes in temperature 
on different areas of the chip, and if a random number generator was 
implemented separately from the main processor, it could be isolated.  
By correlating the changes in temperature to processing cycles, like DPA 
the secret key could be extracted.

	It should be noted that chip manufactures should not want to lock 
down their chips from all analysis; they want to be able to examine 
chips that fail to determine the cause of malfunction.  Invasive attacks 
can be made easier by the fact that silicon is transparent to infrared 
light.

	In the case of Pay TV, pirates have been able to write protect 
their access card and only use the decrypting functions on the card by 
the use of an emulator and a legitimate card.  Pay TV companies 
retaliate by adapting their signal to try to cut off pirates, and a cat 
and mouse game ensues.  Some more advanced pirates have figured ways to 
bypass the need for updating scripts on their cards by modifying the 
receiver unit, this only goes to show that more than just the smartcard 
must be considered in application.  Many satellite TV hacking web sites 
have cropped up as a result of its popularity, and while some have 
valuable information, most have little information of interest to the 
smartcard hacker.

	Smartcards are very interesting pieces of technology that you can 
count on seeing more of in the future.  In the near future smartcards 
could replace identification cards and records could be stored right on 
the card.  There are definitely privacy issues at hand with smartcards 
and related technologies.  Unfortunately Microsoft and other 
corporations see the use of cryptographic hardware as a means of 
controlling what applications can be run on their hardware.  The Xbox 
only runs Microsoft – signed code (without a modchip or a buffer 
overflow exploit from a legitimate piece of code).  Microsoft’s current 
project (which deserves its own article), Trusted Computing Platform 
Alliance (TCPA), Palladium, or “Next Generation Secure Computing Base” 
(NGSCB) as they are calling it now (due to negative publicity) will use 
the same type of technology to control what programs you can run on your 
computer.  As technology advances and chips become even smaller, 
attacking hardware invasively becomes harder.  Also, manufactures will 
become devious and integrate the cryptographic chips right into their 
processors of your computer making any attacks very difficult to carry 
out.

===================================================
+++ Thoughts on EZ Pass / Speed Pass +++ lowtec +++
===================================================

	Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a relatively new and 
largely unexplored technology.  RFID technology is already in 
widespread use, some examples are: Exxon speedpass, EZPass for tollways, 
wireless smartcards and other wireless cards, secure car ignitions, and 
less common 'smart shelves'.

How does it work ?
	RFID operates in a number of unlicensed frequency bands worldwide, 
with 125 KHz and 13.56 MHz the most common. The 13.56-MHz tags hold as 
much as 2,000 bits of data, or roughly 30 times the information of 
125-KHz tags.  Low-frequency (30 KHz to 500 KHz) systems have short 
reading ranges and lower system costs. They are most commonly used in 
security access, asset tracking, and animal identification applications. 
High-frequency (850 MHz to 950 MHz and 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz) systems, 
offering long read ranges (greater than 90 feet) and high reading 
speeds, are used for such applications as railroad car tracking and 
automated toll collection. However, the higher performance of 
high-frequency RFID systems incurs higher system costs.

	Short range, low-frequency tags are powered by a magnetic field 
when held up to the reader (It's basic physics - The tag contains a coil 
of wire which, when moved through a magnetic field generates an electric 
current).  The longer range, higher frequency tags usually contain 
batteries which usually last 3-5 years.  RFID tags are transponders; 
they recieve and transmit.

	Although the majority of RFID tags are write-once/read-only, 
others offer read/write capability and could, for example, allow origin 
and destination data embedded in a shipping container's tag to be 
rewritten if the container is rerouted. The data store on a 13.56-MHz 
tag is large enough to contain routing information for the shipping 
container and a detailed inventory of the products inside.

	As mentioned earlier, some stores have started using RFID tags on 
their products to track inventory and prevent theft.  These tags are 
supposed to be deactivated after a sale is completed, but may not always 
be.  If a tag was left in your clothes, it could be read by other 
readers and used to determine your identity.  If we're not careful we 
could have something very similar to the Minority Report going on.  As 
RFID tags get smaller and smaller they will be almost impossible to 
locate in something you have purchased.  Europe plans to embed RFID tags 
in every piece of paper currency by the year 2005.

	Many modern cars use RFID tags embedded in the key to determine if 
the car is being stolen.  If not present the car will not start.  RFID 
tags are susceptible to interference, and when in close proximity with a 
Mitsubishi SUV an Exxon speedpass would not let the vehicle start.  If a 
car owner wants to get a new key for their car, they must go to their 
dealer and buy the special key with the embedded RFID tag, and follow 
the directions in their manual for programming the key.  Usually the car 
will require two other valid keys in order to program a new key, 
otherwise your dealer will have to work his magic. 

Security
	In the Speedpass system a credit card is linked to your tag, but 
your credit card number is only referenced by an identifier on the tag, 
so no actual credit card numbers are processed on the system.  This is a 
good safeguard but it doesn't prevent lost or stolen tags from working 
as no PIN numbers are required for operation.  Typically if a tag is 
lost or stolen it must be reported to be deactivated.

	It is questionable whether or not an RFID transaction could be 
'sniffed' and replayed or whether a tag could be copied without opening 
it up to gain access to the memory.  If this is possible then leaving 
your EZPass glued to your windshield, where anyone could read your key 
might not be a good idea.  Depending on the implementation of the 
system, it may or may not be secure.

	This is a brief description of an Exxon speed pass transaction:  A 
gas-pump-based reader interrogates the key-fob SpeedPass (which contains 
a chip and an antenna) waved inches from the pump, obtains its 
identifier, passes that on via a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) 
network to a back-end system for credit approval and then turns on the 
pump, all in seconds.

	Read range is another concern with security, because systems are 
designed not to cause interference and ignore weak signals it is 
possible to build a sensitive reader which would amplify weak signals.

	RFID technology is another interesting technology, but it requires 
careful implementation in order for it to be secure and protect 
individuals’ privacy.

==========================================
+++ Explicit Anarchy +++ Dreg Nihilist +++
==========================================

	First and foremost, I want to evince the truth about the 
philosophy of anarchy that is often effaced by the corrupt 
misinterpretation imposed on this theory by the punk movement of the 
1980’s.  This movement has lead much of the public to believe anarchy is 
a philosophy that is based on allowing chaos to reign over crazed and 
frenzied antics of anti-government extremists.

	In all actuality, the idea is quite the contrary to the violent 
label with which anarchy has been so incorrectly deemed.  Anarchy is 
actually a very peaceful concept derived from two Greek words meaning 
“without government” and was once known as “Liberation Socialism”.  The 
idea is anti-government, but in the manner of speaking of how government 
restrains those living under it.  Anarchy is being able to liberate 
society from governmental restrictions through each individual 
cooperating to achieve a peaceful and enjoyable political environment 
that diminishes all necessity of an unwanted government.  It is not an 
attempt to violently overthrow power and order to be able to act on 
whatever whim crosses through one’s mind; it is a theory based on being 
magnanimous and mature enough to live harmoniously through compromise 
and toleration. An anarchic society does not need to be ruled over; it 
advocates thought and action that denies the ruling of people and 
eventually ownership of petty things like land and property that could 
cause confrontation.  It illustrates the belief that people are 
civilized enough to collaborate through open agreements to create a 
substitute for a mediator or intermediary; liaison would be the standard 
of living. William Godwin, the first proclaimed anarchist, wrote 
Political Justice in 1793 which proclaimed his idea and view of anarchy.  
Pierre Joseph Proudhon was Godwin’s successor in spreading the dogma of 
anarchic culture with his book What is Property? (which is how the 
denial of owning land or property was first introduced).  One Russian 
anarchist, Mikhail Bakunin, motivated Peter Kropotkin, another Russian 
anarchist, to write a multitude of books that significantly affected 
anarchy such as The Conquest of Bread, Mutual Aid, and Fields, 
Factories, and Workshops.  Kropotkin wrote the first adroit encyclopedia 
definition of anarchy that lasted a total of about fifteen pages.  Next, 
Leo Tolstoy introduced Christian anarchy and also wrote "The anarchists 
are right in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be 
worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions."  
Anarchy continued to grow and form and become more tangible, but this 
also opened the belief to persecution such as in cases of The Chicago 
Martyrs or the "Haymarket Eight".  Alexander Berkman, companion of one 
of the instrumental figures of the anarchist movement (Emma Goldman), 
wrote ABC of Anarchism which declares anarchism as freedom from 
enslavement.  Anarchy has evolved through many movements and is still 
practiced today in small communities and societies.

	Anarchy is not at all a manifestation of terrorism or disorder 
even though the government and media often give it a connotation 
synonymous with turmoil because they feel threatened by the idea.  Power 
corrupts; anarchy is the solution. Anarchism encompasses many ideas and 
theories or similar philosophies such as existential individualism, 
anarcho-syndicalism, class struggle, anti-speciesism, self-sufficiency, 
anti-racism, and eco-anarchism. Anarchy has become a widely accepted 
belief around the world and is openly supported.  Everything is subject 
to perception and interpretation, but misunderstanding the belief 
structure and concept base of anarchy is unfortunate.  Anarchy speaks 
for itself through its history and tenets. Anarchists can correctly 
demonstrate and convey the doctrine of anarchy through their actions, 
words, writings, and presentations of the practice of Anarchy.

+++ Stunning Snacks ++++ lowtec +++
===================================

	Vending machines are very interesting and can range from purely 
mechanical to modern computer controlled devices.  These machines that 
provide drinks, snacks, newspaper, cigarettes, copies and other services 
(you could consider an arcade game or a payphone a vending machine for 
providing services) have been the target of many attacks since their 
introduction into society.  While the main objective of most of these 
attacks is to obtain free goods, services, or money from the machines, 
there are many more interesting things to be discovered, such as debug 
menus and status reporting functions.  Here I’ll make a very brief 
summary of most of the security issues with vending machines that I have 
read about or seen.  Be warned that by trying any of these methods on a 
machine that is not yours, without permission will get you into trouble.  
I do not condone or approve of stealing from vending machines.

	First there is the use of slugs, or coins on a string.  I’m sure 
this worked at one time or another, but today’s machines are more 
advanced and coins must pass tests based on weight, shape and size; 
coins with a string attached to them won’t roll properly or pass through 
trap doors.  Creating a slug the same weight, shape, and size as a coin 
seems like a lot of work and doesn’t seem practical.  There are some 
foreign coins which are very similar to US currency which could be used, 
and I’m sure you could find a website that provides comparison charts 
(this, as following methods is probably covered under counterfeiting 
laws).  This method is possible but seems a little far fetched unless 
you have a collection of Indochina pennies or something.

	Then there is the similar dollar bill tape method which although 
it has been known to work, requires a strong dollar and the tape must be 
very near the trailing edge of the bill for new machines.  I have heard 
that you need a very long (and strong) piece of tape on new machines and 
they are quick to reject bills if the alignment is even slightly off.  
Scanners on the machine need to be able to recognize the bill so tape 
can not be covering any of the printing on the bill.  This method seems 
shoddy at best and you have to carry around your taped up dollar which 
would be very suspicious.

	Another method involves short circuiting the machine by squirting 
conductive fluid, usually salt water into the machine through any 
openings, usually the bill or change slot.  In unprotected machines, 
this would cause unpredictable results which might include spitting out 
a coke or whatever the machine is dispensing.  Also sensitive electronic 
components of the machine would probably be destroyed.  In new models 
this problem has been fixed by shielding all sensitive exposed contacts.  
Some people will try to tell you that this will make the machine spit 
out bills, and while I have not tried this, it seems impossible because 
the bills, like the change are stored in a box which only allows coins 
and cash to enter (unless the machine makes change in which case there 
is most likely a separate ‘bank’ of coins for making change).  The coin 
box on most vending machines has an extra level of security so that the 
coins are never exposed once inserted into the machine.  If you have 
ever seen a parking meter being emptied there is a metal case that is 
pulled out and must be inserted into the large collection safe and 
twisted in order for the coins to be collected.  The main reason for 
this extra level of security is to prevent theft by employees.  Using 
salt water is an easy method, but is becoming obsolete and is messy.

	An interesting method that I haven’t confirmed is manipulating 
bills by putting the Mylar strip from a five (or higher) dollar bill on 
a one dollar bill, using the one dollar bill in a machine and spending 
the five dollar bill at a register (most cashiers won’t check for the 
Mylar strips).  This has been rumored to work on some change machines 
seen in arcades.  Manipulating US currency like this is most certainly 
illegal and could get you in trouble with the Secret Service (yes, they 
handle counterfeiting, credit card fraud, and protect the president).  
Anyway, just using the strip for verifying the denomination of the bill 
seems like a weak security system, not to mention it would be difficult 
to get that little thing out and attach it to another bill (maybe use 
superglue?).

	Color photocopying, or possibly even a black and white copy of a 
bill could work on old machines; again I haven’t tested this because 
reproducing currency is illegal except when it is ridiculously out of 
scale and one sided.  However, as any counterfeiter will tell you, 
matching the paper used is the hardest obstacle to overcome when 
printing fake money.  Also, machines that use scanners to check for the 
Mylar strips will probably not be fooled by a copy.

	A less well known method of getting free games at arcades is to 
take any coin (usually a penny) and flicking it up through the change 
return slot.  I heard about this method from the temple of the screaming 
electron (http://www.totse.com), and while I can’t say that I understand 
why this would work, I haven’t had the chance to look inside an arcade 
game.  The article also suggested banging your knee into the coin box 
for free credits (ouch!).  I have tried flicking pennies up the change 
return slot with no luck, but I did notice that there are ‘bumps’ on the 
back of the change return area that probably were there to prevent me 
from doing just that.

	One more method I found while browsing through the temple of the 
screaming electron is cutting a piece of aluminum foil to the same size 
as a dollar bill and inserting it shiny side up.  The author says that 
this may cause the laser to be reflected onto the template the machine 
uses to compare any bill to.  I haven’t been able to test this, but I am 
doubtful that it will work because I think the scanner the machine uses 
counts on certain areas of the bill to be reflected (light and dark 
areas) and then compares those areas to its stored copy.  Also, what if 
the machine accepts $1 and $5 bills?  This is something to look into.

	You’ll notice all of these attacks are non invasive and require 
almost no special equipment to carry out.  It is trivial to break into 
one of these machines with the proper set of tools; that is not what is 
being addressed.  Also you’ll notice I’ve left out lock picking mainly 
because it requires special skills and tools, although when considering 
security it should not be overlooked.  Without a strong lock, a thief 
could easily saw through or chisel off a lock.  Each situation demands 
its own security analysis, for example snack machines could be tilted 
forward to dump all their snacks if they are not bolted to the wall.

	[I will say one quick thing about lock picking; some people have 
suggested getting some kind of quick drying clay and forcing it into the 
keyhole for a tubular key saying that this will give an impression of 
the key.  Whoever said this has no clue about how locks work.  The clay 
would get an impression of all 7 or 8 pins (depending on the lock); no 
information about the key could be obtained.  But, with the right tool 
(a tubular lock pick) tubular locks are very simple to pick.  But that 
is another article....]

	On to the very shocking exploit that gives this article its name.  
While most vending machine manufactures have at least taken some aspect 
of preventing fraud into their design, few have done much shielding of 
electrical contacts on the keypad, most are concentrated around the 
money collection areas, and even those have been fairly recent 
improvements.  I must give credit to Adrian Lamo for informing me of 
this exploit.  It is possible to use a normal self defense stun gun to 
cause some machines to make sporadic electrical connections which can 
yield unpredictable results, including the machine vending its product.  
The machines which are most notably vulnerable are the snack machines 
with the flush clear-button keypad.  Holding a stun gun up to the keypad 
firing it, and moving it around usually causes the machines to vend 
several snacks.  This exploit is probably not unique to only snack 
machines, but by manipulating voltage levels and using sparks to close 
gaps that control vending operations.  Similar results could probably be 
obtained by using other devices such as a HERF or EMP device.  This is a 
working exploit, at least on some machines, very easy to carry out, 
although it does require some special equipment and determination.  
However, stun guns are easily obtained through internet orders, or 
schematics can be found online.

	People have become extremely lazy with all of our great 
technology these days and they want to be able to know how what their 
vending machine is up to without having to go check the cash box.  
Computers in vending machines can dial up to the internet (or connect 
through a network) and email their owners all the information they 
could ever want (amount and type of product sold, product remaining, 
money in machine, usage statistics, etc).  Sometimes menus like these 
are available locally through a special combination of buttons, with a 
key, or with special hardware.  One widespread example is on most Coca 
Cola ® machines by imagining the button on top to be #1 and numbering 
down (or across on new machines) then press the buttons in order - 4, 2, 
3, 1, a menu system will come up on the 4 character display that allows 
you to view some information about the machine (credit to ch0pstikninja 
from the phonelosers.com forums).  Once you have accessed the menu 
system you can navigate through it using the buttons as follows 1 – 
previous menu, 2 – up, 3 – down, 4 - enter.  Now some people will say, 
“Ok, so how do I use that to get free cokes?” the answer is, you don’t.  
It’s just a neat little menu that was hidden from you before.  As one of 
the posters to the phone losers’ forum said, this could be useful to 
thieves deciding if a machine is worth breaking into.  Note that this 
should work on all machines made by Coca Cola ® (Fruitopia ©, Dasani ©, 
etc).  Similar menus can be found on many other machines with a quick 
Google™ search, a call to the manufacturer, or some smart finger hacking 
(try patterns, etc.).

	One particularly interesting feature present on some machines 
(usually at universities) is a card based accounting system.  Machines 
that use some sort of card access whether it is magnetic stripe cards, 
smart cards, or some other proprietary identification / accounting 
method can be very fun to play with.  Some people may be familiar with 
the Campus Wide system that Acidus and Virgil were prevented from giving 
a talk about at interz0ne.  These systems are almost always wide open, 
although they do require some technical knowledge to exploit.

	Playing with vending machines can be fun and occasionally 
rewarding, but be considerate to others and don’t damage the machines; 
leave them as you found them.  After you’re finished playing with a 
debug or admin menu, return the machine to normal mode.  Some machines 
will go back to normal mode after a minute or two but just be sure.  Use 
good judgment when exploring and have fun.

+++ The Conscience of a Hacker +++ The Mentor +++
=================================================

Written on January 8, 1986.

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager 
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank 
Tampering"...

Damn kids.  They're all alike.

But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever 
take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what 
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?

I am a hacker, enter my world...

Mine is a world that begins with school.  I'm smarter than most of the 
other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...

Damn underachiever. They're all alike.

I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain 
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, 
Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head."

Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.

Wait a second, this is cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a 
mistake, it's because I screwed it up.

Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks 
I'm a smart ass... Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...

Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

And then it happened.  A door opened to a world rushing through my phone 
line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent 
out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is 
found.

"This is it... this is where I belong."  I know everyone here... even if 
I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them 
again... I know you all.

Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike.

You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at 
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let 
slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by 
sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to 
teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in 
the desert.

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the 
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without 
paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering 
gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us 
criminals.  We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.

We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious 
bias... and you call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, you wage 
wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's 
for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is that 
of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.  
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never 
forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual, 
but you can't stop us all...

After all, we're all alike.

Whew! That was a lot of work, and I think this is a very solid first 
issue.  I'd like to thank all of those who submitted work (thanks to 
Strom Carlson for the cover!).  I would also like to thank those who 
inspired me to start this zine, mainly the now defunct Phone Punx Network 
(http://www.angelfire.com/nv/ocpp/main.html), and 2600 for leaving 
something to be desired in the area of hacking zines today.

I know we don't do shout outs, but if we did, I'd give a big shout out 
to:

the telco-inside crew (telco-inside.spunge.org)
teamphreak.net for putting out a cool zine (and linking to DIG!)
