Book Three : The beginning
==========================

In the beginning there was no b0rk
there were no drives
and there were no computers.

First the drugs
Then the guns came.
Then came the God of b0rk.

And he did b0rk.
Oh yes.
Indeed.

And he b0rked the PC.
And he b0rked the Disk Drive.
And he later b0rked the reinstallation of NT4.

As is the infinite wisdom of the God of B0rk.
