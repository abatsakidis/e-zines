Book Six : The Lore of B0rk
===========================

Noble and placid is the user
who in the name of charity and good will
writes anti-virus software
and attempts to usher the weak through
the ISP of AOL.

For they are truly their brother's keeper,
and the finder of lost file fragments.

But thou shalt know HIS name is the Lord,
when his virii rain down upon you.
