Book Twelve : The Mouse and the Graphics Card
=============================================

One is on your desk.
The other in your case.
One purrs with power and importance.
One sits silent and unheard.

But no matter which he strikes;
The mouse or the graphics card.

Your system will still be b0rked.

Such is the power of the God of B0rk.
