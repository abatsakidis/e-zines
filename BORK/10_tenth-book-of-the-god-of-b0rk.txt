Book Ten : Finality
===================

Everyday you take one step closer
to your ideal configuration

Everyday the God of B0rk takes you five steps back;
silently amongst your files

silently within your hardware
the god of b0rk is ever present.

will you notice him?
will he care?

your hardware will die,
your software will corrupt

you will never know he was there.

Perfection.
