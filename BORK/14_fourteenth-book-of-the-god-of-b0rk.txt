Book Fourteen : First Pope, Holy Father
=======================================

And from the Emerald Isle he will come
Aloft a Medium Sized Wing'ed badger
He shall spake the words;

"B0rk to the Discordian
 Principla! Be gone to
 the pit, to be sure, for
 I am the Holy Father of
 B0rk."

And the god of B0rk was impressed.

And our First Pope did take his seat.

And it was a very fine seat.

And Cronus was indeed happy.
