Book Fifteen : The End
======================

And when all the calculators,
All the processors,
All the mother boards,
All the floppy drives,
All the hard drives,
All the mice,
All the keyboards,
All the graphics cards,
All the sound cards,
All the CD-ROMS,
All the DVD-Combo Drives,
All the IDE cables,
All the PSU units,
All the USB controllers,
All the ISA ports,
All the AGP,
All the processor fans,
All the installations of BSD,
All the installations of windows,
And all the PCI slots are b0rked.

He shall rest.

Even the Random Windows Fearie will fade to nothing,

and there will be no more b0rk.

Just bored0m.
