Book Sixteen : The BSD Demon Is Evil
====================================

Another horror hides
Nay lurks in thou hard drive
Red in appearance
And geek like of code
BSD is here

Thou must learn to phear
And hideth the penguin of linus
For foul act
And sinful pleasure
The demon of BSD seeketh

The little red freaketh.
