Book Two : Thou shall lay to rest the b0rked 
============================================

Take the floppy drive between thou hands
Feel it's essence seep from it's now lifeless shell
know that the God of B0rk is a vengeful god

Lay the drive in the sand.

Utter the words.

"Praise be unto the God of B0rk
 May he protect us from the B0rked
 and the blight of being phased by the b0rked
 forever and ever
 The PSU and the IDE cable
 Amen."

And know that the b0rked have passed to the next world.
