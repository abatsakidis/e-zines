  Dark|||knight fell through on this issue (he was originally 
supposed to do it), but I am guessing this is because he's been
so busy or something.  Anyways, I couldn't get ahold of him and
Didn't know what I was going to do... but then came along Weapon
Dealer on irc, he had just released the first issue of his zine,
PLA215 and we got together and merged.  Now he is a member, and 
we took his first issue and edited it up, added a few more articles
and bam! we have DPP04! Enjoy it and then print it and use it to
hold up on leg of your couch.

WepnDlr. thats my name. you can find me at the address above or on 
irc efnet #pla. i know i sound lame, but listen up. i was born along 
time ago, and im like older now.... 14 yrs older.... i pissed on the 
carpet a couple times when i was young, and then things get blurry. i 
then remember my childhood in south philly, and them moving to the 
dullest place on earth (no, not ohio,) SouthWest PhiladelphiA!!!!!! 
It has a 9:10 COCOT ratio (9 out of 10 payphones are cocots.) Thats 
why i tell u- B0YC0T DA C0C0TS! Print this out an copy it at like a 
2 cent copy macine.:

Dear sir/madam:
	I would like to bring to your attention that the payphone you 
see here is a COCOT (customer owned, coin oporated telephone). These 
payphones do not give you correct change, they charge outrageous rates 
for long distance calls, and you cannot place a call to them, making 
paging pointless, and they sometimes dont let you make 1-800 number 
calls. I am asking you to please use the bell atlantic payphones. 
(you can tell the difference because of the groovy new artwork) Do 
everyone a favor. Boycot the COCOTs.

ok? do everyone a favor and spend like a dollar or somethin and like 
tape it to a cocot. jus do it.

                          The Wallet Story
                by Weapon Dealer (dmbarr@erols.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well, i like to say that i was at a cocot, postiong my usual 
"Boycot da Cocot" poster, when this pair of thug niggerz come up 
to me (im not racist) and start givin me shit. I tell 
them that they can use the payphone, and they rip off the sign.
I walk away, (crying.... boohoo) and manage to turn a 
corner so i can look at the wallet i stole from the shorter 
one's pocket. (he also took mine..... the thing is..... his had 
the 50$ bill in it an mine had my pla business cardz in it... 
hehehe!) it had this fake id and a library card. funny, how he looked 
like a 4th-grade droppout. so anyway, i keep looking, i find a calling 
card (expired..) and a blockbuster card. I goto the library and take out 
all the starwars books i could find. the librarian looked at me weird and 
said, "You dont look like what a person with the name Lakaet Tokwa 
would look like," but she let me take out the books anyway. I then went 
to the blockbuster and took out about 5 n64 games. "Do you plan to play 
them all?" the casheir asked. i told her i was gonna sell them to my 
friends for like 5$ and she told me to get out.... only after taking 
my purchase... so i went to the corner store and got change for the 50$ 
by buying a pack of gum. I took the trolley to the plaza and took out 
some more games. i went to pizza hut and had some pizza. thats when 
i realized that there was dope in the wallet! there was a small pack 
of marajuana seeds. i took them home and got on the net, and looked 
up how to grow pot. it said "Pot takes like a couple months to grow, 
and then it is a couple more until you can" blah blah blah and so i 
finally found where it tells you how to grow it and i got a couple 
of my moms gardening toolz and started the instructions. When i was 
finished, i had nuthin to do, and it was dark. I slept, and the night 
became day... It was Sunday!!!!! Time to do some redboxing! But thats 
another story.....

                          Cocot Price Raise
                  Weapon Dealer (dmbarr@erols.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

this is stupid.... i think it is unruly, uncanny, propostrous, 
ludicrous, and just all- out not good. mabell didnt HAVE to put 
all new groovy logos on their payphones. damn beurocratic sluts.... 
well, anyways, as far as i can see it, the price hike is to be a 
whole 10 cents- to make a local call cost 35 cents total. Ironically,
the cocots in my area also raised prices. i dont know why, maybe they
need to take advantage and get as much money as possible.

                   Cleaning out the telephone lines
                   Weapon Dealer (dmbarr@erols.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

On April fool's day a few years ago, I remember a radio announcement:
They announced that the phone company would be cleaning the dirt out of
the phone lines that afternoon.  To do this, it seems, they blew air 
into the wires in the switching station.  The problem is that the 
dirt was to come out of the ear piece and mouthpiece of the 
telephone, and could dirty the rugs or furniture in your house.  
Consequently, they said that the phone company asked that the good 
citizens please get plastic baggies and put them over the handsets 
of the telephones to protect their belongings.

Stores reported a run on plastic bags, and the phone company made the
radio station retract the original claim.

I've always felt that the retraction should have been handled this way: 
"The phone company would like us to tell you that our earlier message
concerning the blowing of dirt out of the phone lines was incorrect. 
The phone company does not, repeat NOT, blow into the telephone wires to
clean out the dirt.  Anybody with any understanding of the way the
system operates would know that they suck the dirt out."

Alas, the retraction was serious and factual.  What's this world coming
to anyway? 

                              Fun at shopko!
                  hatredonalog (hatredonalog@hotmail.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
We all go into that damn store.  So why can't we have fun there
then too?  Of course you all read rbcp's file on store's courtesy
phones.  This is well, um, a file on annoying the employees there
so you will never get bored again.  Needless to say this also
works at Wal*Mart, Target, KMart (hehe) and othe such stores.

I wuz inspired to write this article when I went to a local 
ShopKo to buy some twix and play on the phones.  I noticed
something.  There are very few employees running around 
saying "would you like any help?".  I thought it might be
fun to bother everyone there.  I looked around for cameras,
not like i really cared.  They were mostly all by electronics.

I got onto a phone and dialed the front desk.  i told them that
I was "Bob, the new guy", trying to sound as unbeleivable as i 
could.  i walked accross the isle to a different department 
where i can see still.  About two minutes later some worker
comes and looks around the phone.  

You know all those little "customer service" buttons everywhere?
they are usually opposite the phones on those posts in the
middle of the store.  Go around pressing all of them.  They
have to send someone to each one, because they don't know if it
is some kid playing on the thing or if it is someone in need of
dire help.  Run around pressing them repeatedly, and the
intercomm will be saying "customer service to wherever..." for
half an hour straight.  needless to say, it annoys the workers,
which leaves less workers to watch you.  Yes, this means you can
get away with more crap.  If you do this during the Xmas season
then the better it will be.  

The workers are now forced to run around answering customer
service calls.  DO NOT be in the dept. you are having the
workers go to.  They will yell at you and call you dumb.

Things to do while you have the employees running around:

o  Open up toys.  play with them. don't ruin them, well, if
   you really want to it's not my business...

o  Use your elite shoplifting skilz to get that dildo
   you wanted.

o  Play with anything you want.

o  Punch pinholes into 2 liter soda bottles (biiiiig mess)

o  Run around bothering customers.

o  Hax0r the dumbterms they have out for the workers to
   try to use.

o  Hax0r their display computers.  

o  Grab a cordless handset and run around yelling stuff into it 
   pretending that your security.

o  Go into the back area; find one of those vests that the 
   employees wear, and put on your name tag from work. you are
   now a proud employee of ShopKo! I have one that says "Lou".

o  Hang out in the break room for the employees. 

o  Place anywhere from 6-12 bombs throughout the building.

o  Take the store hostage

o  Rip the heads off all the stuffed animals

o  Let wild animals loose in the store!


Uhm, I hope you can see that I ran out of ideas near the end.

Thank you for reading another crappy article by me.  I hope
it like gives you a couple of more good things to do or
something.  Oh yeah, you like shouldn't do any of this stuff
or something because it is like wrong and stuff.  And even
if you do, it's not my fault or something.  Have fun!

 After attending a few Ham Radio classes, and watching a video on safety, a
rather interisting idea came into my mind.  Ham radios can transcieve on
several diffrent types of frequencys, HF (high freq.) VHF (very high freq.)
and best of all UHF (ultra high freq.) by transmitting at this high level,
you can emit 'microwave' radation (you know, like if you ran your mircowave
with the door open) Anyway, all you need to accomplish this, is a ham radio
that will transmit above 300mhz, and an amp to get it up around 1000watts.
Add a directional antenna or a dish, and blammo! instant death ray(sorta).

                                Area 51
            Unknown (donated by wepndlr (dmbarr@erols.com))
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


(INPUT 001)

The following it a transcript of parts of a speech presented by
Norio F. Hayakawa, director of the CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK,
at the 11th 'LOS ANGELES WHOLE LIFE EXPO' held at The Los Angeles
Airport Hilton Convention Center on November 16 and 17, 1991. 
The transcript from which we will quote is a revised and expanded
version of the address written on June of 1992 and titled:
'UFO'S, THE GRAND DECEPTION AND THE COMING NEW WORLD ORDER':

     "...AREA 51 is located in the northeastern corner of a vast,
desolate stretch of land known as the Nevada Test Site (a large
portion of which includes the Nellis Air Force Test Range) but
had practically nothing to do with underground nuclear testing. 
It is located approximately 125 miles north-northwest of Las
Vegas and consists of Groom Lake and the Papoose Lake Complexes. 
The presently expanding eastern portion of the latter complexes
is known as the S-4 site.
     "This entire area is under the strictest control of Airspace
R-4808N (with unlimited 'ceiling'), prohibiting any entry therein
of air traffic, civilian or military, unless special clearance
for such entry is secured well in advance.  By land, the area is
meticulously patrolled 24-hours a day by several tiers of
external security even through it is conveniently covered by
the... Jumbled Hills (that cover north of the Papoose Lake
area), making it virtually impossible for anyone to see the
facilities without first climbing atop the hills of the rugged
mountain range which became off-limits to the public since 1985.
     "The main external perimeter security is now being handled
by Wackenhut Special Securities Division, part of the operations
of Wackenhut Corporation, a worldwide semi-private security firm
based in Coral Gables, Florida which has an exclusive contract
with the U.S. Department of Energy and handles not only the
perimeter security at the Nevada Test Site but also at many other
secret facilities and sensitive installations throughout the U.S.
and U.S. interests worldwide, including ground-level perimeters
for several large underground facilities in and around Edwards
Air Force Base in Southern California.
     "It is also important to mention that dozens of unmanned,
miniature-sized remote-controlled automatic security vehicles
constantly patrol the immediate perimeters of the S-4 Site,
located around (and presently expanding particularly towards the
eastern portion of) Papoose Lake.  These automatic, miniature-
sized four-wheel vehicles have been produced by Sandia
Laboratories of Albuquerque, New Mexico exclusively for the
Department of Energy.
     "The outer northeastern perimeters of this area located in
the Tickaboo Valley come under the geographical jurisdiction of
Lincoln County and are relegated to the Bureau of Land Management
(B.L.M.).  Yet it is considered highly unadvisable for anyone to
even enter the main country dirt road, known as the Groom Road,
which begins its southwestern extension towards Groom Lake from a
point midway between mile marker 34 and 33 on Highway 375, and
leads to the guard shack located two and a half miles northeast
of the Groom Lake complexes.
     "The first line of exterior security forces (dressed in
military-type camouflage uniforms but with no insignia of any
kind whatsoever) consists of the GP patrols (the 'Groom Proper'
patrols, in Bronco-type four-wheel drive vehicles) who sometimes
drive around at night with their lights off on various country
dirt roads adjacent to the outer demilitarized zone, intimidating
any civilian vehicle that tries to enter those access roads (off
of Highway 375) located on public land.  The GP patrols
themselves (part of Wackenhut Special Securities Division),
however, are strictly ordered to avoid any direct contact with
civilians.  They are only instructed to radio the Lincoln County
Sheriff immediately should anyone be spotted driving on any of
those dirt roads.  The most common radio frequency used between
Security Control and Lincoln County Sheriff's patrols is 138.306
MHZ.
     "...The only area 'allowed' by the Sheriff for such
curiosity seekers to 'congregate' is an open area near a black
mailbox located at the south side of Highway 375 between mile
marker 29 and 30.  Even then, the Sheriff patrol will routinely
stop by during the evening to check on the cars parked at the
mailbox area.
     "Moreover, it is our understanding, based on information
provided by a highly reliable source connected to a special U.S.
Navy SEAL operations center, that the mailbox area is constantly
being monitored by high-powered, state-of-the-art, infra-red
telescopes set up at a facility known as Security Control high
atop Bald Mountain (10 miles west of the area), the highest peak
in the Groom Mountain Range.
     "...It was precisely at 4:45 a.m. on the morning of
Thursday, April 16, 1992, that an NBC news crew, dispatched to
the area to report on the landing of an alleged super spy-plane
known as Aurora on Groom Lake, accidentally succeeded in video-
taping the first flight (which we have been calling the 'Old
Faithful') of (a) mysterious object while standing at the mail-
box area and looking due south toward Jumbled Hills.  The
footage, taken with a night-scope vision camera, was broadcast
nationally on NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw on April 20, 1992.
The NBC News reported that it had video-taped a test flight of a
new U.S. aerial craft that had definitely defied the laws of
physics, and that the news team may thus have taken the first
glimpse of the other 'deep black' projects (aside from the Aurora
project) being conducted within the confines of the top-secret
facility.
     "Also in regards to the ongoing program, it is to be noted
that usually a day or two prior to significant test flights
(i.e., only if the test flight is a significant one, by whatever
measure known only to the installation) a vehicle-traffic counter
is laid on Highway 93, at approximately a mile and a half north
of Ash Springs, right before the juncture of Highway 375.  The
other counter is set up about a half mile or so west upon
entering Highway 375.  The obvious question is: in such desolate,
less-travelled areas of Nevada, why should there be such traffic
counters installed on undivided, lonely highways?  It is now my
belief that the number of cars being registered that head out
west on Highway 375 at such times (particularly in 'clusters',
such as caravans) is relayed to several of the security posts at
AREA 51, including the main observation post high atop the
previously mentioned Bald Mountain.  However, it is very possible
that they may now have more sophisticated devices for registering
the number of vehicles going through the area.
     "The February 21, 1990 expedition was instrumental in the
subsequent production of a two-hour documentary program entitled
'Saturday Super Special' televised throughout Japan on March 24,
1990 which was seen by more than 28 million viewers on prime
time.  The entire program dealt with AREA 51 and also the crew's
pursuit of an alleged biogenetics laboratory thought to be
located just outside of Dulce, a tiny town in northwestern New
Mexico, about 95 miles northwest of Los Alamos.
     "...The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory...seems to have a
Parapsychology Research Unit that coordinates its research
activities with DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency).  It is my understanding that some of their activities
conducted under the auspices of the Office of Naval Intelligence
are being held at locations such as AREA 51.
     "ELF (extremely low frequency) wave-emitting devices, scalar
machines, electromagnetic beam weapons and highly-defined
hologramic projections are just a few examples of the many new
types of mind-control 'weaponry' that the government seems to
have developed in the past three decades or so.  Newest
researches on special types of hallucinatory and memory-tampering
drugs are part of a growing 'arsenal' that the U.S. Naval
Intelligence boasts to have developed in its own Parapsychology-
Mind Control Unit.
     "According to recent information provided to me by a highly
reliable informant within a special operations group of the
Department of the Navy, two of the most widely used devices will
be R.H.I.C. (Radio Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control) and E.D.O.M.
(Electronic Dissolution of Memory).  The first of the two, Radio
Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control, calls for the implantation of a
very small, electronic, micro-radio receiver.  It acts as a
Stimulator which will stimulate a muscle or electronic brain
response.  This, in turn, can set off a 'Hypno-programmed' cue in
the victim or subject, which would illicit a pre-conditioned
behavior.  The second one, Electronic Dissolution of Memory,
calls for remotely-controlled production within the brain of
Acetyl-Choline which blocks transmission of nerve impulses in the
brain which results in a sort of Selective Amnesia.  According to
this source, in the hands of certain units within the
intelligence community both of these methods are ALREADY
BEGINNING TO BE USED!
     "An amazing article appeared in the Los Angeles Times on May
12, 1992 announcing that Caltech scientists have recently
discovered and confirmed the presence of 'tiny magnetic particles
in the brains of humans, similar to those that have heretofore
been found in other animals.' (L.A. TIMES, Section A, page 3). 
According to the Caltech researchers, it is now an undeniable
fact that every human brain contains a tiny natural magnetite
particle, even from the time of conception.  Could the
government, particularly the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, have
known this fact for a long time?  The answer definitely seems to
be in the affirmative! (Note: Perhaps the 'Philadelphia
Experiment', mentioned elsewhere in the COSCON files, had an
adverse affect on the 'electrochemical' or 'magnetite' particles
in the brains of the experimental subjects.  Could this explain
why so many of them allegedly went insane after the 'tests'? -
Branton)
     "It is interesting also to note that as of this writing,
many strange, turquoise-colored antenna-towers with triangular
configurations on top, are beginning to be constructed along key
areas near the freeway systems of many U.S. cities, particularly
proliferating the Los Angeles and Orange County areas of
California.  According to several reports, these antenna-towers
are presently being used as relay towers for the increasing
networks of cellular telephone systems (Note: Cellular phones are
very easy to tap-in to, and in some areas one can catch parts of
conversations by switching through the high 'channels' of the UHF
frequencies on television sets - Branton) and are being operated
by such firms as Pacific Bell and Telesis.
     "Yet the most interesting aspect of the constructions of
these strange antenna-towers is that there are increasing reports
that the Department of Defense is somehow involved in this
operation.  The frequency waves being utilized in the cellular
telephone communications are, according to several researchers,
strikingly close to the range of frequency waves used in several
ELF emission and microwave experiments of the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory as well as D.A.R.P.A., the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.  Will these towers be utilized throughout the
nation?
     "...In the meantime, government-sponsored genetics
researchers and bio-technology experts at New Mexico's Los Alamos
National Laboratory are said to be conducting in-depth studies
not only on the total effects of mind-control upon human
behavioral patterns but also on its possible applications
relative to such areas as genetics engineering and exploration of
the human genome.
     "A large underground genetics laboratory is thought to be
located just outside of Dulce, a tiny town in the midst of the
Jicarilla-Apache Indian Reservation located about 95 miles
northwest of Los Alamos and 100 miles east of sinister-sounding
Highway 666, the only stretch of highway in the U.S. with that
designation and the only highway that links the four states of
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.
     "Perhaps it may just be a pure 'coincidence' that this
highway, befittingly named Highway 666, which originated in
southeast Arizona and goes up north, cuts into northwestern New
Mexico, right near the Four Corners area--an area that happens to
have one of the most consistently concentrated UFO sighting
reports in the country since around 1947.  (Rumors even abound
that a mysterious craft of unknown origin had crash-landed in
1948 near Aztec, a small town located roughly midway between
Dulce and Highway 666.)  This entire Four Corners area,
especially northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado
(even extending, for that matter, to the entire southern tip of
the state) also has had some of the most concentrated reports of
unexplained cattle mutilations in the nation during the late
seventies and early eighties.  Was something covertly taking
place in those areas?
     "Even though we could not locate the alleged underground
genetics laboratory in Dulce when the Nippon Television crew and
I visited the area in late February of 1990, I had several
opportunities to interview scores of local residents there that
admitted that nightly appearances of mysterious lights
(occasionally accompanied by unmarked black helicopters)--darting
over, into and out of nearby Archuleta Mesa and Archuleta
Mountains--were quite common during the late seventies and early
eighties.
     "Many of them even claim to have spotted, on many occasions,
military-type trucks and jeeps as well as government vans passing
through Dulce and loitering around nearby mesas.  Occasionally
even black limousines carrying what appeared to be 'CIA' agent-
types were claimed to have been sighted 'loitering' around the
foothills of other nearby mesas.
     "We must bear in mind that the Dulce area is only 95 miles
northwest of Los Alamos.  Los Alamos National Laboratory is one
of the top U.S. research laboratories specializing in the study
of the human genome.  Also it is a vital center of the
government's SDI research and development programs.  Just about a
hundred miles southeast of Los Alamos is Albuquerque, New
Mexico's largest city, and more significantly, a city where
Kirtland Air Force Base is located right next to the sensitive
Manzano Storage Facility, a top-secret underground military
facility.  Sandia Corporation, one of the nations top-secret
government contractors specializing in top military-industrial
projects is also located in Albuquerque.
     "As far as advanced bio-technology is concerned, I have no
doubt that a micro-chip implantation technology is being
perfected in which tiny micro-chips could be implanted in our
circulatory systems, vital organs and tissues if need be for
whatever purpose the future may require.  It is my conclusion
that a large-scale research has been completed by the government
(with possible assistance from 'outside' sources) within the last
20 years or so utilizing tens of thousands of cattle in the
Southwest to conduct this covert experiment.  Only recently has
science proven that cow hemoglobin could be substituted (by
utilizing a special purification system) with human blood in
situations of 'unforseen national emergencies.'

Researcher David L. Dobbs of Cincinnati, OH., described the
following 'resume of report recieved... after the MUFON 40-meter
net on April, 5, 1980.':
     "...Mike (DELETED), Iowa (DELETED), stated that during the
period 1961-63 he performed radio maintenance at the atomic
proving ground.  He also did some top-secret radio work for the
Air Force at times.  The U-2 was developed here.  
     "'Area 51' was located 60 miles due east of the base camp,
behind a mountain range separating it from Yucca Flat.  Here a
secret operation was performed under unbelievable security
precautions known as 'Project Redlight.'  A UFO which had been
shipped from Edwards AFB was flown here.  It was not
conventionally powered, but was SILENT in operation.  Mike
assumed that this was the disc recovered intact and shown in the
UFO movie reported by radar technicians.  Security in Project Red
Light was so strict that no one stayed there more than six
months.  Mike did not see this movie himself, however.
     "While on vacation, he saw a story in Reader's Digest at his
parent's home which told of a UFO exploding over the test site in
1962 while being flown.  This would have been a recent story at
the time.
     "Mike is aware of the conventionally-powered disc built by
the Air Force which was publicized.  We both feel that this may
have been a cover-up for the real project which he describes.  He
also heard the stories about parts from a UFO which could not be
duplicated successfully by aerospace contractors on the west
coast, and many of the rumors about UFOs which have emanated from
Nellis AFB.  Incidentally, Nellis AFB operated 'Area 51' where he
says the UFO was flown.
     "This information has bothered him for 20 years, and he
wonders if it might be possible for documentation regarding
'Project Red Light' to be obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act."

According to various sources, 'Area 51' in Nevada, where the S-4,
Groom Lake, Dreamland complexes are located, is the same area
where the Stealth Bomber, SR-71, 'Star Wars' or SDI Technology,
and all manner of aerospace hightech had been developed and
tested; these include CIA experiments and tests.  Other names for
the 'Dreamland' complex include: 'The Ranch' or 'The Skunk
Works'.  This is where Francis Gary Powers, who flew the ill-
fated U-2 spy plane mission which was shot down over Russia
(where powers was held prisoner for some time), was trained. 
Incidentally, there are also rumors that the vast caverns which
have been excavated by the underground nuclear blasts in the
adjacent Nevada Nuclear Test range, have been and are being
connected by underground tunnels and used for top secret
purposes.  If this is the case one may wonder how the problems of
radiation residue were solved... [via 'clean' nuclear blasts?]

In the Spring of 1990 researcher 'Jason Bishop' sent copies of
the following report to a select few investigators, and later
gave permission for the report to be distributed among a wider
readership.  The transcript, titled: 'RECOLLECTIONS AND
IMPRESSIONS OF VISIT TO DULCE, NEW MEXICO - OCTOBER 23, 24, 1988'
is given in full below:

     "Upon arrival I was introduced to Dr. John F. Gille, a
French National.  Dr. Gille has a PhD in Math/Physics from the
University of Paris.  He had worked very closely with the French
Government on the UFO phenomena in that country (Note: There have
been many reports over the past several years that allege that
the French Government is working closely and secretly with a
benevolent hi-tech 'Scandinavian-like' human society which has
colonized a planet in the relatively nearby system of Wolf 424. 
Photographs of the craft utilized by these humans have been taken
in separate parts of the world, showing an emblem resembling an
'H' with an extra vertical 'bar' through the center of the
'crossbar'.  Much has been written, especially in French
publications, of the contacts with these beings, who allegedly
now live on a planet called 'Ummo' and are therefore known as
Ummites.  They warn against the predatory 'grey aliens' that have
been encountered during thousands of UFO sightings, and the
Ummites allegedly work closely with another human society in
'Vega' who like the Ummites themselves claim ancient ties with
prehistoric 'lost' civilizations on earth.  Much technical
information has been included with the reports on the 'Ummo'
contacts, and although it is uncertain what part John Gille might
play in that scenario, he is no doubt aware of the 'Ummo'
accounts themselves - Branton).
     "In the early 1980s a radio technician working at Area 51
reported seeing a saucer on the ground.  It was some 20 or 30
feet in diameter, he said, and when it flew, it moved silently
through the air.  The technician also viewed a number of wooden
shipping crates marked 'Project Redlight.'  Presently, the Air 
Force is trying to acquire 89.000 acres adjacent to the Groom Lake
facility and to place the nearby Groom Mountains off-limits to
the public.
     "Before and after the TV documentary 'UFO COVER-UP LIVE',
there had been talk of an underground alien base located in the
vicinity of the Groom Lake test site, known as 'Dreamland.'
...This adds a whole new dimension to the idea of a secret space
program and hints at fantastic secret programs that take [us]
more than one step beyond.
     "A friend of mine once moved to Riverton, Wyoming to escape
from terrifying mysteries he encountered in New Mexico.  He said
the locals at Riverton asked him, 'Are you here to work on the
secret space project out at the jet airport?'  Saucers were seen
close to the ground in Riverton,  One day my friend's truck broke
down and he had to hitch a ride to town.  A black Lincoln pulled
up and a man dressed in black gave him a lift.  The dashboard
looked like a computer console.  The MIB knew exactly where he
wanted to be left off in front of the post office, but my friend
had never told him.
     "ALIEN IMPLANTS - In 1980 when I lived in Glendale, Arizona,
I received a call from my friend Walter Baumgartner, who
published a magazine of limited circulation called ENERGY
UNLIMITED.  Walter was a natural technologist.  He said that he
had started working for a physicist by the name of Paul Bennewitz
at Thunder Scientific Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  He then
proceeded to tell me the fantastic story that Mr. Bennewitz had
succeeded in communicating with (although Bennewitz later said he
'interrogated' via a computer-radio link with an 'alien' computer
terminal - Branton) aliens at an underground base situated near
Mt. Archuleta in the town of Dulce that was close to the Colorado
border and situated on the Jicarrilla Apache Indian Reservation. 
He told me that these little grey aliens were abducting and
implanting people with a device inserted at the base of the skull
for the purpose of monitoring and controlling humans.  He said
that the government knew about this and was involved with alien
activities.  He also stated that the aliens feared our nuclear
weapons and nuclear radiation.  He told me that Paul was working
on a weapon that would be effective against these aliens.
     "UNDERGROUND BASES - On April 1 and 2, I spent 24 hours
visiting with John Lear at his home in Las Vegas.  He took out a
stack of papers and had me peruse them at my leisure.  His study
room had walls covered with aircraft photos and certificates. 
There was no doubt in my mind that John loved flying.  John is a
soft spoken individual and frequently, while visiting him, I have
watched him putter in the garden.  We discussed Area 51.  John
had some long distance photos of the Groom Lake facility.  The
one thing that stood out in one photo was the radio telescope
pointing straight up in the midst of a group of buildings.  The
scope was probably tracking any overhead spy satellites.  He
showed me the reference in the February, 1988 issue of GUNG-HO
magazine, that [insisted] that spacecraft were being test-flown
from this facility.  John heard rumors that the Greys had a base
under the Groom Mountains.  This is the one we believe is called
DREAMLAND.  One of my sources (a leak) says DREAM is an acronym
that stands for Data Repository Establishment And Maintenance. 
John told me the story of Mr. K, whose son Robert was trapped
inside a joint human-alien underground base in Utah.  This Robert
had apparently worked at Dulce Base at one time.  MR. K felt like
he was being given the runaround by the military in his attempts
to locate his son...
     "I learned that there were a few technical people who worked
at Sandia Labs in Albuquerque who were interested in alien
activity.  One man I talked to, C.R., knew a mysterious Colonel
Ronald Blackburn, who was reputed to have said that there were
600 aliens at the Groom Lake facility in Nevada.  C.R. had
investigated a UFO crash near Gallup, N.M. in 1983.  This one was
also investigated by Tommy Roy Blann.  I heard of Colonel Edwards
at Albuquerque who knew the AFOSI agent Richard Doty.  Doty had
talked to some investigators about the government cover-up.  Why?
I don't know.
     "WEIRD HAPPENINGS AT DULCE - On April 19, 1988, my wife and
I arrived at Dulce, N.M. at about 4:30 p.m.  Dulce was a
beautiful little mountain town sitting at an elevation exceeding
7,500 feet.  There was still snow on the ground by the Best
Western Motel.  I checked into the motel and called Gabe Valdez. 
He came over to see me about 9:30 p.m.  We talked about UFOs and
the cattle mutilations.  He said that he had not seen any mutes
since 1981-82.  [I] had him read a letter written by Richard Doty
in which Doty denies all involvement with UFO secrecy.  He said
Doty wasn't telling the truth.  This proved true, because Doty
started talking again (this is evidence of the kind of
'schizophrenia' existent in the Intelligence Community, which is
unfortunately the result of the conscientious attempts of these
servicemen to uphold national security and defend the
constitution which they have sworn to do, while at the same time
being warned by 'other elements' working in the 'Intelligence'
community to keep silent about the UFO phenomena, the Greys,
cattle mutilations, etc., and instructed to engage in other
activities which seem to be more destructive to national security
than supportive of it - Branton).  He told me that Doty wrote a
report that stated that Paul Bennewitz was being investigated. 
Later Gabe offered us a ride around Dulce.  He took us in his
patrol car and showed us some of the routes.  He said he saw
glowing orange-lighted airships flying silently around the area
frequently.  He never saw these airships in daylight.  We took a
look at the Gomez Ranch, site of some of the mutes that took
place in 1978.  We asked about Bennewitz's belief that there was
a secret underground alien base in the area.  He said he believed
about 80% of what Bennewitz said concerning alien activities in
the area, but he definitely seemed to think there was a base in
the area, but his idea of where it is located was different than
Paul's.  He thought that the base might be south of Dulce, closer
to the Gomez Ranch.  He said he had not found any entries to the
base.  He had found landing tracks and crawler marks near the
site of the mutes.  He invited me to come back sometime and climb
Mt. Archuleta.  Someday I would come back to Dulce, but I had no
idea when...
     "A lot started happening in October, 1988.  I started
investigating the case of a couple who had gone up to a plateau
on the south side of the Tehachapi Mountains not far from my
house.  At two in the morning they witnessed a large flashing orb
come up from the ground and rise slowly into the sky.  They
experienced about two hours of missing time.  Under hypnosis
performed by a local hypnotherapist who had taken an interest in
UFO abductees, we had found that the man recalled having been
taken to an underground facility.  He kept mentioning 'the
Colonel!'...

Brinsley Le Pour Trench, in his book 'MYSTERIOUS VISITORS: THE
UFO STORY' (Stein & Day Publishers., New York), gives some
interesting information concerning a possible UFO Base in South
America:
     
     "In recent years there has been a tremendous amount of UFO
activity over South America, especially Argentina.
     "In an article in 'FLYING SAUCER REVIEW', Gordon W.
Creighton described a massive UFO visitation of Argentina in
1962, and wrote:
     "'Indeed, during the 24 yours from midnight of Saturday 12
to Sunday 13 of May, UFOs were seen all over Argentina, and
landings occurred at several places, such as Oncative (Cordoba
Province) and Zapala (Nequen).  One newspaper said that this
flood of sightings might well mark a new era with regard to the
UFO problem, a key-day in the history of mankind.  The paper
added that strange cosmic happenings throughout the country had
profound emotional impact upon the many eyewitnesses...'
     "It can clearly be seen... that the UFOs were flying and
landing, wherever they wished, all over Argentina in 1962.  It
would seem very likely that they had established bases in the
more inaccessible mountainous areas.  However, at the same time
as all this activity was going on, many UFOs were seen to dive
into and emerge out of the sea off the coast of the country.
     "Creighton gives an interesting example: 'In an interview
with journalists which appeared in various papers in August 1962,
Senor Vicente A. Bordoli, a truck driver living at Mar del Plata,
stated that when driving southward along National Highway No. 3,
which skirts the South Atlantic coast of the Argentine, he and
his son Hugo Bordoli had frequently seen strange luminous craft
both entering and leaving the sea.  In his view these craft,
veritable flotillas of them, ARE CONTROLLED BY SIGNALS EMANATING
FROM UNDERWATER BASES, PERHAPS FROM LARGE SUBMARINE MOTHER-CRAFT.
Senor Bordoli concluded his statement by saying: 'IT IS
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE GULF OF SAN MATIAS
THERE IS A FLYING SAUCER BASE...'"
     "During 1963-64 UFO activity in South America continued, if
anything, on an even wider scale, involving Peru and Brazil, as
well as Argentina.  This infiltration of South America has
continued ever since... according to Spanish newspaper reports,
the UFOs have a base in the depths of Lake Titicaca, which
borders Peru and Bolivia, and is some twelve thousand feet up in
the High Andes.  People living near the lake have frequently seen
saucers heading toward it and vanishing (Note: Some sources claim
that the underground bases of the Andes are largely utilized by
the Pleiadean 'benevolents' and allied human space-faring
cultures - Branton).
     "Why so much emphasis on South America?  It would seem that
the continent contains many areas that are sparsely populated. 
In the Argentine, the land is rugged and ideal terrain for the
ufonauts to establish bases.  Many strange lights have been
observed flitting to and fro in the mountainous regions of the
High Andes.
     "If you think that Senor Vincente A. Bordoli's statement
about underwater bases is a bit 'way out', then there is one
scientist who would probably not agree.  He is the highly
respected botonist Ivan T. Sanderson.  He is a former member of
British Naval Intelligence, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
has taken part in many zoological expeditions around the world. 
One of the main themes of his notable book 'INVISIBLE RESIDENTS'
is the proposition that an underwater civilization has existed,
possibly for millennia, capable of space travel.
     "Sanderson points out that the oceans occupy three quarters
of the surface of our planet, and are often over two miles deep. 
We know almost nothing about what goes on at the bottom of the
oceans, but, Sanderson states, we do know from ships' logs and
from eyewitness accounts that many objects have been observed
entering and leaving the seas.
     "It is possible, then, that the UFOs have established bases
in the oceans for a very long period of time, and are now busy
extending these to land ones (bases) in isolated areas,
particularly in South America.
     "If this is the case, then surely the authorities must be
aware of this significant situation.  However, it is one of the
many things in the UFO story that we are not officially told
about.  One more instance of the great cover-up."

Dr. Clifford Wilson, in his 'UFOS AND THEIR MISSION IMPOSSIBLE'
(1974., Signet Books, N.Y.) describes the following information
which was submitted by Police Officer and 'abductee' Harold
Schirmer, who was the subject of experimentation by the alien
group known as the 'greys':
     "...He...claimed that he was told where UFO bases were. 
Although he could not understand it, he stated there were UFO
bases both underground and underwater.  He wondered if perhaps
these beings were careful to guard their own interests, for they
gave no information that would actually endanger themselves. 
However, they did say that one base was out in the ocean away
from Florida, out toward Bermuda.  This is in the area of the
infamous 'Bermuda Triangle' where so many ships and even aircraft
have mysteriously disappeared during this century.
     "Schirmer was further told that this particular vehicle was
an observation craft, and that the occupants had been sent to
collect samples of animals and vegetation.  He remembered also
that he was told that SOME HUMANS HAD BEEN USED in breeding
experiments.  He was convinced that something was done to the
brain patterns of those who were captured, and was definite that
he himself had been changed--as was evidenced by his earlier
withholding of details of the sighting.  By his obedience he had
become almost robotlike, ready to do whatever they told him to
do."

Researcher Paris Flammonde gives a description of what appears to
be the 'Dulce' underground base-network, as described by
researcher James Moseley:
     "...The intimations of strange pressure groups, purportedly
intent upon obscuring the true meaning of Flying Saucers, began
arising in the early 1950's, the most famous of these being the
'three men in black' and the 'silence conspiracy,' which Major
Keyhoe and others regard as an ominous element functioning within
the Air Force.  During the summer of 1956, SAUCER NEWS editor
James Moseley postulated an addition to this enigmatic company in
the June, 1956, issue of his magazine.  Theorizing that Flying
Saucers were originally being researched by the United States in
1946, were capable of speeds exceeding four thousand miles an
hour, and were operating from a supersecret subterranean base
below a southwestern state, he continued:
     "'The whole project is so highly classified that ordinary
military pilots and even the Air Force's saucer investigators on
Project Blue Book could not possibly know about it.  In fact,
this type of saucer IS NOT built by the American Government AS WE
ORDINARILY UNDERSTAND THE WORD 'GOVERNMENT.'  As fantastic as
this might sound... these saucers are actually built, operated,
and maintained by an organization which is ENTIRELY SEPARATE from
the military and political branches of the Government that we
know about.  Although a handful of people at the very top of the
Government know about the existence of this project, they have no
direct contact with it... I shall call this secret project, 'The
Organization.'"
     Moseley, according to Flammonde, "considerably elaborated on
the activities of this shadowy cabal with some very extravagant
revelations."

Researcher Val Valerian refers to an incident in 1988 which
indicated that at that time Project Bluebook was still as active
as ever.  Valerian refers to a Sgt. Robert Williams (pseudonym
for his protection) who was stationed in Honolulu from 1971-1973.
'Williams' was a photographer who worked for the Aerospace Audio
Visual Service (AAVS) which is headquartered at Norton AFB, CA.
     In 1971 Williams was approached by PROJECT BLUEBOOK to work
as a photographer, which he did until 1973.  On July 10, 1973
Williams was given TDY orders and a Top Secret clearance, and was
sent to Norton AFB and was briefed into a secret project
involving the photographing of alien beings and craft.  He was to
work with a Ron Smith (also pseudonym).  They were blindfolded
and put into a limousine with blacked-out windows and were driven
to their destination.  Both felt the car descend and found
themselves in an underground base.  Williams noted the time on
his watch, and that 45 minutes had passed since the beginning of
their journey.
     Both were briefed and led to a laboratory, where they found
two 'aliens' in the process of being autopsies.  Another alien
was still alive, held elsewhere.  The creatures were wearing blue
uniforms, and they noticed six scientists and two MARINE guards. 
It was later determined that they had been taken to the 29 Palms
Marine Base in S. California.
     They commenced to photograph the aliens.  The bodies were
black with green fluid/blood.  During the time when Williams was
photographing the live alien it terminated and at its death he
felt 'something passing through him'.  The scientists, he
noticed, had bland expressions on their faces 'like they weren't
all there.'  He was allowed to enter the disk which appeared
outwardly to be a 35' diameter disk, although inside it was
almost as large as a football field, indicating some type of
space-warping phenomena.  After this they were driven back to
Norton AFB and then returned to Honolulu.  The men noticed that
no one would speak to them, even their wives.  'Smith' later
disappeared and was never heard from again by Williams, who (as
of the early 1990's) now works in Nevada.
     Valerian stated that records show a disk did crash in NW
Arizona and was recovered on July 10, 1973.
     Aside from this 'Williams' stated that since the age of 3 he
experienced 'abductions' by human-like beings and was often taken
to a place with large white building that were LARGER WITHIN
THAN THEY WERE ON THE OUTSIDE, each containing 600 family units. 
During these episodes he was befriended by a human 'alien' girl
closely his age named Karin and this friendship lasted to later
years.  In relation to this Valerian states:
     "...Investigations of the 29 Palms underground base during
April 1989 tracked down some data about the geology of the spot. 
During the time when the area was under the sea, an earthquake
caused a large hole in the ground, causing a lot of water to
create a funnel-like structure in the ground.  Evidently, disks
go in and out of there all the time, and the Army has tried to
send cameras down there, only to have the cables cut.  One group
that attempted to go down on ropes were exposed to a blue gas and
had to be pulled out again..."

     "...It's definitely not a TOP SECRET that what's going on
within the bowels of those underground bunkers at S-4 and Area 51
in the Nellis Test Site is 'ABOVE TOP SECRET'.  Obviously there's
something very strange going on out there that the 'BLACK PROJECT
BOYS' have to hide regardless of what it costs.  If the public
were to become aware of what these 'Dr. Strangelove's' were
'creating' in those underground laboratories - I believe the
world would be shocked and horrified beyond all belief.
     "Need I remind you that it is your responsibility as
District Attorney of Lincoln County to UNCOVER - NOT COVER UP
crimes that are being committed in your county.  Other questions
arise.  Is there a dereliction of duty by the District Attorney's
office?  Do you have a conflict of interest?  And for whom do you
serve?
     "I am deeply concerned as is the American Civil Liberties
Union in seeing that the constitutional rights of all Americans
who live in or pay a visit to Lincoln County are PROTECTED - NOT
VIOLATED by the WACKENHUT S.S. (Security Service), your Sheriff's
Department, or anyone else.
     "Correct me if I am wrong, but at one time or another did
you not take some sort of oath to uphold and defend the
Constitution of the United States?  Or is the Lincoln County
District Attorney EXEMPT from upholding such 'antiquated
trivialities' as the United States Constitution?
     "Would you be willing to share with me information as to how
and why the Wackenhut S.S. is ALLOWED by your office under the
color of law to STOP, INTIMIDATE AND HARASS 'sightseers' on
public land?  Are they 'ABOVE THE LAW'?  Are they IMMUNE TO
PROSECUTION?
     "What law is it that allows the WACKENHUT S.S. to drive
unlicensed vehicles on county roads in the state of Nevada at
speeds far exceeding the posted limit?  Does your office now
allow them to search sightseers' vehicles without warrants? 
Maybe some judge in Lincoln County issued them 'POCKET WARRANTS'?
And if so, what judge has the legal authority in this country to
issue such 'invisible warrants' to the WACKENHUT S.S. or any
other PARAMILITARY MOB?  What law gives you the legal authority
to allow the WACKENHUT S.S. to stop, interrogate and intimidate
sightseers, tourists, campers and naturalists?  Or for that
matter, do they need ask your permission at all?  Are they a law
unto themselves?
     "Are these 'HITLERIAN HARASSERS' CIA, NSA, 'Black Project',
U.N. or paramilitary personnel?  Just where is the law in Lincoln
County?  Asleep?  Or do you simply WINK YOUR EYE at all those
Orwellian incidents? 
     "The obvious collusion between Wackenhut and the Sheriff's
Department necessitates that these questions be asked.  It has
become EVEN MORE NECESSARY to prevent our freedoms from
disintegrating - that these questions be answered.
     "Who are these men who stand behind LOADED FULLY AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS, show NO IDENTIFICATION, wear camouflaged clothing,
DISPLAY NO BADGES, wear no emblems, drive unlicensed vehicles and
who show no warrants when they stop and interrogate American
citizens on American soil?  They demand to see identification,
social security cards, driver's licenses, take pictures of the
sightseers, record their conversations, search their cars and
write down the license plate numbers for 'zher files' just like
in Nazi Germany.  They have even on occasion drawn their weapons
and aimed them at American citizens - with what can only be
described as INTENT TO KILL - should the 'sightseers' not
instantly obey their commands.   Surely you must be aware that
all this is taking place on public 'tax-payer owned' land in your
country.  Why are you allowing this, Mrs. Cafferata?
     "Who are these paramilitary people that you seemingly
protect from prosecution?  Under whose authority do these NEO-
FASCIST FORCES operate?  Yours?  MJ-12?  Some cryptic banking
cartel?  The Skull and Bones?  The Jason Society?  Global 2000? 
The Tri-Lates?  I know it's not the Boy Scouts, Mrs. Cafferata. 
Just who is running the show?
     "I doubt seriously that the average citizen of Lincoln
County who pays your salary has any idea what's going on.  I feel
quite certain that the residents of Rachel, Pioche and Alamo
haven't secretly met with you in some obscure smoke-filled back-
room to persuade you to make sure that the WACKENHUT S.S. remains
'immune' from criminal prosecution.
     "I don't quite understand why you're doing what you're doing
or rather NOT DOING.  Does somebody have some sort of hold on
you?  Does some 'secret society' pay for your co-operation?  or
are you and the Sheriff's Department just working with the
Wackenhut S.S. VOLUNTARILY, without pay?
     "In Nazi Germany, Hitler had a quasi-government group called
the S.S. Beyond their borders, they called the collaborators
WAFFEN S.S.  They were authorized by the Fuhrer to operate
'BEYOND THE LAW'.  Is this the case in Lincoln County?  Has the
Wackenhut S.S. replaced the WAFFEN S.S.?  
     "Under what law have you allowed unmarked black helicopters
to buzz, harass and threaten the lives of tourists in Lincoln
County?  If these aircraft are not, by the law, allowed to
threaten the lives of people who come to Tickaboo Valley 'to see
the sights', then why hasn't your office prosecuted these
criminals?  Are they above the law?  Or has 'SELECTIVE
PROSECUTION' replaced CRIMINAL JUSTICE in Lincoln County?
     "Are you ready to testify in a court of law that you are
'unaware' that BLACK HELICOPTERS have been swooping down upon
innocent travelers - in an attempt to scare them or try to kill
them?
     "...If you don't recollect any such incident, let me remind
you but one.  Norio Hayakawa, Gary Schultz and a party of
sightseers were buzzed by an unmarked helicopter - in a LIFE-
THREATENING MANNER in May of 1991.
     "Under what law do you allow such outrage to occur over
Lincoln County roads?  Have you bothered to even so much as
'discuss' this attack with those who authorized it?  Why haven't
they been brought to court to explain their OFFENSIVE ACTION
taken against those innocent, unarmed people?  Did you make NO
ATTEMPT WHATSOEVER to prosecute the perpetrators of that crime? 
Might I remind you that it occurred over a Lincoln County road,
which is under your jurisdiction?
     "...On March 26 of this year Norio Hayakawa and Shinichiro
Namiki were stopped by Undersheriff Gary Davis and Deputy Sheriff
Doug Lamoreaux, at which time their camera equipment was
'FORCIBLY CONFISCATED' on public land by these TWO ARMED MEN.  In
years gone by this was considered HIGHWAY ROBBERY.  Under what
law do you justify such outrage now?  or is theft now legal in
Lincoln County?
     "Is it not incumbent upon you to at the very least bring
Lamoreaux and Davis up before a judicial hearing in front of an
unbiased judge?  In case you've lost their numbers, Mrs.
Cafferata, you can reach Undersheriff Davis at 702-725-3447 and
Deputy Sheriff Lamoreaux at 702-725-3645 in their off-hours when
they might be more inclined to give some straightforward answers
about this outrageous behavior.
     "I realize that you are at the very least angered by my
inquiries.  If your arrogant attitudes towards this reporter is
any example of how you slip, slide, duck and hide from inquiries
by others in the Fifth Estate - you must hold those of us in the
media with very deep disdain.  Your attitude reminds me of
Richard Nixon.  He had a similar attitude towards the free press,
but you are in good company - so did Adolph Hitler.
     "This country has been very good to me, Mrs. Cafferata.  I
owe a great debt to our forefathers who had the courage to stand
up and speak out against tyranny imposed upon them by King
George.  They had to fight for the freedom we enjoy in this
greatest nation on earth.  So I am not about to remain silent,
turn my back and do nothing as you would prefer me to do while I
see our constitutional rights that they FOUGHT and died for
twisted and turned by the knaves of Lincoln County law
enforcement.
     "I realize that you are paid handsomely to do and say what
you do, Mrs. Cafferata.  I have no problem with you making money,
just as long as you don't 'sell out' our freedoms to obtain your
fortune.  Our freedoms are not for sale and we are not willing to
see you surrender them to some 'Neo-Fascist' NEW WORLD ORDER.  I
fear that if your belligerent behavior is allowed to remain
UNCHALLENGED in Lincoln County, Nevada may well be on its way to
becoming Nazi-ized.
     "I thank God that we still have freedom of speech and
expression in this country.  In the Communazi nations of this
world I would be investigated and subject to arrest for daring to
make such inquiries of even a tank-town backwoods bureaucrat.  Up
until recently in the Soviet 'SLAVE SYSTEM' the KGB would concoct
evidence against individuals like Solzhenitzen who dared to bring
to light the grizzly Hitlerian horrors happening in the Gulag
Archipelago.
     "As deeply as you might be in 'COVERING' for those who are
'COVERING UP' the Nightmares at Nellis, I believe that you will
soon discover that the overwhelming majority of those who receive
this letter are far more dedicated to 'UNCOVERING CRIMES' being
committed against American citizens in your neck of the world -
than you will be in prosecuting crimes committed in Lincoln
County.
     "Incidentally, irrespective of how 'new' you might think
that President Bush's NEW WORLD ORDER is, his 'presidential
proclamation' is definitely not new.  Adolph Hitler used the
exact same words to describe 'his plan' for Global Government
some fifty years ago.  Now Bush claims he wants to accomplish it
'IN A KINDER AND GENTLER WAY.'  But that's just on TV - for the
mindless masses.  For your edification THE NEW WORLD ORDER is the
title of Hitler's second book......the first one was MEIN KAMPF. 
It served the Fuhrer and his Fascist followers who justified the
INHUMAN WRONGS of 'HUMAN RIGHTS' committed throughout Europe. 
This included justification for Dr. Joseph Mengele's monstrous
'MEDIAL EXPERIMENTS' that were performed on the unsuspecting
population in order to develop a MASTER RACE.
     "Of course there's a difference between Bush and Hitler's
phraseology.  Hitler talked about a THOUSAND-YEAR REICH.  Bush
talks about a THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT.
     "I know that it shatters your senses for someone like myself
to suggest that 'GENETIC ENGINEERING' and 'MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS'
could be going on in the miles of tunneled underground facilities
at S-4 and Groom Lake - and that history could be repeating
itself, yet this topic has come up repeatedly over the past
year - from 'several sources'.
     "I recall one case in point when the Lincoln County
Sheriff's Department picked up a young black woman named Trassie
Wingfield who was wandering about in the Tickaboo Valley one
night near the perimeter of the base.  As I understand it she's
in the Navy and is stationed out of Hawaii.  She claimed to have
been abducted and brought to 'the facility' twice for 'medical
experiments'.  Did your office investigate her charges?  And if
not, why not?
     "According to the FBI and Department of Justice records,
well over 300,000 children end up MISSING AND UNACCOUNTED FOR in
this country every year.  Where do you think these 'MILK CARTON
KIDS' disappear to, Mrs. Cafferata?  Certainly they can't all get
swallowed up in the inner cities or wind up in shallow graves off
lonely backwoods roads or served up on the table of some
psychopathic cannibal.
     "In Bill Hamilton's book 'COSMIC TOP SECRET' there may be an
answer to this question.  In it is described a literal Hitlerian
'hell under the earth' which was created at a TOP SECRET-BLACK
PROJECT base called Dulce.  That one is located in New Mexico,
not far from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  I have enclosed
two pages from Hamilton's book for your review.  Though I suspect
you will - I pray that you don't - take these murderous matters
lightly.
     "I have recently heard stories of people who, under
hypnosis, have described in nightmarish terms what goes on in
these God-forsaken underground facilities like DREAMLAND.  Based
upon what I have heard, I can only describe the 'HELL-HOLES' as
'FRANKENSTEIN FACTORIES'.  According to my sources, these
laboratories are run by a small army of I.G.O.R.S. (the Invisible
GOvernment's Robotons) who follow 'the party line' as did their
Nazi predecessors who ran the Hitlerian Hospitals at Auschwitz
and Dachau.
     "I don't know what Hitlerian horrors are happening out there
with PROJECT REDLIGHT but I feel it's imperative to ask the
Attorney General of the State of Nevada to appoint a special
(independent, non-government) investigative team to uncover just
what kind of 'experimentation' is going on in the underground
facilities at S-4 and Groom Lake.  The country has the right to
know if the missing 'MILK CARTON KIDS' are being used for
'genetic engineering' and if adult 'abductees' are used for
mutation experiments and body parts.
     "I would think that if you refuse to cooperate with such an
investigative team or to even address this issue - one might
conclude that you, like your predecessors, are following close to
'the party line'.
     "A final question about 'THE FINAL SOLUTION', Mrs.
Cafferata.  As you know, Adolph Hitler was reported to have
ordered HIS I.G.O.R.S. to gas millions of innocents in 'death
camps' like Auschwitz and Dachau 'TO CLEANSE' the world of the
Jewish problem.  Did you ever ask yourself what happened to those
atomic scientists in Germany who were developing the A-Bomb and
the dozens of doctors who conducted those medical experiments on
human beings?  Is it merely coincidental that there exists many
thousands of Malthusian Minded Men who openly accept 'MASS
MURDER' as necessary to bring about a NEW WORLD ORDER?  These
Orwellian ONE WORLDERS working within the Bush 'Black Projects'
believe that the world's population has to be reduced by
1,2500,000,000 people by the year 2000 (25%).  If you don't
believe, there are madmen with this mind-set... Read GLOBAL
2000's MASTER PLAN.
     These Malthusian men have the minds of monsters.  They use
'controlled conflicts' (war), 'bacteriological warfare' (AIDS),
sterilization, mandatory abortion and 'weather modification' to
create droughts that result in mass starvation.  To achieve their
'end objective' for global government upon the ashes of all
national-sovereignty they are willing to mass-murder millions. 
That requires, of course, the 'cooperation' of officials like
you, Mrs. Cafferata, to follow 'the party line'.  
     "I know it's very hard for you to accept, even in your
wildest thoughts, that an AMERICAN AUSCHWITZ could exist UNDER
American soil.  I bet it's even harder for you to conceive that
it could be fully functioning in Lincoln County.  Are you willing
to testify in a court of law that it doesn't exist there, Mrs.
Cafferata?
     "During the Third Reich even 'the party liners' who lived
around 'the death camps' were reluctant to believe that 'their
government' could commit such horrendous crimes as were
discovered after the invasion of Germany.  Yet, although they
heard faint screams in the far distance and cries for help - they
SHUT THEIR EARS TO IT.  Even though they saw carloads of people
by the thousands going into the concentration camps - and none
return - THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO IT.  Even when they saw billows
of smoke belch from the bowels of the burners and smelt the stiff
strong stench of burning flesh - THEY SHUT THEIR SENSES TO IT. 
And, in spite of the fact rumor had it that 'unspeakable horrors'
were going on in the 'killing camps' - THEY SHUT THEIR MINDS TO
IT.
     "Those that asked local government officials, like yourself,
WHAT WAS GOING ON were told that it was all 'TOP SECRET' and
involved 'NATIONAL SECURITY'.....and NOT TO QUESTION AUTHORITY. 
Then one day when the war came to a close and the truth was
unearthed, the 'party people' acted shocked when it became public
that millions had been mass-murdered.  They just couldn't believe
that genocide, infanticide and homicide could have been not only
allowed but carried out to the last deadly detail by other 'party
liners' in the government who just went along...... saw nothing,
said nothing and did nothing.
     "When it came time for the TRIAL at Nuremberg, Mrs.
Cafferata, the 'Vun, Vurid, Vurkers' who ran the killer
concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau - 'CLAIMED
INNOCENCE'.  Even those 'party people' who shoved and shoveled
their victims into those carnivorous crematoriums - 'CLAIMED
INNOCENCE'.  THEY SAID THEY WERE JUST OBEYING ORDERS.  They said
they were merely carrying out the MASTER PLAN - for the Master
Race.
     "I am not accusing you of any crime, Mrs. Cafferata.  It is
possible that you could just be so inordinately apathetic or just
so blindly obeying orders that you cannot see, or simply refuse
to open your eyes to what's going on.  Or do you 'CLAIM
INNOCENCE', Mrs. Cafferata?  The Attorney General's office will
be the judge of that.  It is the A.G.'s responsibility to
determine if any crimes have been, or are now being committed or
allowed 'to be committed' by your office.  Ultimately, any
decision with regards to the 'wholesale abuse of the law' is made
by the prosecution who tries the case, be it in a court of law or
before the bar of public opinion..."

     Perhaps those of us who read these words should heed the
battle-cry of the Jews when they say: "NEVER AGAIN!!!"

The Sept. 10, 1990 issue of 'UFO UNIVERSE' related the following
under the title-heading, "WILLIAM F. HAMILTON III - UFOLOGY'S
'MYSTERY MAN' TO REVEAL 'COSMIC TOP SECRETS'".  Hamilton's
research and literature may be obtained from - William Hamilton -
c/o 249 North Brand Blvd., Suite 651., Glendale, CA  91203:
     
     "Until just recently, William F. Hamilton III managed to
keep up a relatively low profile so that he can continue his work
in private and without needless interruption from well-meaning,
and nevertheless prying eyes.
     "Admittedly, his name is not known in every household, but
the fact of the matter is that 'Bill' is highly respected among
his peers.
     "Indeed, what he has to say is as important and vital as the
words of flying ace John Lear and former Navy intelligence
officer William Cooper, who have gone on record regarding the
alien conspiracy.
     "In fact, much of what Hamilton maintains is consistent with
the theory that there is a massive government cover-up on UFOs
and alien visitations that reaches right up to the president's
private office door, and that the U.S. military has made a secret
pact with a group of aliens known as the 'Greys' (others might
consider this as some kind of 'pact with the devil'.  According
to them, there's not that much difference, when one considers the
alleged atrocities perpetrated by the 'Grays', secret atrocities
which make Hitler's S.S. killer squads look like boy scouts -
Branton)...  (They) are on earth...mutilating cattle, and
abducting humans for experimental purposes.  Supposedly the Greys
have taken over several Top-Secret underground military
facilities, AND certain branches of the government (who) are
working hand-in-hand with these entities to bring about total
domination of the world, while a SECOND group of extra-
terrestrials is here trying to protect us...
     "Of a highly controversial nature, many of Hamilton's
statements may seem overly 'radical' to even his closest
associates, not to mention other investigators who refuse to even
seriously consider the documentation he is able to present to
bolster his case.
     "...About ten years ago, a few scientists and engineers, who
worked for NASA and shared an interest in UFO abductions, came
together to form a group they called Project VISIT--Vehicle
Internal Systems Investigative Team.  They studied about 130
cases of UFO abductions with the goal of constructing a model of
UFOs, their operation, and the entities who crew UFOs.
     "They found:
     "--UFOs have bright interior lighting.
     "--Abductees undergo a medical-type examination with
apparently highly sophisticated equipment.
     "--Burns are suffered by many abductees.
     "--Time loss - from 20 minutes to 3 hours is common. 
Project VISIT member, Dr. Richard Niemtzow, described the crew
members as four feet tall, hairless, grey in color, with no nose,
a small mouth and large slanted eyes.  The Grey humanoid is
emotionless and communicates by telepathy.
     "The Greys have earned a reputation quite different than the
Nordic blondes and other reported species.  Most of the
abductions are done by greys and more than one variation of Grey.
The Greys do most of the biological intervening on abductees. 
Tans, Whites, and Blues (i.e. 'Greys' of 'other' skin colors -
Branton) have also been reported by abductees.  I have personally
had some sort of encounter with what I call the Whites.  They are
small with extremely white skin and black, wrap-around eyes.
     "EARTH MADE SAUCERS - In April, 1984, Lt. General George
Bone, Vice Commander of the U.S. Air Force Systems Command was
killed while test flying a secret aircraft over the Groom Lake
area, a top secret facility located about 100 miles north of Las
Vegas, Nevada.  This facility is designated 'Area 51.'  The
Systems Command reputedly uses this facility to test fly spy
planes, such as the SR-71 Blackbird or its successor, the Aurora.
According to the February, 1988 issue of GUNG-HO magazine which
ran a feature article on Area 51, some of the craft being flown
out of that test facility would make George Lucas drool!...
     "He told me," Bishop continues, "that he has not worked in
his chosen field for fifteen years, having devoted all of his
time to research on UFOs.  Dr. Gille is an amiable, forthright
man.  He has no reservations about expressing his own views on
the subject.  He does hold several beliefs that border on the
paranormal.  Dr. Gille had his wife, Elaine, with him.  My
personal view of him is one of caution.  Until I get to know him
better, I feel that I should be very careful.
     "Edmound Gomez is a rancher.  His ranch is 13 miles west of
Dulce (Note: Accounts given by others state that the ranch is
east of Dulce, but whatever the case it's safe to say that it's
13 miles FROM Dulce - Branton).  From 1975 until 1983 the Gomez
ranch was the scene of most of the cattle mutilations that took
place in the northern New Mexico/southern Colorado area.  He told
me that his family homesteaded the Dulce area 111 years ago and
that as a result of these mutilations, they lost $100,000 in
cattle over an eight year period.  One of these cases occurred
only 200 yards behind his home.  He showed me the area.
     "Edmound was very open and discussed with me the various
mutilation cases that had occurred on his ranch and on those of
others.  Upon our return from the mountain trip, he invited me to
his home where he shared with me various photographs, clippings,
letters etc. relating to the cases.  He loaned me several
overhead photographs of the Mt. Archuleta area.  I hope to be
able to have them examined through image intensification
techniques.
     "Edmound also told me about the many times that combat ready
troops had been spotted in the area.  Some of these troops were
found in areas that are only gotten to through four-wheel drive
trucks or on foot.  (This is VERY rugged country).  The troops
were also spotted in areas that only the Apache has permission to
go.  When the reported 'experimental aircraft' went down in 1983,
there were 'hundreds of troops, armed to the teeth' reported in
the area.  When approached, the troops would run and disappear.
     "Participants in the Mt. Archuleta expedition were: Gabe
Valdez, Edmound Gomez, Dr. John Gille, (name deleted), Manuel
Gomez (Edmound's brother), Jeff and Matt Valdez (Gabe's sons). 
Because of Gabe's position as head of the State Police in Dulce
and Edmound being a part of the community, we were given
permission to go onto the mountain.  It is located on the Apache
Reservation.
     "We left about 1430 hrs, Sunday, 23 October 1988.  We used
Gabe's four wheel drive pickup truck to get up the mountain.  The
road was incredibly difficult.  At one time we had to dig out the
side of the mountain in order to allow the truck to pass.  At
about 1730 hrs we arrived at the proposed campsite.  It was on a
relatively flat area about 300 yards from the peak of Mt.
Archuleta.
     "Gabe and Edmound both told me that in 1978 there was an
agreement between the Ute Indians (Colorado) and the Federal
Government.  This agreement consisted of the Ute Nation receiving
all the territory now occupied along the New Mexico/Colorado
border with the explicit agreement that they would strictly
enforce a 'NO TRESPASSING' regulation along the border of their
territory.  Therefore, it is not possible to even cross the Ute
Reservation without special permission from the Tribal
Headquarters.  If caught without this permission you are liable
for a fine and/or jail and expulsion.  There is now a road
leading to the Archuleta area through the reservation.  It is
patrolled by the Indian Forest Service.
     "At 1951 hrs. all seven of us spotted a very bright light
coming from the northwest at a very high rate of speed.  The
object appeared to be boomerang shaped with a very bright light
just below its center.  The light was a bright white, blue and
green.  As it approached, it slowed down (obviously under
intelligent control), seemed to reverse direction, finally
stopping.  When it stopped, a shower of what appeared to be
sparks were emitted from each end of the boomerang, and then it
began moving forward again and disappeared from sight at a very
high rate of speed.  All this took place in approximately 10 to
15 seconds.  We attempted to take a picture of the object but
were unsuccessful.
     "About 2200 hours we climbed to the summit of Mt. Archuleta
and watched for about an hour and a half.  We could see across
the canyon in the moonlight.  This canyon wall is where Paul
Bennewitz (prominent and well known physicist and UFO
investigator) claimed an 'alien' base is located and that during
the night their ships are seen entering and leaving cave openings
in the cliff wall.  During our stay on the peak, we saw two very
bright lights on the cliff walls in the exact location where Paul
said the base openings were.  There are no roads on this cliff. 
The light would appear suddenly and then fade over a period of
time until you could not see them.  At this time we also heard
voices that sounded like radio transmissions.  The voices were
not understandable but they were there none the less.  The same
light pattern was seen by myself and Edmound Gomez as we sat on
the cliff...at about 0100 hours.  We also heard voices.  At one
time we thought we could hear trucks moving but we could not be
sure about this.  After 0200 hours there were no more sightings
or sounds.
     "On Monday, 24 October 1988 the entire party climbed to the
peak once again.  We were looking for evidence that there had
been a crash of an 'experimental aircraft' flown by an Air Force
General in 1983.  This crash was reported in the newspapers for
two days as a small plane and then hushed up.  The craft was
rumored to be a captured UFO, flown by Americans.  We were hoping
to prove that there indeed had been a crash but also to find some
physical evidence.
     "Dr. Bennewitz reported that the craft had clipped off a
large tree in it's descent, had hit another tree, regained
altitude, skimmed over the peak of Archuleta, (and) hit a third
tree in the valley north of the peak.  It was then reported to
have hit the ground, flipped over twice and came to rest.  We
found the trees as reported by Bennewitz.  They were all in line
with each other and the final resting place.  The first tree was
about 40 inches in diameter.  It was hit about 30 feet off the
ground.  There was no fire.  I have taken samples of this tree
for analysis.  The other two trees were smaller (approximately 12
to 20 inches in diameter).  There was evidence of fire with
these.  Samples of (these) trees were also taken.  Between the
second tree and the third tree we found large pieces of what
appeared to be part of the first tree.  One piece was burnt while
next to it was one that was one that had not been burned. 
Samples were taken.  While searching for physical evidence, a
standard issue style ball-point pen was found.  This is of the
same type used by the U.S. Government but can also be purchased
by the general public.  Strange to have been found in such a
remote place as this canyon.  The alleged crash area showed a
large semi-circular area with new vegetation.  The area above the
semi-circular area was covered with new vegetation also.  Samples
of the soil of this area were taken.
     "My overall impressions of this trip are mixed.  I believe
that there is definitely something going on in the area.  What it
is, I do not know.  Perhaps there is a base there.  Perhaps it is
jointly operated by 'aliens' and the government, as claimed by
John Lear.  Then again, it could be a US base so super secret
that there are no fences around to arouse any suspicion... then
again I cannot say for sure.  I do know that the evidence that we
found and saw definitely points to the fact that something is
going on in this area."

'Commander X', the alleged intelligence community 'insider' has
stated the following in relation to the Dulce Facility:
     "THE PHANTOM BOARD: ABOVE THE LAW... Most meetings of 'The
Dulce Board' are held in Denver and Taos (New Mexico).  A former
U.S. Senator has full knowledge of Dulce.  He was among the group
that included a number of very prominent government figures who
toured the base (i.e. probably upper levels only - Branton).  In
1979, an 'animal mutilation' conference took place in
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  This meeting was used to locate
researchers and determine what they had learned about the link
between the 'mute' (i.e. mutilation) operations and the 'Alien'
government.
     "Another Senator knows about the 'Ultra' secrets at
'Dreamland' and Dulce.  Several of my official sources have
confirmed this to me.  So do many others in government... this is
what the UFO researchers are up against...so be careful.  You
know more than they want you to know.
     "They have also underwater bases off the coast of Florida
and Peru.
     "More detailed information will be released in the near
future: photos, video tapes, documents, etc.  Watch out for
'Special Agents' among you now.
     "In the 1930's, DIVISION FIVE of the FBI knew about the

'Aliens.'
     "A FASCIST cabal within this country had John Kennedy
assassinated.  Look to the links within the larger Umbrella...the
'WEB' of a fascist totalitarian secret police state...within the
Pentagon; JCS, DIA, FBI (Division Five); DISC/DIS and the DIA. 
Note: The Defense Investigative Services insignia is a composite
of the Sun's rays, a rose and a dagger, symbolizing 'The Search
for Information, Trustworthiness and Danger.'
     "This links with caves used for 'Initiation Rites' all over
the world...ancient vaults, retreats, (underground 'bases')..."
etc.
     Commander 'X" also stated that: "Recently, participants in a
'field investigation' of the area near Archuleta Mesa, were
confronted by two small hovering spheres.  They all became
suddenly ill and had to leave the area.
     "We have passed the point of no return in our interaction
with the 'alien' (i.e. 'gray') beings.  We are guaranteed a
crisis with will persist until the final REVELATION (or
conflict).
     "The crisis is here, global and real.  We must mitigate or
transform the nature of the disasters to come and come they will.
Knowing is half the battle.  Read the book, THE COSMIC

underground base is located in southwestern Colorado near the UTE
mountains.  The son apparently worked at the genetics lab under
Archuleta mesa near DULCE, NM and finally grew disgusted with
what he was observing.  Subsequent probes into the retention of

Oklahoma resident Christa Tilton, who claims to have been
'abducted' by a joint CIA-Alien (Gray) techno-imperical combine
to underground bases north of Tuscon, Arizona and to the 'Dulce'
base northeast of Albuquerque, N.M., traveled to Dulce, New
Mexico some years ago with some friends.  While there, she
claims, she met a men who had access to a dirt road which led
into the Mt. Archuleta area.  She claimed that while up near the
mesas she had a 'strange' feeling inside her, especially when
they reached Mt. Archuleta itself.
     Suddenly she told her friends to drive her some miles south,
where they came to a lake.  Though she had never 'consciously'
been to that area before, she nevertheless could describe it in
incredible detail.  Pointing to a mountain range on the far side
of this particular lake, Christa said that THIS was where she had
been taken by her abductors, entering via a flying disk into a
base beneath these mountains, apparently one of many such
openings to the mega-base below, which allegedly consists of
numerous interconnected subterranean complexes.
     The driver of the truck was surprised, and explained that
several witnesses claimed they observed flying objects entering
and leaving those very mountains.  This would ted to indicate
that this massive underground complex, parts of which according
to some sources date back to ancient times, covers a vast area
and descends to extreme depths.  Most of the entrances are hard
to pinpoint although some researchers claim to know where certain
of the 'tunnel' openings are located.  Christa's experiences are
supported by other 'abductees' who describe similar abductions to
the very same underground complex.

One caller who phoned in to KTKK (K-Talk) radio in Salt Lake
City, in August of 1991, made some rather startling claims
concerning high-tech 'Philadelphia' type experiments that had
allegedly been conducted at the Top Secret Labs in or below the
Nevada Military Complex.
     The caller referred to a 'Shawn Morton' who had allegedly
visited 'Area 51' and talked to a man who said that most of the
technology depicted in the first 'Star Trek' series of the 1960's
is now in the possession of the 'Secret Government'.  
     Morton also was told that, possibly prior to the
'Philadelphia Experiments', top scientists who were tied-in with
the secret government succeeded in 'teleporting' a china plate
and that they were surprised that the object materialized in
'reverse image', including the lettering!  After some time they
allegedly worked out the bugs and attempted to teleport a human
being.  The first human being to be teleported (apparently after
several successful experiments with animals, etc.) was the man
known among some New Age groups--and several government officials
including Bush and Gorbachev who met with him at the 'Malta'
conference--as 'Maitreya'.  This guy, if we are to believe
Morton, was eventually 'teleported' and made to materialize in
front of a stunned African tribe as an 'experiment' to determine
how successful they (the Secret Government) could be in future
attempts to pass-off 'Maitreya' or others like him as gods or
divine entities in order to manipulate the religious passions of
the unknowing masses towards their (the secret government's) own
ends.  Apparently the Illuminati, which actually intended from
its conception to recruit the most intellectually advanced minds
in the world to help establish their technocratic dictatorship,
is using such extremely high-tech knowledge to bring to pass
their own agendas of absolute control, rather than to help the
diseased, poverty-stricken and starving masses of the planet. 
One need only read their 'Global 2000' report to see why they
will do nothing of the sort, since they believe that the world
population must be kept as a CONTROLLABLE MINIMUM!

The following is a transcript of a letter which was sent by John
Lear to researcher TAL LeVesque.  In order to fully understand
the references concerning the 'reptilian' connection more fully,
the reader should study the adjacent 'CRIM-RAM' [COSCON2] files. 
The letter, dated October 6, 1990, states:
     
"Dear TAL,
     "Many thanks for your recent, very interesting letter.  I
showed it to Bob (i.e. Lazar - Branton) and he thinks we are both
crazy.  He does not believe that Dulce exists.  Bob went through
extreme brainwashing at S-4 so I can understand his feelings. 
About the time that he was brainwashed, maybe a little before, he
told me that Dulce was mentioned up there once or twice in
conversations that he was not part of...but that he overhead. 
Since that time he has forgotten even that part.  Since I know
Dulce exists, what Bob thinks does not affect me in the least.
     "A source of mine that is a security guard at the test site
tells me that currently there are 5 types of aliens there: The
Greys, the Orange, the reptilians, the ones that look like [the
aliens] in the movie 'V' and the ones that look so ugly that they
take your breath away until you get used to looking at them.
     "I now believe that a very large Saucer crashed near Sedona,
possibly 2 years ago and is in the process of being retrieved in
sections, as it is too big to remove in one piece.
     "The recent stories in Aviation Week, I believe, are
attempts to buy more time, to mislead the public and to confuse
the issue (Note: Lear is here referring to the article in the
Oct. 1, 1990 issue of AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, titled
"Secret Advanced Vehicles Demonstrate Technologies For Future
Military Use".  The article referred only to the fairly well-
known super-advanced jets being tested in Nevada, giving the
impression that these may explain all of the 'UFO' sightings in
the area - Branton).
     "Again, I appreciate very much your fascinating letter and
look forward to more information on Dulce.
     "With much respect and admiration... JOHN LEAR."

On July 30, 1992, radio announcer and reporter for RADIO FREE
AMERICA, Anthony J. Hilder, sent the following letter to Patty
Cafferata., Lincoln County District Attorney., Pioche, Nevada
89043., 702-962-5171.  Several dozen copies were sent by Hilder
to other researchers as well as several activist, political,
legal, media, patriot, congressional, and (real) 'National
Defense' officials:

"Dear Mrs. Cafferata,
     "I am calling on the Attorney General of the State of Nevada
to initiate an immediate 'FULL SCALE' Grand Jury Investigation
into the activities of the Wackenhut S.S., your office and the
Lincoln County Sheriff's Department.  The reason for the urgency
of this action is because of the rapidly increasing number of
'LIFE THREATENING' situations CREATED by unidentified
paramilitary personnel who operate under the color of law to
harass, intimidate and suppress the constitutional rights of many
hundreds of American citizens and Japanese nationals who come to
view the Unidentified Flying 'Saucer-Shaped Disks' being tested
over your county.
     "It is my prayer that with the prodding of the people and
the press that the Attorney General will launch 'this
investigation' in time to avert one of these innocent individuals
from being murdered by that paramilitary mob or winding up as a
permanent prisoner in one of the 'strange' underground
'experimental laboratories' below Dreamland and S-4 within the
Nellis Test Range.
     "During my conversation with you on the afternoon of June 6,
I made repeated attempts to acquire the names of six individuals
who were arrested last month by the Lincoln County Sheriff's
Department somewhere in the Tickaboo Valley.  As a reporter, I
sought your professional cooperation.  I did not get it.
     "Not only did you refuse to reveal the names of those
arrested and their 'alleged' violation of law - you continually
badgered me for my home address, phone number and specifically
just what radio stations would be broadcasting the story.  Could
it be that you wanted to 'cover-up' the story?  As I stated, I
simply wanted to cover the event.
     "I am curious as to the reason you would attempt to prevent
the media from reporting the arrest.  Obviously you didn't want
me to contact those people for their side of the story before
their arraignment.  Is there something you fear from honest
disclosure?  What is it that you don't want to know?  Could it be
that these arrests were illegal?
     "Did the Sheriff's Department violate 'the constitutional
rights' of these citizens, Mrs. Cafferata?  Has it become the
policy of Lincoln County Sheriff's Department WITH YOUR APPROVAL
and under the color of law, to 'HARASS AND INTIMIDATE' the
curious onlookers who come to your county to sit beneath the
stars in the high desert, hoping to see and possibly photograph
the strange and 'alien lights' in the night sky for which that
region has now become famous?  Is this a crime in Nevada?  One
might wonder if Lincoln has now become the first county in a
'Hitlerian Superstate' of a NEW WORLD ORDER - where freedoms are
suppressed and terror tactics are 'public policy'?

Well, things were really fucked up this month.  I couldn't seem to
get ahold of Dark|||Knight (if i do, im gonna kick your ass ;D ) and
I didn't think I was ever going to get an Issue 4 out, and along
came weapon dealer, so everyone say thanks to him and stuff.  As always,
and probably more than ever, we need articels.  If you have any 
problems, suggestions, or would like to help us out send your email
to hatredonalog@hotmail.com, cause I am the founder/cheif editor and 
such.  I know this issue is kinda lame, expect something muchos better
next month (which I am doing too). If anyone has Webspace they absolutely 
must give away to a deserving and fairly new H/P 'zine.... i think you 
understand. ;)

Oh yeah, Shoutz out to: Logicbox, pinguino (thank you for tha stickahs!),
qbert, overkill^ (d00d, your great!), XBS, Wepndlr, spee (hi) and everyone 
else associated with System Failure!@
