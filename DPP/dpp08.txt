 Ever wanted your room to be /\/\3g4 /<-r4d 31337?  Well, here are some 
 tips on decorating your room.

 1.  Don't use Light Bulbs

  Grow Luminesent Bacteria, and use it to light your room instead of those 
 stupid light bulbs..  Here is a simple way to grow the bacteria:

 What you'll need to create the growth medium:

  30g  NaCl
   1g  Glycerol 
   10g Peptone (Bacto-Peptone) 
   3g  Beef Extract  (to obtain solid medium you should add 15 g of Bacto-Agar) 
   Dilute the ingredients in water (pH should be about 7,3)  
   Fill with H2O up till 1000 ml

 The cultivation should be conducted in temperature 18 - 22°C. Liquid 
 cultures should be well aerated (the aeration pumps may be used or 
 cultures should be shaken well). It is necessary to support sufficient 
 amount of oxygen needed in luminescence reactions.
 
 There, now you have the growth medium made.. time to store it.
 In the sterile plastic tube mix 0,15 ml sterilised glycerol and 0,85 
 ml liquid culture of luminescent bacteria.  Shake it, and freeze it,
 with Liquid Nitrogen, somewhere around -70°C.

 Let that baby grow for a couple of weeks.. and it should glow in
 the dark.  Of course, to glow it needs oxygen, and if you want it to
 glow nicely.. make a stirring device for it.  I suppose you could use
 a little air pump from an aqaurium or something.  Be creative.. 

 2. Steal anything with a telco. sign on it
  
  Here is a small list of things to snatch while your out and about:

 o  Payphone signs
 o  Payphones
 o  No Trespassing signs (from CO's, Remote swtiching stations, SLC's, ect)
 o  The covers from pedistals
 o  GTE van doors [slash me looks at skully and sonik]
 o  Burried line markers (orange flags)
 o  Posters for prepaid phone cards
 o  Orange Fiber Optic warning signs (by train tracks usually)

 3. Fill all empty space

 Put up posters all over all your walls (and ceiling) and cover your
 floor with stolen telco. docs, equipment and cabling.  Go out to cheezy
 little computer stores, flea markets, and garage sales and buy 
 old/new/semi-new computers and setup a network in your room.  Next buy 
 an air conditioner (window kind) or two, otherwise 8-9 computers all
 running at the same time might make your room get slightly warm.  Fans 
 also might be a good idea.  If you have any money left, buy some big
 speakers and a decent stereo.  You know what to do with that.

 Anyways, now your room is all scary, you can be happy.  Your parents
 won't go in anymore, and you will be able to irc in peace.

 DISCLAIMER: The activity described in this article is highly illeagal and you
 can get a long time in jail for doing it.  Be careful if you ever do it and
 REMEMBER, no one is responsible for your actions but yourself.

 INTRO:  This is a method of obtaining valid credit card numbers tested numerous
 times over the internet.  I have never seen an easier, safer, quicker way to
 obtain numbers.  If you follow the instructions carefully you should end up with
 more numbers than you know what to do with.  A friend of mine did this and got
 over 150 card numbers in 2 days!  The greatest thing about this is that you can
 be 99% sure that these are valid numbers due to the fact that the card's owners
 are the people that give the numbers to you!  Make sure you read the entire
 article before trying it.  Well, let's get started.
 
	Okay,  i'll try to give you a basic overview of how this works.  What you
 do is start up a web site pretending to be a large company of your choice that is
 involved in the internet (Pick a big company like Yahoo, CompuServ, AOL, Excite,
 etc.).  This web site is going to appear to be a survey that the users are paid
 to fill out.  At the bottom of the survey you will ask for a credit card #, exp.
 date, address, etc.  The unsuspecting users will fill out the survey thinking
 they are going to get $10 or something and will type in their credit card number
 s, which will be sent directly to you!  

 	Now that you have a basic idea,  I am going to be REAL specific as to what to
 do.  Again, this method DOES WORK.  Remember, people can be really stupid. 
 First, you have to think of a company that deals with the internet.  ISPs,
 On-Line Services, Search Engines, Free Homepage & E-Mail Providers all work very
 well.  Now, you must create a web site.  If you want to be sucessful at all, you
 are going to have to have your own domain.  This cost $70 or you can just card
 it.  This is the only money you will ever have to shell out for this scam.  Have
 the name of the domain have something to do with the company you picked.  Make
 it sound like that company would name it and you might want to include their
 name in the URL.  Once you register your domain with the profiteering gluttons
 over at the InterNIC or hire a web site design & hosting company such as
 simplenet, prohosting, etc., you are ready to start coding your html.  This is
 crucial, so make it VERY belivible.  First you will need a title graphic.  Take
 the company's logo and work it into the design.  If you suck at making cool
 graphics, get one of your buds to do it.  Make this look friendly and business
 like, not dark and mean.  A good way to do it is have the logo say the name of
 your fake survey, and then near the bottom of the graphic say "Presented by
 (your company here)."  Alright.....well, now that you have your top graphic, 
 it's time to make your survey.  If you don't know the HTML code for forms, you
 can rip it from my PLA site.  You might also want to use radio buttons or check
 boxes.  Under your title graphic you should have a small paragraph saying that
 for the company to serve internet patrons better they want your imput and that x
 amount of dollars will be credited to their credit card as a thank you for
 taking the survery.  People buy this and CompuServ actually used to do that. 
 When asking questions, ask questions like the ages of people in their househ
 olds, yearly income, how often do they buy certian products, what are their
 hobbies, intrests, and job, etc.  Ask the kind of questioins they ask when you
 register for Hotmail, etc.   Then do a small paragraph about that they should
 enter their CC#, exp. date, and complete billing address and $xxx will be
 credited to their card.  Then include a radio button for each type of card
 (VISA, MC, AMEX, etc.) and a form for each of the CC#, exp. date,etc.  At the
 bottom have a Submit and a Clear button.  VERY IMPORTANT have it submit to a CGI
 thing, never have the data sent to your e-mail address!  This will look very
 unprofessional and you might not get ANY numbers if you use your e-mail address. 
 Most web hosting companies will offer you CGI when you buy a package with them. 
 Have it direct them to a page that says "Thank you for taking our survey!  Your
 credit will appear on your next credit card bill!"  Then in small print slide in
 a little copyright notice.  Upload your html and graphic.  You are now done with
 Step One.
 
	Now for Step Two.  If you don't already have a POP3 account, create one.  It
 doesn't really matter what the username is as long as its @yourdomain.com.  
 Now here's what to do: Remember the company you picked? Now what you do is find
 all the e-mail addresses you can with that domain.  This shouldn't be too tough
 especially if you picked a Free E-Mail provider.  Hotmail has so many customers
 that about any word or name you can think of exists as a Hotmail account.  If yo
 u picked an ISP, there may be a member list on the homepage.  Well, anyway, find
 as many addresses as you can.  Now take all the addresses and paste them into
 the To: section of a new e-mail message.  For the Topic use something like "From
 you friends at (company name)."  In the body talk about how they can get paid
 however much money just for filling out an easy survey and give them the URL. 
 Read over an e-mail you got from some dumb company and copy the writing style. 
 Be sure to start out your letter Dear Friend, or something, and remember:  Be
 FORMAL and use correct spelling and Capitalization.  If you don't get many hits
 doing that, you are probably doing something wrong.  Send me a copy of the
 message and I'll tell you if it's any good. 
 
	Well, that's all you should need to know, Good Luck.  BUT, in DPP 9, I will let
 you in on some cool things to do and precautions to take when you order things 
 with the cards. 
 
 Oh by the way,  a good place for web hosting is www.darksphere.net.  It is run
 by my bud Silicon Daemon so if you are going to pay for your web hosting,  (DO
 NOT try to card things from him, he doesn't take CCs anyway!) check there. 
 Great rates, fast service.........tell 'em DPP sent ya!

 I have a few scams i'm quite proud of...and i'd like to share them with the
 readers of DPP :)...ok, thats enough of this ugly messy introduction...here come
 some scams...:)
 
 Six Flags Great Adventure:
 
 	Well now right away don't be distracted by the fact that I put Great Adventure. 
 For all i know these could work at ANY theme park, but I FOR SURE know they will
 work at Six Flags Parks, and I have expreience at Great Adventure.
 
 1. Employee Notice
 2. Ok, so how do i get in?! I'm broke!!!
 3. Whew! It's hot! I need a drink, but i'm still broke!!!
 4. Ai-ite, it's night, but now i'm hungry, and still broke!!!
 5. Hey check out this laser tag game, however, i'm broke!!!
 6. How would i go about changing my monetary status?
 7. I need to go home, but my redbox's all wet and i have no change!!!
 
 1. Well, if you work there, like i no longer do <i fucking quit> DON'T BE A
 FOOL! Don't even attempt to steal money..and watch it while sneaking a pretzel
 or churro or funnel cake, THEY're watching.  By they I mean the Loss Prevetion
 Department.  They're high tech bastards.  Ok, ever see on TV those tiny pencil
 point type cameras?  Oh yeah, they use those, ALOT of them, and they dont just
 monitor, they RECORD.  I've seen too many friends go down like this.  Stealing
 money WILL get you caught.  By the way, don't pull ANY of these Six Flags scams
 if you work there or plan to work there, many employees will recognize you and
 report you.  This is a precaution, do what you want, but as a FINAL warning,
 PLEASE be careful, and ALWAYS remember, you leave footprints wherever you walk,
 COVER THEM GOOD!

 2. On to the goods.  You're standing outside the gate.  You do NOT have a
 ticket.  how the hell are you going to get in?!  Well, ALAS, there is only one
 way i know of.  Great adventure uses a stamp that can barely be seen as a yellow
 stamp, but glows in the black light.  Now many of us have this stupid SpyTech
 inkpad which can only be seen in the dark. If you have that you're soo set,
 smear some on your left hand and walk into the re-enter gate.  If they ask
 questions get REALLY bitchy and say you arent a slob and you wash your hands, it
 seems to be smeared, anyhow, bitch untill you get in, whatever you do DON'T GIVE
 UP.  Thats how you get caught.  Well, in the case that you have NO IDEA what
 SpyTech is cuz you werent an eleet little kiddo like i was, you're not out of
 luck!  As long as someone in your party, prefferably a clean someone, has a
 season pass or a ticket.  In this case, let them go in, then they should come
 out and get their hand stamped.  Next they should find a secluded place to meet
 you. Now comes the cool part, Lick your hand, get it really wet <you could
 always use the water fountain, but saliva ALWAYS seems to work better>.  Smack
 your left hands' together untill the saliva/water forms an airtight seal, and
 PRESTO! you are both stamped!  Now, dont be an idiot and come in at the same
 time as your friend, people may get suspicious.
 
 3. Ok, so now you're hot, thirsty, and broke, right?  Get over it, go to the
 water fountain!  Haha, just kidding.  Now the only choice is do you want soda or
 water?  Water is the easy one, go up to a stand with a soda fountain and say,
 can i have some icewater, but none of that expensive poland spring shit.  Now,
 soda's a little trickier.  You'll have to be with another person for best
 results.  Go up to a stand with a fountain and say, my friend and I both want
 some water, can we have it in a big cup so we can share it? Now cups aren't
 counted so they'll usually be happy to oblige, and if they aren't...BITCH! The
 customer is #1 all the time, they'll give it to you.  Now, i know what you're
 thinking, now I just have a big water idiot!  Well, spill it out, or drink it if
 you so desire.  Go up to another stand that has a fountain <out of sight from
 the first> and say that you spilled your soda/juice.  They'll give you a new
 one, company policy, and even if they don't believe you, just act cool and dont
 worry, they'll do it, it's company policy.

 4. Hungry eh? Well you have a few options here.  You can get anything for free,
 no problem.  Lets start small, fries, make sure you know exactly what you want. 
 Lets say you want fries and a burger.  Go to a place that has MANY ordering
 windows.  Go up to one and say you dropped your burger and fries, but make sure
 you remember EXACTLY what you told them you dropped, they should give it to you
 no problem, and if they dont, you guessed it, BITCH.  Now if they ask you WHERE
 you dropped it, just say oh, over by the <insert ride name here>, some asshole
 bumped into me, he didn't even apologize <go on untill they're sick of you're
 little spontanius story> and they'll give it to you.  Now, if you want to risk
 getting thrown out of the park, go for the biggs.  There are two big places in
 to go to, the grill and the pizza place.  Now, lets say you want a 4 person
 order of ribs, which comes to like $40.  Now that's a scam, so take your time,
 stalk the restaurant.  Wait untill you see one of the cashiers get replaced and
 when the supervisor who accompanied them leaves, and get on their line.  If for
 some reason you get on the line of a cashier who'se been around, abort.  now
 once you get in this person's line and remember your order good <ie. 4 orders of
 ribs and 4 cokes> and come up with an exact place where you "dropped it" and a
 BIG story, and STAY calm while keeping in mind, it IS company policy to replace
 dropped food.  Tell the cashier what you dropped where you dropped it and your
 sob story.  Now, first thing they'll ask you is, do you have you're reciept?  Of
 course you don't so search your pockets and after pulling out no reciept say
 that it must have been on one of the trays.  Now the next question they'll ask
 is where you dropped it so they can get someone to <wink><wink> clean it up. 
 A.K.A. check out if you really dropped it.  Your response must be immediate and
 sound something like: well when I droppe dit these grounds guys wearing green
 clothes said they'd clean it up for me and told me that i could get a
 replacement.  This should get you either food or a manager. If you get a
 manager, retell they SAME story and they'll probably ask you to sign something
 which you should proceed to do with a false name. If none of this works walk
 away cursing under your breath loud enough for them to hear you and loudly say,
 I am going to complain, and i'm never coming back to great adventure again <loud
 enough to get everyone in the restaurant's attention>. If this STILL doesnt
 work, then you're out of luck, keep walking. 
 
 5.  Well, if you've never played laser tag, definately pull this one off.  All
 you have to do is pay for a game, play it, and theres a big timer at the top,
 when it gets down to the last minute, scream for the attendant and act VERY
 frustrated with your laser.  Tell him it doesnt work and it hasnt worked since
 the game started, act really bitchy and shake the laser.  When he tries it say
 "See, see!!!" He'll say that it's working perfectly.  But you must claim that it
 isnt.  By now the game should be over, and you've had your 14 minutes.  Now
 bitch to the attendant at the desk and he'll either give youa refund or a free
 game, and if you don't want the free game, bitch untill you get a refund!
 
 6. No money? Need money to play Area 51 at the arcade and try to beat me but I
 am #1 (NIN) anyhow, perhaps you want to win a souvineer for youre girlfriend. 
 These are too risky to scam, so heres what you do.  Walk around the park, find 2
 arcades and 2 soda machines, the expensive bottle ones.  Now tell the attendant
 you stuck a dollar in the change machine and no change came out, tell them you
 stuck 2 dollars into the soda machine but the light blinked and NO soda came
 out, and you oushed ALL of the buttons, you should come out with around 6 bucks,
 more than you had before.  This is a fairly well known trick, but whatever you
 do, do not claim to have put a $5 in because they open the machin and look at
 the last 3 bills, and if none of them are $5's, they warn the park about a
 possible scammer and you're screwed out of ANY type of scamming.
 
 [Editor's Note: I do this at school with the $0.50 machines when im broke..
  i can usually make about $2 off of it =) ]


 7. Now this one is kind-of Great Adventure specific.  There is a giant chair
 that morons pay like $10 to get their picture taken in.  At night the chair is
 closed due to lack of light.  BEHIND the chair is a phone. Since you're a
 Phreakish Punk, pick it up dial 9, your area code and your number.  And nobody
 will notice, because you are behind a GIANT chair!  Anywhere else, just look for
 a phone with nobody around and use it, be careful though.
 
 Thanks for putting up with my typos and i hope this has taught you a bit about
 scamming Six Flags to death, but wait! Theres more, non-six flags scams!
 

 Ok, heres the generic scam section.
 
 1. I'm at the movies, but drinks are $3, help me!
 2. Mall + Broke + Hungry = scam!
 3. Final Note <Springer>
 
 1. Well heres the deal, go over to a garbage can and pull out a cup.  Most movie
 theatres offer free refills.  Take a key or any sharp object and poke a tiny
 hole in the bottom of the cup.  Now splash some water on your shirt in the
 bathroom or at the water fountain.  Bring the cup to the attendant and say i'd
 like a refill of <insert beverage here> but my cup has a leak man, can i get a
 new one?  Sure, they'll give you a new one, with unlimited refills of course.  
 
 2. Ok, so you have the situation set up what are you going to do? Well, all
 these chinese places are willing to give out samples and so is roli boli.  Pass
 by those places and pick up some samples.  Now put a hat on and get some more. 
 Next it's time for desert.  Go over to McDonalds and say can I have a free
 sample of ice cream.  They'll give it to you, in a nifty little cone too :) .
 
 3. Well as my final note, i'd like to say that neither nothingg <me> or the DPP
 or the Twisted Nickel <my local group> endorse using any of these methods to rip
 off evil domineering companies nor to we encourage using these methods.  I am
 merely pointing out the many flaws in a system thought to be perfect.

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
 ÃÄÄ.4.Ä[ Making friends with a lineman...  And then ripping him off ]ÄÄÄÄÄ´
 ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ[ MMX Killa ]ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 Have you ever realized that lineman know more about the network then you do
 (for the most part)?  If you live in Bell Atlantic territory, have you
 noticed that they keep thick manuals in the thin middle compartments of
 their cherry picker trucks?  In your quest for knowledge, there is no such
 thing as too much.  That's why we should always speak to the techs.  And
 once we have their trust...
 
 Step 1:  Find a tech lurking around in the neighborhood.  Not to hard in
 populated areas.  If you live in the boonies, you'll have to do a little bit
 of work.  What I would do is find a cross box in your area, one near alot of
 homes.  Then I would walk by every once in a while to see if anyone's there.
 It's usually not too much of a task, even in the subburbs.  They're ALWAYS
 somewhere around.

 Step 2: Evaluate the situation.  Where is their truck parked?  Can anyone
 see me if I grab something from it?  Would the lineman notice if I grabbed
 something from it?  Is this lineman a tough guy that could (if necessary)
 run me down and beat the living fuck out of me?  You get the idea.
 
 Step 3: Begin an _intelligent_ conversation.  Age plays a big factor in this
 part.  The younger you are, the more difficulty you might have talking to
 him.  Begin your conversation by saying something like "So, that's a TS-21
 X89 handset from harris dracon, right?"  Of course don't say that exactly,
 but attempt to impress him with your vast knowledge of linemans handsets.
 If he says "you know more about it than I do" just tell him to check the
 inside of the handset to see.  If they say, "how did you know that?", tell
 them either that:
 a) if you're 16 or older: "I just got an internship at (one of the CLECs),
 for the switch technician".  Of course don't say "one of the CLECs", say the
 name of one, like RCN, TCG, Cablevision, whatever the fuck you want to.
 b) if you look like you're 12, tell him that you want to become a lineman.
 c) if you are a full grown adult, then you may have a problem.  If I were
 you, I would just get a job with one of the telecom companies.  After all,
 if you're that interested in it, you might as well work with it.
 
 Step 4:  Get your info.  This could be very difficult for people who aren't
 good at social engineering.  If you ask a stupid question like, "why doesn't
 my red box work on the phones around here", than you probably won't get a
 very good response.  Ask something like, "what kind of switch do we use
 here" and then begin moving on to questions that you want to know.
 
 Step 5: Backup plan.  If he doesn't want to talk, get him back for being an
 asshole.  Steal something, it doesn't matter what.  Some of the more fun
 things to steal are: covers for the cans, the "DataStar" computers, tool
 belts, manuals, you know what you want.
 
 Step 6: Go home and bask in your knowledge.
 
 If you run into the same lineman twice, and they remember you, you're off
 even better.  I've found that they trust you more if they know you better.

 <weev:#p1mp> you said you gave your body odor to bio
 <weev:#p1mp> you must be really smelly to be able to transfer it
 <grez:#p1mp> He dcc sent it.
 <weev:#p1mp> whoa
 <grez:#p1mp> New smell packet transmission protocols.
 <weev:#p1mp> it must be REALLY smelly to be able to survive through DCC
 <grez:#p1mp> Its the same pricipale as making a phone call.
 <grez:#p1mp> It is converted into digital signals, then rebuilt at the destination.
 <weev:#p1mp> wow
 <weev:#p1mp> i've got to learn more about this technology
 <grez:#p1mp> Just talk to phen0m.
 <weev:#p1mp> no
 <weev:#p1mp> i don't want people who use proggies to tell me how it works
 <weev:#p1mp> i want the people who made it to tell me how it works

 I was hanging out in #p1mp, and phen0m said he gave his BO to bio.
 I didn't know smells could be transmitted over the 'net, so I made
 an inquiry about it. And thus the above conversation was generated.
 
 ..... and so my quest began.
 
 I arrived at Micrabsoft Inc, hoping Phil Mates, the richest man in
 America, and possibly the world, would know somthing about smell
 packet transmission protocols. I went in and asked for Phil Mates.
 This really big guy came up. I asked him if he was going to take me
 to Phil Mates. He said yea. He took me to a closet and anally raped
 me. Then he threw me out. I cursed at how uncomfy my anus felt, and
 left. I had to see Phil Mates! Where could I see Phil Mates? Then I
 picked up a tip online on alt.geeks.horny.celeb.stalkers.philmates
 and they said they were going to capture him and hold him for a
 ransom. They said I could ask my question after they all had their
 way with him. 

 I went into the old warehouse that they said he was being held in.
 When I went through the door, all the doors and windows locked. I
 had a spotlight put on me. They said that they were mad ereet
 haxors, and that I was now a member of the pheer nation. They said
 I needed to be initiated. They said that they had my dox and that
 they would give me BO through the computer if I did not cooperate.
 AGAIN WITH THE SMELL TRANSMISSION PROTOCOLS!! HOW DO THEY WORK?!?
 
 Well, they all anally raped me. I noticed how big my anus was
 getting.

 Then I went to DefCon, and THERE HE WAS!! Phil Mates was at DefCon!
 I asked him why he was here, and he said this is where mad ereet
 haxors hang out. I told him I was a mad ereet haxor and an honorary
 member of the pheer nation. He gasped and showed me the tattoo on
 his buttocks. It said pheer nation leader. He said he was at DefCon
 to meet with the haxors and get mad ereet security ideas and recruit
 kiddies for the pheer nation, and his private all male modeling
 company.

 I asked if he knew about smell packet trassmission protocols, and
 he said he'd tell me if I could be anally raped by him. I let him
 have his way with me, and he took me to the center for E.S.R.A.D.
 Which means Electronic Smell Research and Development. He told me
 that electronic smell transmission protocols worked just like
 regular packet transmission protocols, except you needed a special
 phone line made out of a special material that used a special band
 to use it.

 He showed me the technical specs of it all. I was finally happy.
 But it turns out Phil Mates actually STOLE the idea from someone
 else, and that the person that originally came up with it made it
 more efficient, millions cheaper, and way easier to accomplish
 than Phil Mates. Oh well.

 My ass, before and after my quest:

 One day, after school i came home, and went on the internet as 
 usual.  I was browsing around some neato burrito phreaking sites
 when i came accross the pheer nation (www.pheer-nation.com) and i
 was amazed at what i saw... STSP (Smell Transfer Signal Protocol),
 the UNST pr0ject and GibOS hacking.  It was all new to me, so i
 stayed up all night and read everything they had to offer.. i was
 just amazed.  I knew what i had to do.. become part of the pheer
 nation.  i knew it wouldn't be an easy thing to do, because all
 only the best hackers get into it.  I started off by emailing
 Phil Mates.. he told me that i had to goto a 2600 meeting and tell
 them i wanted in, and i would be initiated.  I knew i would have
 to be elite, but i didn't give up all hope.

 When I got to the 2600 meeting I saw 12 kids that were all older 
 than me standing around chatting, so i walked up and started to
 mingle... then after about 10 minutes, i told them that I wanted into
 the PHeeR nation.  They told me to come with them, and they took me
 to an abandoned warehouse and proceeded to assrape me (all of them!).

 I woke up in the morning laying in my backyard.. my anus was very sore
 indeed.  I shoved some toilet paper in my underpants for the bleeding
 and just tried to ignore the pain.  I went and ate some fruit loops, and
 found a note on my table from the pheer nation.. it read:
 
    "31337 hax0r:
     
    You are now in the pheer nation, you will be provided with a
    pheer-nation.com shell account and access to private warez ftp.
    The key for #pheer-nation is assrape, and don't forget it, otherwise
    you won't be able to irc with the rest of us!  have phun...
                                 - Phil Mates "

 I was so amazed, I went and turned on my computer immediately.. i fired
 up mIRC and went onto DALnet and joined the elite #pheer-nation... it was
 one of my greatest moments.  I went to the private warez ftp and was 
 stunned.. win98, MS OFFICE '97 professional, Adobe Photo Paint... it had
 everything.  I went into my newsgroup reader and changed my .sig file.. i
 added that i was an elite member of the pheer nation.  then i posted to
 alt.phreaking about how i blotto boxed my town twice.  I felt soooo elite
 i decided to look at some pr0n.. asian bondage and facials.  I whacked off
 and had a j0lly ol' time.  Then i turned my computer off and went to sleep.
 Tommorow was busy.. i was going to install Gibson OS on my computer and
 make it super-secure.. so no one could ever hack me.

 I have a few things to get off my back.  Here it goes...
 You know what i really hate, is people who know they don't know 
 their shit and still try and school people on the iRC, Usenet,
 or any other medium.  These same people put up phreaking sites
 full of texts that they haven't even read, or worse put up a copy
 of "the anarchist's cookbook" and encourage *more* people to 
 blow the crap out of themselves.  These people do it so that they
 can feel good about themselves, cause they're a hacker!  

 If people openly admit they they don't know what they're talking 
 about and say, ask specific questions such as "What is AMA?" then 
 they might be able to helped.  But if they just say "teach me to 
 phreak."  they aren't going to get anywhere.
