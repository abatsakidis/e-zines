Highway and Road Disturbances
By hatredonalog (hatredonalog@hotmail.com)


Ever just want to annoy the piss out of someone just driving on
the highways, minding their own business?  If so, i have the 
solution for you!  You just use a few of my ideas, and use my
specialized precautions, and you won't get hurt/arrested/dead.

The first thing you have to remember about the highway is that
people drive _cars_ on there.  This will be your greatest obstical,
and you will probably need to watch out for them.  If they hit
you, you can get badly hurt, dead, or just end up pissing someone
off.  This can suck ass greatly, so look before crossing the 
road!

Now, the list of ideas for disturbing people who are minding 
their own business and did nothing to you:

  1) Shoot bottle rockets down the road (horizonitaly) at
     on-coming traffic, or back at people's bumpers.
  2) Lay Razor wire accross the highway during a low period,
     and video tape people as they skid out when they hit it!
  3) Climb on top of one of those large road signs and throw
     rocks/other crap at cars.
  4) Sit on the side of the road/highway and use a large Strobe
     light on people when they pass by you.
  5) Drive a R/C car around on the highway and bother drivers, 
     so that they try and run it over.
  6) Release small animals all over overpasses and freeways.
  7) setup some fake roadblocks and annoy drivers.
  8) Play tennis accross the road, using the white line(s)
     as the net.
  9) Acutally setup a net in the middle of the road.
 10) Tape Roman Candles to the walls on the sides of highways
     (pointing in, towards the road) and light them off one at
     a time.  If you can, get the bigger ones with more repeater
     shots.
 11) Setup a Motion detector with a camera, and mount it over
     the road on a stop light, and take pictures of everyone.
 12) Shoot water guns/throw water balloons at traffic.
 13) Throw ice cold water out on the hot ass asphalt, and watch
     as drivers slow down because of all the steam.
 14) Run accross the road widely yelling about the damned bready
     creatures trying to get you.
 15) Blow up an overpass.
 16) Dig up a huge part of the road (on top of a hill) and watch
     people's cars fly into it.
 17) Get many of those Stress Squeeze balls and put them everywhere
     on the street.  Also try eggs or ping pong balls.
 18) In the middle of the night, spray paint over the white lines
     in the middle of the road. Now drivers will be confused(!)
 19) When doing (18) remove road signs and/or move them around.
 20) Setup a motion sensor hooked up to a big buzzer, so when people
     go by, they'll get a big 'ol morning wake up call.


Well, don't do these things.  Why? Because they're dumb, illegal
and really fucking annoying.  if you didn't get the hint, it's 
satire, so don't take it seriously.

                             THE ART OF CLONING 
                             ------------------
                                   by gela



        Do not get confused by the title of this article and believe that
you are reading about how to clone cell phones or pagers.  This is going to
explain the art of cloning animals.  Specifically sheep.  And maybe people.
By the time you finish this, you will probably have a little bit of knowledge
about cloning and maybe you will be able to put it to use.  And remember, it's
illegal to clone humans in some countries.  So if you clone anyone, try to keep
it quiet.  To those ethical types offended by human cloning: Fuck off, I'll play
god if I want to play god.

        Before you learn how to clone something, you need some backround information. 
First of all, you need to know what a cell is.  A cell is the smallest possible
living organism.  A large group of specialized or differentiated cells form
tissue.  A bunch of tissue makes organs.  A group
of organs forms an organ system.  When you combine all of the organ systems, 
you create an organism.  In the early stages of development, a cell divides
several times and creates other cells that are totipotent (they can form any
type of cell such as nerve cells or blood cells).  As the organism matures, the
totipotentcy wears off and the cells differentiate.  Many scientists thought
that it was not possible to reverse the differentiation of cells.  But it has
been discovered that if you force the cell into a state of rest, or quiescent
state, the cell will regain its totipotency.  This is important for cloning an
adult cell.  Inside the cell are a bunch of little things
that do special tasks.  Those little things resemble our own organs in the sense
that our organs perform special tasks. The things inside the cell that we will
be examining are the chromosomes and the nucleus and maybe the mitochondria. 
The nucleus is like our brain.  It controls the functions of the cell.  In the
nucleus is the DNA (Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid).  The DNA stores all of the
information about genes.  For something to be a clone, it must have an exact
replica of the animals DNA.  The mitochondria is the power house of the cell. 
Some scientists think that the mitochondria controls aging.  More on that later.

        Just in case you do not know what cloning is, I will tell you.  Cloning is
creating an exact genetic copy of an organism.  This occurs in nature all of the
time.  Identical twins are clones as are offspring from assexual reproduction. 
Keep in mind, a clone will may not have the same personality.  It will only be
the same physically.  

        The method used to clone animals is Nuclear Transfer or Nuclear Transportation. 
Nuclear Transfer, as the name implies, consists of exchanging nuclei between two
cells.  Nuclear Transfer does not only have to be used for cloning.  I will give
a step by step explanation on Nuclear Transfer cloning later.  To clone using
Nuclear Transfer, you need a donor cell of an animal to be cloned and an
unfertilized egg cell, or oocyte.  To prepare the oocyte, you must remove its
nucleus.  Then you put the nucleus of the donor cell into the oocyte.  When that
is finished, you wait until an embryo is formed.  Then you put the embryo into a
uterus of the mother.  This is how you would clone from a donor cell of an
embryo.  If you clone from an adult, you would need to have the donor cell in a
quinscent state.  The reasoning behind this is because the embryo donor cell is
young and totipotent and the adult would have to be turned back into a
totipotent cell.

        Now onto the step by step explanation of how to make your very own clone.  You
will need several items to do this.

1. donor cell from the animal to be cloned
2. unfertilized egg cell
3. three petri dishes, one for the cell culture, one for egg cell, and one     
for changing the donor cell to a totipotent cell
4. something that will allow you to remove and replace the nucleus of a cell
   preferably a very small needle, laboratory kind
5. a microscope
6. and something to administer an electric shock

        First, take a tissue sample of an animal that you want to clone.  Place the
tissue sample into a petri dish.  The petri dish will have to be covered with a
mixture of nutrients so the tissue will survive.  Wait a couple of days until
you have a bunch of healthy cells.  Then take those cells and place them into
another petri dish without nutrients.  By starving them, you will force them
into quinscense which will restart the cell back into totipotence.  When it
looks like it is totipotent, find your egg cell and remove its nucleus using
your needle.  Then, take the donor cell, and place it inside the egg cell.  Now
you will have to fuse the donor cell to the egg cell using an electric shock. 
The electric shock will also trigger development of the embryo.  Recently, two
scientists accomplished this using chemicals to start the cell division.  When
you place the nucleus of the donor cell into the egg cell, the egg cell
reprograms the DNA of the donor cell.  Scientists are not s!
ure how this works.  You can tel
l if the egg cell fuses with the donor cell by looking at it.  You then let it
sit there for about seven days.  By then, if you did it correctely to this
point, you will have an embryo.  So you then place the embryo into the mothers
uterus where it will develop.  Then you wait until the mother delivers the baby
and you should have your very own cloned animal.  Now getting back to the
mitochondria.  A problem may exist when cloning from an adult oocyte.  When you
extract the nucleus, the mtDNA, or mitochondrial DNA, stays with the oocyte. 
That might not seem like a big deal, but scientists believe that the
mitochondria controls aging.  The way it happens is when the mitochondria dies,
the cell begins to die.  So, if you clone yourself using the egg cell from your
70 year old grandmother, your clone may develop a case of arthritis or
alzheimers.  So be careful when cloning.  As a final note, here is a way to
control the outcome of your clone.  It is called pronuclear injection.!
  This involves injecting 200 to
 300 copies of the genes of your choice into the fertilized egg.  This way, you
can give your clone certain characteristics.  There is another way to manipulate
the genes while they are in the cell culture but I'm not going to touch on that
in here.

        You may encounter some problems while trying to clone something.  You must make
sure not to damage the egg cell or the donor cell.  Sometimes, embryos will just
not develop.  Some babies may be born dead.  In order for the mother to take in
an embryo, she must have the right balance of horomones and the embryo must be
in a certain stage of development.  If they are not synched up, the clone will
not develop.  Sometimes, the egg cell will not reprogram the DNA of the donor
cell.  

        So far, Nuclear Transfer has not been used to clone anything but mice, sheep,
and frogs.  While it is not known if they can use it to clone humans, it is
widely believed that the above procedure would produce a human clone.  But some
people argue that it is unethical to clone humans.  This is due to the fact that
cloning results in a lot of dead embryos which means a lot of dead babies.  This
discourages many scientists from attempting to clone humans.  And of course,
there are a bunch of laws that make it illegal. Currently, it is illegal to
clone humans in England and Norway.  In America, it is illegal to use Federal
funds for cloning humans.  In congress right now are several bills that would
outlaw cloning.  However, legislation has stalled so you can still legally clone
humans in the U.S.  In my own opinion, I think people should say the fuck with
ethics and go clone crazy.

Pigs (the animals)

Pigs like mud.  I think a pig would be a cool phone phreak because he could break into a can
or steal a payphone, and who's gonna stop him?  Who wants to touch a nasty pig?  With this
inspiration, I begin my quest to find a pig that could be trained to phreak.  First, I went to
my local animal ranch.  There were plenty of pigs, but they were all to big to fit in my car.  I
told Clayton, the overall sporting man selling the pigs, that I needed a smart pig.  He told me
that there were no smart pigs, and that if there were smart pigs he'd teach them how to make him
whiskey.  He proceded to walk back to his barn to get his shotgun, and unloaded two shells into
the air.  I took this hint and left, but not before stealing his mail.  I dind't know that
poor alcoholics could get a credit card.  So I went home, cried for a couple of hours, beat up
my neighbor for his lunch money, and cried some more.  Then I realized, "Hey, I saw Babe last
year.  Pigs talk in that movie!"  I think Clayton was wrong, so I called my crack dealer in
Hollywood to see if we could kidnap Babe.  He was pissed off because I was not buying any rock
from him, but I told him if he could get me a smart pig I'd buy plenty of it.  He said ok, and
two hours later my phone rang.  I thought it might be NASA (I stole a space ship), because the
big black van was parked outside of my house again, but my caller ID read "Anonymous Call" so I
figured it's not NASA.  It was Enrique, my smack dealer.  He told me that there were a lot of
smart pigs used to make Babe and that he was sending one my way.  I said thank you, hung up, and
went to sleep.  The next day, a cute 18 year old delivery girl brought my pig.  I asked her,
"Why don't you come inside my house and I can show you how to phreak?"  She got upset and slapped
me, so I figured she used AOL and called her a lamer.  When I got into my house, I opened the box
and my pig came out.  I decided I'd call him Babe, because that's what he's used to.  He decided
he had to go to the bathroom when I let him out.  I got mad, but figured he's gonna be dirty
anyway if he's gonna phreak for me.  I showed him a beige box and how to use it.  Then I decided
to show him my red box.  He ate it, but it's ok.  I heard that he can imitate the tones perfectly
with his snout.  We'll find out tomorrow, we're going to the mall to red box so I can call my
cousin in Arkansas.

SPEED, SPEED, SPEED!!!!!!
by Neptunium Overkill

INTRO:  Does your shiny new 56k modem still seem too slow? Sick of following the
FCC's 53k/s speed limit?  Want to download those big bad 100 MB+ warez files
without leaving your computer on all night?  Want big time bandwidth without
buying a T1?  Well, for most the answer is yes.  In the last few months, there
have been huge advanceses analog modem speed capabilities.  There are two simple
ways to do this, however you MIGHT have to shell out some cash.

METHOD #1 - SHOTGUN PROTOCOL:  This method uses one modem which combines the pow
er of two 56k modems.  The only one avalible at this time (8/3/98) is the
Diamond SupraSonic II, which is 56k Flex/V90 Compatible.  It uses two lines but
it detects incoming calls and when you receive one you can talk on your voice
line.  In other words, the only difference from that and using a single line
modem is that you won't be able to make calls while using the modem.  Many ISPs
support it and it will work with Win 95, 98, or NT.  The SupraSonic II fits in a
single ISA slot just as a normal modem would.  The main drawback with the
SupraSonic II is that it sells for $190.  If you have the cash, it's probably
the best way to go.  For more info check out: http://www.diamondmm.com/products/
current/sonic2.cfm

        Advantages:  - Compatible with many ISP's (for a list go to
http://www.diamondmm.com/shotgun/isp-list.html)
                               - Compatible with 3 operating systems
                               - Only uses 1 ISA Slot

     Disadvantages: - Costs $190
                               - Uses two phone lines

METHOD #2 - WINDOWS 98's M-PPP PROTOCOL:  This comes with Windows 98 and is not
avalible with any other operating system.  Windows 98 costs $90 but hell, you
can download it for free from any warez site.  Currently, more ISPs support
M-PPP than Shotgun, even my crappy little ISP has M-PPP support.  OK, basicly
what this does: Let's say i have a 56k modem in right now.  Then I add a 28.8k
modem in addition to the 56k.  The I decide to go all out and put in ANOTHER 56k
modem.  I would have 3 modems in my computer.  The cool thing about Win98 is
that you can combine the speed of numerous modems and use that speed under ONE
connection to the net.  In my case I would have a maximum speed of about 140k! 
That's pretty fuckin fast!!!!!  This can be quite inexpensive....Best Buy often
sells a 33.6 modem for $10 after rebate.  $30 gives you speed over 100k per
second.  Don't have any ISA slots left for extra modems?  PCI Modems are
avalible also, so call around, or, take out your Soundblaster and buy a PCI one
(about $30) and you've got it.
          
          Advantages: - Compatible with more ISP's than Shotgun
                                - Comes with Win98 which is avalible over the
internet for free
      Disadvantages: - Requires more than one ISA or PCI slot
                                - You have to buy more than one modem
