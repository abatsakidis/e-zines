                      The Cold Black Moon - by Gangsta



                            the cold black moon,
                             shall rise no more.
                     as souls shall die, this afternoon.
                      have i not done what i should do?
                       or, was i just a bumbling fool?
                    the hands of time shall tick no more.
                            the sky shall bleed,
                               as women weep.
                             Death with a smile,
                         shall come upon your side.
                   with grim white hands and cold embrace,
                   will hold you as your heart will race.
                    then you shall see the face of Death,
                  as slim fingers tighten around your neck.
                      and leave you laughin as a wreck.
                    there you will rest beneath the moon,
                     since you will die there very soon.
                      the birds of night begin to sing,
                    to praise their mighty, deadly king.
                     oh, what sadness shall i withstand,
                         looking down at where i am?

                  teardrops in my eyes...   - by Dr. Boffo




                            teardrops in my eyes
                          try to wash the pain away
                             nothing i can hide
                             would make you stay
                               no one i can be
                         could do much worse at this
                               trying to seek
                              a peaceful heart
                      and all the hatred that i wrecked
                           as my world falls apart
                               nothing i touch
                            and nothing i can see
                         is quite good enough for me
                             try to hide my eyes
                           with my trembling hands
                            more than i can take
                            more than i can stand
                             i wish i could fake
                             and make you smile
                           but i've gone too cold
                         and the darkness i've told
                        and the dreams that i killed
                          and my heart that i sold
                            and i lied to myself 
                          and i ripped myself whole
                             nothing i can make
                            or i could try to be
                         is quite good enough for me

                       look inside...  - by Dr. Boffo



                               look inside me
                                can you find
                             something to bring
                                peace of mind
                             nothing's real here
                               we're all fake
                               trying-too much
                           for me and mine to take
                               break inside me
                                 can you see
                               nothing within
                              that's real to me
                               sobbing softly
                                no one hears
                            pass right through me
                                i'm not here
                               call inside me
                                i'm not mine
                               try to outrace
                                paths of lies
                               nothing sacred
                               nothing's clear
                             i'm still screaming
                             but no one hears...

                       strange reality  - by Dr. Boffo




                  woke up this morning to a strange reality
                          all the things around me
                        weren't what they used to be
                   all around the world evil begins to bud
                   even total stranger hunger for my blood
                           hatred rules this world
                            it changes what we do
                                 it changes
                               all our actions
                             changes me and you
                           now i'm slowly murdered
                             murdered in my mind
                             no one really cares
                            no one's really kind
                      if they were they'd find---me....

                             The Stride of Death



                              By: The Poet VIP



                 As I stand here, in the middle of the sand,
                   I heard the cry go throughout the Land.
                   For non as brave have crossed my path,
                  For Fiends of night shall feel my wrath.
                   But at last I stand here, without hope,
                      For here they come with my rope.
                      A rope so long but yet too short,
                    I think, as feelings begin to hoard.
                       I see its time to pay my dues,
                    Too Bad they are just plain too few.

                  The evil within my soul shall never die,
                      I laugh this, as I see them hide.
                   See you may kill me, but are you safe?
                 For death will come with such sweet grace.
                       Without Mercy for good or bad,
                    I might just laugh, its just so Sad.
                      Yes Sad it is that non can hide,
                For Death comes here with such great stride.
                       Oh lover I shall soon be near,
                       For one as great shows no fear.

                Death is nothing more than what you make it,
                    You can choose it or try to fake it.
                     But for sake of argument here I go,
                        Oh yes this is just my soul.
                   From here on out I shall feel at peace,
                     For starting now I begin to cease.

                    evil hatred and death - by Dr. Boffo

                               im always here
                             the farther you run 
                          the more you should fear
                            nothing you can take
                            will hide you from me
                         i am your darkest nightmare
                             forbidden ectasies
                              hate me with all
                       your pathetic heart could bear
                              you tried to run
                              but i do not care
                            you keep coming back
                           in your twisted dreams
                        with razor nails i slice into
                       your splatter filled dreams....
