-----( welcome to kLUNK number 2 (belial)

        Hello, belial here... Yes that was a Anne Rice opening... And no,
I am not Lestat... Well, I got a few people who said kLUNK number one was
cool so I went ahead and did a second one... <G> I think that altogether
kLUNK number 2 is better then the first issue, but that is for you to
decide...

        If you would like to contribute to kLUNK, maybe an article or even
an ascii that I can use for the header then contact me on my board, Avalon,
at .908.739.4274. Any help would be greatly, I mean GREATLY appreciated...
Anyone who helps will be added to the member list for that issue... Also,
poems, and short stories and even top 10 lists are accepted... 

        The first article is called "Another Opinion of Porn" written by, 
Ace Lightning... Anyone who has been on godnet should know her... Anyway, 
this is an article in reply to my article in kLUNK number one called, "Our
Right to Porn". Its an excellent article and I thank Ace Lightning for
taking the time to reply to my article... 

        Well, so far all the response I've gotten has been positive, so
don't expect kLUNK to crumble and die anytime soon... I would also like
to specifically thank mindcrime of blade productions for all his great 
support... Now, read the rest of the textazine and get back to me with your 
opinions and comments...

until later...

-----( Article 1 ) "Another Opinion of Porn" by, Ace Lightning

Pornography is one of those issues that always provokes strong opinions. On 
the one hand, freedom of speech and expression is a basic principle of the 
Constitution. Who decides what to censor? And why stop at sexual content? 
Wouldn't the government just love to censor anyone who disagrees with them? 
Wouldn't one of the larger religious denominations just love to censor all 
other religions? Wouldn't your maiden aunt just love to censor the musicians 
in tight pants on MTV? Censorship in general is a Very Bad Idea.

I'm against censorship, but I'm also against pornography. We have to 
distinguish here between "pornography" and "erotica". Not everything that is 
sexually explicit is porn, in my opinion. Porn is dehumanizing. Porn presents 
an unrealistic view of human sexuality - men are all inexhaustible studs, 
women are all interchangeable sex toys. Porn leads men to believe that size 
is important, and to feel inadequate when they compare themselves to the 
improbably built porn heroes. In porn, rape is just another fun game, and 
"no" means "yes", and women secretly *enjoy* being treated abusively. Worst 
of all, there is no human interaction in porn... the only thing anybody seems 
to care about is instant sexual gratification. Erotica, on the other hand, is 
SEXY. Porn and erotica may both describe the same sexual activities in the 
same raw language; what distinguishes them is that an "erotic" work will be 
about individuals giving each other pleasure because they care about each 
other, while porn will simply focus on "cardboard" characters rubbing their 
genitalia together.

What's wrong with porn is that it dehumanizes sex... but this isn't 
justification for censorship. Perhaps if there were more erotica, there would 
be no need for porn.

-----( Article 3 ) "What makes a good sysop?" by, belial

        What makes a good sysop? There are a number of things. Like one of
the main things is dedication. A sysop should work to make their board good,
not just fart around and hope their board becomes good, they have to make
their board good. Hard work, a sysop has to work hard to have a good board,
not just do some things here and there, they have to constantly work on the
board, fix things, edit things, update things, etc... Leaving the board up
as much as possible is another point, a board that is down half the time 
isn't going to get very popular. The board needs to be up all the time. It
really annoys me to call a board that should be up and have my modem ring
for a hour. A good sysop should interact with his or her board, be a 
member of the board not just the sysop. A sysop should keep up with what
is going on in the board, make people enjoy the board. Try to get more 
people to call by offering different things. 

        Setting up a board right from the zip file doesn't mean that you
are a sysop. A sysop is someone who cares, someone has the time to run a 
board, someone who interacts with a board. Not someone who will only have
their board up when they feel like it. A sysop should have a good attitude
towards their board. All these things combined make a good sysop and a 
good board. So if you plan on starting up your own board take some of these
things into consideration. A board takes time and effort, no board becomes
popular overnight, except maybe prayer <G>, but the point of this article is
that you have to make your board popular, not set one up and hope that it 
does become popular without your time and effort. 

-----( article 4 ) "Back 2 skool! What 2 Expect!" by, blind fury

welp, i know, many people have written these little things before,
but this one is based on my own personal experience with my school.
lets see, i mind as well tell ya what school im dis'n, its pretty
much the whole Freehold Regional High School District. Many of the
teachers and the whole staff are very corrupt. Cursing for example
is forbidden by everyone in the building, but when a teacher curses,
the class thinks its cool, until that same teacher writes you up for
cursing! What's wrong with that picture? What i really hate is how no
one has any fucking balls to stand up to the school board! Not a 
single lawyer will defend you against the school district. When you
voice your opinion against the school or a single teacher, they take 
it as a very serious threat, suspend you pending a very lengthy 
evaluation with a bunch of shrinks, as well as a court hearing. (which
i might add that i have to go to on Sept. 12) So now its on my record
as being delinquent for voicing my right to freedom of speech. Oh, I
should remind you that in school, students have absolutely no rights
what so ever, that were givin to us by our fore-fathers when they 
wrote the US Constitution. Dress Codes? Freedom of Speech? Where the 
hell are the Civil Rights Board when you are in need of them? If 
President Clinton is so serious about improving the school system, WHY
THE HELL DOESN'T HE DO IT?! How long has he been president now? 3, almost 
4 years? Its getting damn close to the end of his term, and I haven't 
seen him do shit about the school system! What I think a lot of you don't
realize, is the fact that if you have a job, part-time, whatever, you are 
getting taxes taken out on that, Where is that money going? What about
your parents who, if they own their house, they are paying taxes on that
land, that go to fund the school system. If you are not happy with your 
school, do something about it! Voice your opinion! Act NOW! Thank you 
for your time.
