        Welcome to another action packed, kung-fu fighting issue of klunk. I
changed the format. Well, it is about time, the old one was, how could I say
it nice, ugly. Yes, I think that would fit. The old format was ugly so I
changed it around. It is not -totally- different, but I am pleased with the
new look.

        On to business. First things first. I lost my beloved internet
account. Yup, that means no more b3lial on #zines for a while. I am in the
great search for a job, so that I may once again join in on the wackiness
that is #zines. (and #conservative, gosh, what a cool channel) I wonder, do
you think there is an amazingly cool channel called #smurf? I'll have to
check that out when I get a new account.

        Well that is that, and this is this.

        I am sure a lot of you have seen the new 'zine out there called pork.
If not go get yourself a copy. I really enjoyed reading this 'zine. Misfit,
from some unknown ascii group going by the name, trank, really has something
going with this 'zine and as an elder of the 'zine scene, I would like to
personally wish him luck with it.

        Just a second. I'm no elder, what the hell am I thinking. I'm new to
all this. Well, good luck anyway misfit.

        There is a pretty new network out. Yup, and it is called y0lknet. I
know what you are saying 'y0lk, get out of here, I want no part' but wait. It
isn't too bad. There are 3 bases, and 1 member base. It is doing rather well
also. So if you run a 'zooney board and may be interested in hooking up with
it, call alderaan at 1-908-224-8780 and ask mindcrime about y0lknet. Tell him
I sent you. (avalon has it, why don't you?)

     - Don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are -
                                              - The Goo Goo Dolls

        What else is new eh?! Well for starters. I would like to see some
more people contribute to klunk. Yes, yes, I know. This isn't directed at
people who already have contributed to klunk. I would like to see some new
faces, some new talent. So, If you can write, please send something to me
here at klunk. I pretty much take anything. You want to write a poem, go
right ahead. You want to write a story, go right ahead. You want to write an
ansi scene article, go somewhere else. You want to write a porn txt, go
masturbate. I am looking for creative thinking and writing. I want original
stuff. So, don't do something that a million people have done before you.
Don't forget I am the editor, so I get to check spelling, grammar, and
everything else before I release your work, if I do. So if you want to spell
something odd on purpose be sure to leave me a note or something. Oh, and
don't write something like h3y j00 b0tcH f0r i00 l1n3z, cUz 3t hUr7z m3 3y3z
4ft3r 4 wH1l3!@

        One other thing. I really am in need of a good courier. Yes sir. Some
charismatic chap to spread klunk far and wide. Someone who has an internet
account. (and knows how to use it!) Someone who is popular, and who can get
on boards without any problems. All I would like this person to do is call
the nifty txt boards and upload klunk to them, and spread klunk throughout
the internet and irc. So if you are interested get in touch with me at either
avalon or alderaan.

        In the way of thanks this issue I have to thank Warlock(mud) for the
two fine poems, and Ajay, a local musician, for the excellent poem also. In
addition to that, I would like to thank my cousin Lucifer once again for a
terrific ascii, which has been placed in the klunk info file.

        I also would like to once again thank edicius for the poem he gave
me, called 'my generation'. This poem is one of my favorite poems, and I am
really glad he gave it to me to use for this issue.

        The first story I did is called "Answering America's Call". It is my
submission for a contest at our local vfw. The topic was "Answering America's
Call". I wrote it in the form of a story. Its kind of weird. When I got to
school, I looked at the other submissions from my class, and they were all
basically the same. I'm sure you have seen and maybe even done them. They
begin with the ever present 'We are America's future...' or 'We the young
people must make a difference...'. Mine is a bit different, but it still gets
my point across, we'll have to see if I win or not. I strongly doubt I will
win, but I felt like submitting this anyway.

        The second short story I did is called "A Hollow Victory". It is the
second part in a series of stories based on the infamous door game Legend of
the Red Dragon, by Seth Able Robinson. This story was originally going to be
released in the October Cripple Literature pak, but the pak never came out so
I am releasing it here in klunk. If you are interested in part one of this
series then find a copy of the September Cripple Literature pak. I have it
online at avalon if you can't find it anywhere else.

        Then we have the frog. I wrote this for nothing else, but fun. Its a
little tale, I'm sure you will like it.

        Don't forget to have a look at the new info file. Its has suffered
major revision. No more /´narkey info file. No, no. This is porn. True porn.
No childs play here. If your under 18, then you better not read this, it'll
blow you away for sure.

        Well, on with the issue. enjoy.

If you've been used,
if you've been bruised,
if you've been abused by your sin

Then, by all means, you must come in,
without the cares of kin

For these are my grounds,
lost but now found,
the place where cares are drowned

Open the door, turn the page,
and be not afraid of kid or cage

Experience my times, harder and worse,
poem to poem, and verse to verse

Life is not pretty, nor are its ways,
but within my world, you'll find no dismay

So come and don't fret, at least not yet,
for within my world there are no debts.

awoken,
to a horror filled world.
we are considered
to be the problem-
yet they,
with their suits and cars,
drop the bombs and kill.

and they wonder why
we want to be different.

we say,
that we are misunderstood.
yet we,
never tried to explain.
and they,
never tried to understand,
and look into our eyes,
and feel our pain.

and they wonder why
we want to be different.

drugs and violence,
created before us,
continued by us,
with feeble attempts at an end.
they created the weapon,
we're just using it.
but not anymore,
we've abused the weapon,
and now the war is in our hands.

and they wonder why
we want to be different.

burning fire,
raging storm,
out of control,
devouring at will.
no end in sight,
without work,
from two sparring sides.
they may not understand us,
now at least,
they may soon,
but not without work.

and they wonder why
we want to be different.

look into my eyes,
and see the burning curiosity.
look into my eyes,
and see my torn soul,
my mind being corrupted,
by your controlling ways.
get off of me,
or understand me--
then,
i will leave you alone.

        Ding, dong.

        "I'll get it." cried Jane.

        "Sure thing." replied John in the other room.

        Jane smoothly walked over to the front door, easily avoiding stepping
on the family cat, Lucky. Standing on her tippy toes, Jane peered out of the
peep hole. To her amazement, no one was there. Funny, she thought. I heard
the doorbell ring. I guess not.

        As she turned to walk back into the kitchen, where she was busy
cooking a batch of chocolate cookies, she thought she saw something in the
corner of her eye. Peering into the peep hole again revealed nothing. Or was
there something?

        Looking into the peep hole Jane began to see. First she saw the house
across the street. Its neatly trimmed edges and perfectly cut grass. She saw
the gaily colored siding and shutters. The clean windows and BMW car in the
drive way.

        Then her gaze shifted to the children, all happily playing tag in the
street. Their brightly colored clothes clinging to their young bodies. The
joyous smiles lighting their young faces.

        Up the road a little the ice cream man whistled down the street in
his little white van.

        All of this Jane saw through the peep hole. All of this, as she
answered the call, all of this, America. This land where she was born, this
land where she has lived her entire existence. Then she began to question.
What is all this? Why am I here? What purpose do I serve? The questions
flooded her head. Dazed, she walked back into the kitchen, absently tripping
over Lucky.

        Jane thought. Different emotions swelled inside her head.

        What is this, Just a mask. All that I have known. All that I have
loved. All of this, a lie, a deception. A ploy, a twist of my own secured
reality.

        A tear gently slid down her cheek, as she drifted off to sleep.

                                -+-----+-

        The next morning Jane woke up, her sour mood slightly lifting as the
smell of steaming hot coffee entered her head.

        At about noon the doorbell rang again. Gracefully Jane drifted up to
the door. Yet, when she saw the peep hole, she hesitated. The questions once
again intruding upon her weary mind.

        Blowing them away, Jane once again looked into the peep hole. Only
this time everything was different. Jane realized that the mask had been
removed.

        She saw the world for what it was. For better or for worse, absently
remembering the line from her wedding.

        There was no longer a house across the street. There was a 20 story
run down apartment building. There was no neatly trimmed grass, there were
bent and rusted garbage cans littering a crumbling sidewalk. Children. These
are not children. There are men and women. Broken. Dull eyed machines.
White, black, it didn't matter, they all melted into the same fold as the
rest.

        A hungry child wailed as an angstful mother vainly tried to shut his
cry, his voice!

        Oh god, this can't be happening, Jane thought. How is this. Turning
away Jane ran from the room. The questions pounded at her head. Her mind and
body bent. The realization so clear, so deceiving.

        This is my world, I made it. My shelter. I answer the call. I have no
voice. Not because I don't want to, because no one is listening. How can I
help? By not helping at all. This is my world, I made it so. I don't have to
answer. I'm not the one dying, I'm not the one starving. Oh, I can say I'm
helping, but who am I really helping. Mindless. When I fall, will you be
there to help me up?

        I can pretend all I want. With my fancy masquerade. It's all a joke
anyway. I have mine, who really cares about yours. I give no quarter, and you
in your foolish pride take none.

        It must end. Jane screamed, throwing the sweat soaked sheets from
her. This is America. I shall answer the call. I must not live and let live.
I have to make a difference. I can, this is my freedom.

        In the night Jane left her bed room and silently walked downstairs to
the front door. She didn't need any call this time. She looked into the hole
again. What did she expect. She had no clue. Her mind was already numb. Yet
looking into the hole she saw... nothing. It was blank.

        The slate had been wiped clean. She had been given a second chance.
Where else. America. The Land of Opportunity had given her new life. This
time, she thought, this time I shall have a voice, I shall make a difference.
I care. I will no longer be deceived by this. This is my world, this is my
chance. I may be one voice, one voice in a sea of noise, but I shall be
heard. This is America, this is my call.

        Tears welled in Jane's eyes as she turned around and began walking
back upstairs. A silent vow forming on her lips. As she got into bed, Jane
fell asleep. Her voice a weapon in her own brave new world.

- ---+-( "Shadows" by, Warlock )---------------------------------------+--- -

At one point I lived, but now I am dead,
for without a fate, there is no life lead

At one time, many had cared,
but now there are none with no love to share

The people around just make things worse,
showing how lonely I am to this verse

The shadows I live in,
Don't like other women,
And tend not to let me lay still

Although I may roam, I will not escape,
Until someone shines their light through this gape

My shadows surround, with no light in sight,
until I can find the woman of right...

- ---+-( "A Hollow Victory" by, belial )-------------------------------+--- -

        From his cave, deep within the forest, the red dragon stirred
restlessly, his dreams haunted by terrible visions: A sword being handed to
a warrior by a dying wizard. Darkness. A warrior's enraged battle cry, and
through the darkness a sword appears, its golden hilt and crystal blade.
White fire.

        The dragon screams a horrible shriek of fear and pain.

                                -=-=-=-

        "Aelfin, are you okay?"

        "Uh, yea, Brendan, I just thought I saw something, that's all. Let's
go; we have to be back." Aelfin replied.

        "Okay." Brendan said looking back.

        The two silently made their way back to the town, with Brendan
chancing an occasional look behind his back. Once they reached town they
immediately went to Turgon's Training Gym and made their daily report.

        "That's all you guys did today? Only kidding, good job. Har!" Barak
said after they made their report.

        "Thank you." Brendan and Aelfin both replied.

        "O.K., go clean up and get out of here." Barak said after a minute.

        As Aelfin and Brendan left Barak snorted and went back to cleaning
Master Turgon's muddy boots.

                                -=-=-=-

        Blindly Aelfin stumbled through the forest, his white shirt smeared
with blood and tears. Madness. A light, up ahead. Falling.  He screams, no
one hears. A face. Words. What does it say?

        "Thy test, Aelfin, has only begun. Thou must be brave and thou must
not falter. Thou can not fail..."

        "Fail what?!" Aelfin pleads, falling to his knees.

        "Can not fail..." the forest echoes.

        "Aelfin, Aelfin, you up?" asked Brendan, poking Aelfin and trying to
wipe the sleep from his eyes.

        "Uh, yeah." Aelfin replied.

        "Good. Why don't we get an early start?" Brendan said.

        "All right, I don't think I can get much more sleep anyway," replied
Aelfin after a few seconds.

        "Everything all right?"

        "Yeah, everything is fine. Why?"

        "I dunno, it just seems like something is wrong. If you're not
feeling well, you should really go to the healers' hut or something,"
Aelfin's friend replied, the concern showing on his face.

        "I'm fine. Don't worry about it. Shall we go?" Aelfin asked, packing
up his stuff.

        "All right, let's head a little deeper into the forest today. That
way we can pick up a little more experience fighting the bigger monsters."

        "O.K.," Aelfin said, "Sounds good to me."

        That day Aelfin and Brendan went deep into the forest, deeper than
usual. After being attacked about 10 times by some pretty nasty monsters,
they decided to call it a day and head back to town. As they reached town
they noticed that something was wrong. Everything was strangely quiet.

        "Hm, wonder what's wrong." Aelfin said aloud.

        "Dunno; let's take a ride in and see what's going on." Brendan said,
moving his horse ahead a little.

        After a second Aelfin followed his friend, his hand on the hilt of
his short sword. Then all of a sudden they heard something - cheers, coming
from the fields.

        "What can it be?" Aelfin asked.

        "It's coming from the fields; let's go take a look," Brendan said,
charging to where the noise was coming from.

        The fields were packed with people. Everyone in town must have been
there. In the middle of the crowd was a great fenced in circle and inside
there were two warriors fighting. After a few minutes, Aelfin and Brendan
noticed that the two warriors were not using wooden swords.

        "It's about time you two numskulls got here! I guess frolicking in
the forest is more important. Har!" Barak scolded when he saw Aelfin and
Brendan enter the crowd.

        "Sorry, we got hung up in the forest. What is this?" Aelfin asked.

        "This? This is a tournament. Watch, and maybe you two fools can
learn something," Barak replied.

        After about an hour the battle between the two warriors in the
fenced-in area was over. The loser lay in a pool of his own blood as the
winner was cheered by the crowd.

        "Disgusting." Brendan remarked.

        "Truly." Aelfin replied sickened by what he saw.

        "You! Yes, you there, with the horse. You're next!" the victorious
warrior yelled at Aelfin.

        "Here." Barak said, throwing a sword over to Aelfin, "Go kick his
ass. Har!"

        Aelfin held the sword in his hand, and the cheering died down and a
path was made leading to the ring. As Aelfin and Brendan made their way to
the ring the crowd started going wild again. The warrior just stood there
grinning. When they reached the ring, Aelfin shook hands with Brendan and
entered the ring.

        "So good of you to come." The warrior spat at Aelfin.

        Aelfin just stood there, his face showing no emotions.

        "Ah, I see. Get ready to die!" the warrior said, running at Aelfin
with his sword raised.

        Aelfin blocked the heavy blow, but was knocked to the ground. He
quickly got right back up avoiding a blow meant to take off his head. From
there the two warriors circled each other.

        "I can play your game, Sir Warrior, but can you handle defeat?"
Aelfin hissed at the warrior.

        "Defeat!" laughed the warrior, "Never!"

        Again the warrior rushed Aelfin, but this time Aelfin was ready and
easily blocked the warrior's charge. Again they circled. With a quick thrust
Aelfin nicked the warrior, sending a rush of blood down the  warrior's arm.
The crowd cheered, yet Aelfin heard nothing; his mind was totally fixed on
the battle.

        "You will pay for that, little boy!"

        Ignoring him, Aelfin once again thrust his sword at the warrior, but
was repelled by a quick parry. Quickly recovering, Aelfin made a backhand
thrust and slashed the warrior in the chest. As he looked into the warrior's
eyes, Aelfin no longer saw arrogance and pride, but a distinct look of fear.

        "Shall we end it?" demanded Aelfin.

        "Never!" cried the warrior, running at Aelfin.

        Aelfin dodged and brought his sword up, turned his head and pulled.
As Aelfin turned back around the crowd was silent. Lying on the ground at
Aelfin's feet was the crumpled form of the warrior, holding his entrails in
his hands. The look of fear in his eyes vanished as the look of death took
over.

        Shocked, Aelfin dropped his sword and looked to the crowd.  Then
Brendan entered the ring and softly escorted Aelfin away. As the two left,
the crowd began to cheer wildly. But the only reaction from Aelfin was one
of dread.

        Silently the frog stood on the burnt and crumbling log, his thoughts
lost in the past. He sat there and remembered. Remembered the days gone by,
and what it was to be young, for thirty years is an awfully long time for a
frog to live.

        He recalled the great Battle of Shady Pond, when a legion of rabbits
tried to drive the frogs away. He was young then, serving as Lt. General in
the frog army. He remembered the battle like it was yesterday.

        A phalanx of the fierce albino rabbits attacked their right flank.
It was a moment of sublime glory. The rabbits almost broke through, yet,
almost single handedly he fought them back until the reserve troops came to
their rescue.

        It was a nasty battle. The frogs were almost beat and they were
quickly losing moral. The rabbits controlled the southern and western edges
of the pond and were threatening to take the north. The frog army still had
firm control of the eastern shore of the pond, despite relentless attacks
from the maddened rabbit army. If help did not come soon the frog army would
be overwhelmed by the rabbits and Shady Pond would be lost.

        It was then that a young Lt. General with a unit of veteran frog
warriors broke the rabbit attack on the north side. A few minutes later a
unit of the elite corps of squirrel shadow warriors emerged from the trees,
attacking the rabbits on the western shore. It was a slaughter, the rabbit
line of defense was quickly broken and sent running south. What was left
of the northern resistance and the squirrel shadow warriors wheeled and went
running to the aid of the frogs defending the eastern shore, leaving a token
defense to defend the northern shore.

        This would be the most savage battle of the day. Both sides fought
fiercely, neither giving any quarter. The tide of the battle shifted like the
wind. It was impossible to tell who would win.

        Time after time the rabbits attacked, each time driven off by the
combined forces of squirrel and frog. In a frenzy, the rabbits launched one
final attack. They had almost broke through, yet once again in a risky move,
the Lt. General broke away with a small unit of warriors and halted the
rabbit advance.

        With a great war cry, the young Lt. General gathered warriors both
frog and squirrel about him and attacked the rabbits on their own front. They
plunged deep into the rabbit defense, splitting the rabbit army in two parts.
They fought on, no one was a match for the young Lt. General's courage. The
battle raged on. The battle field was littered with bodies, frog, squirrel,
and rabbit.

        Then the Lt. General found himself face to face with the rabbit
General. The Lt. General of the frog forces slipped into a berserker fit as
the other General attacked. It was a nasty battle, each one caught up in
their own blood lust. Finally, the brave Lt. General found an opening and
went for it. The other General realized his mistake, and tried to defend, but
he was to late, the Lt. General already delivered the killing blow.

        Seeing their General dead, the rabbit army knew the battle was lost.
What was left of their ranks turned and ran. The frog and squirrel armies
gave little chase, as the rabbits melted into the surrounding woods.

        When things quieted down, the frog and squirrel armies gave a great
cheer. They had won, the battle was over. The Lt. General was hailed as a
hero in the eyes of the squirrels and frogs. It was his moment to shine. Time
and again he proved his bravery that day. Without him the battle of Shady
Pond would have been lost, and the frogs would have been left without homes.

        However, that was a long, long time ago, the old frog pondered. Times
have changed a lot since then, since men came with their big houses, cars,
and shopping malls. The frog sighed, the memories always brought him pain. It
was a time long gone by... a small part of history, but a big part of his
life.

        TurkeyCon is coming up. Don't miss it.

        Wait!@ What is TurkeyCon, belial? Well, its pretty simple. All the
'zine people of the planet gather together in one place. Then we all throw
the bones and decide who cooks. Once that is decided those lucky few must
enter into the holy kitchen and cook up a marvelous feast. Then when the food
is ready, all the 'zine people must exit dos edit and have a seat at the
dining room table. The bones are cast once again and the servers are decided.
Once that is done, the servers set and put all the food on the table. Now
everyone has a seat. We pray to the c0w, and then begin our great feast of
turkey, mutton, stuffing, and other foods. We drink wine and listen to some
soothing music. Once we are all done eating and the servers clean the table,
we all partake in a Columbian Cigar and watch a good game of Doom, as we talk
about the good old times, when 1200 was fast.

        This year TurkeyCon is going to be held at Edicius's house. If you
need directions call 1-908-739-4274 and leave a message to edi.

        And no, evil mogel can not come this year.

        That about wraps it up. Have a nice day bucko!@
