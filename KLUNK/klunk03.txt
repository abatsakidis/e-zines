-----( welcome to kLUNK number 3 (belial)

        Its already kLUNK number 3. It seems like I just started on this 
little thing the other day. Wait, I did, nevermind. =! Anyway, things have
begun to slow down for me. The end of this summer was really kinda rapid.
Now that my board is finally up, I have plenty of time to work on certain
things, *coughlifecough* =) 

        So far, with kLUNK, I haven't gotten the amount of responce that I
thought I would. But, I appreciate the responce I have gotten. After you
read this issue of kLUNK do me a favor and call my new board avalon at 
908.739.4274, and tell me what you think of kLUNK, anything I can do to 
make it better. Tell me if it sux, whatever. I can't make it better if you
people don't tell me what is wrong or what you don't like or would like to
see changed. 

        The future of kLUNK. Well, I would like to expand into some different
areas of literature. I would like to add a part for letters to the editor, 
that's me =) I would like to heighten the quality of the articles and deal 
more in the events that are shaping our lives today. As fun and cool as what
we call 'the scene' is, we still have to remember what is going on around us, 
you know, like the O.J. Simpson trial. =) I would also like to see some 
poetry in kLUNK. 

        Once again I would like to thank Ace Lightning for another excellent
article. Well, enjoy kLUNK issue number 3 and remember to get back to me with 
your opinions. 

p.s. check out mindcrime's top 10 list. =) tis funny, number eight(8) almost
made me bust my liver!

-----( Article 1 ) "More Great Music" by, belial

        In Jonas 11, Edicius wrote a small article telling you some of the
best music that you can get. I agree, however, he forgot to mention a few
bands. So, I am going to take this time to list some of the bands that
edicius forgot. 

!@ any pink floyd ever made (including p.u.l.s.e)     
!@ silverchair, frogstomp
!@ journey, greatest hits
!@ tori amos, little earthquakes
!@ any jimi hendrix ever made 
!@ bush, everything zen
!@ coolio, gangsta's paradise (song)
     
        Jea, that says coolio. That song is the best rap song I ever heard,
and I am not a rap fan, still it is a great song. If you get any of these 
tapes and/or any of the ones edicius listed, and you will be just about set.
I'm sure as school goes by some new bands will be added to the list, but
for now you are fine with these. 

-----( Article 2 ) "Truth to Parents" by, belial

        Did you ever have your parents say stuff to you like "Get off the
computer." or "You're wasting your time with those stupid little games."? 
Well, I think the parents shouldn't be regarding the modem scene so lightly. 
In some cases the modem scene is more 'real' then the real world. 

        Yea right. Ok, sounds messed up. No. I ask you a few questions. 
Simple little questions. Ok, In the modem scene do you find racism? Eh?
What was that. No. I don't think so. Is sex of any concern? If you are
butt-stomping ugly, does anyone care? Speak up, was that a NO? Are there
wars? Is there any slavery? Do you have people hating other people because
of how they dress or look? No no no no no. 

        The modem world is a place for fun, where most people come to have
their enjoyment. The concerns of the 'real world' are left behind. So next
time your father or mother says "Get off the damn computer and go get a 
life!" or whatever they say, tell them, be like "Hey mom, I just met some
kid from China over the modem."

-----( Article 3 ) "The Craft of Witches" by, ace lightning

     Everybody knows what a Witch is. A Witch is an ugly old woman with 
green skin, a turned-up chin, and a wart on her nose; she wears a black 
dress and a pointy hat and rides a broomstick, and she casts spells on 
people by brewing up "eye of newt and toe of frog" in a big black cauldron. 
A Witch is an evil sorceress who gets her power from the Devil; she can't 
cry or fall in love, or she'll lose her powers. A Witch can do household 
chores and cause amusing chaos by wiggling her nose. Everybody knows what a 
Witch is, right?

     WRONG! I'm a Witch myself, and if I had a nickel for every time I had 
to explain *why* all those stereotypes are wrong, I'd be a rich Witch 
indeed. So, what is a "real" Witch like?

     To begin with, Witchcraft is a religion, also called Wicca (from an old 
English word meaning "wise one" or "one who changes things"). It is derived 
from the Pagan, pre-Christian religions of northwestern Europe, with many 
modern additions. Witches honor the forces of Nature as symbolized by a 
Goddess and God, who are co-equal in power. Their religious rites coincide 
with the changing seasons and the phases of the Moon. A group of Witches who 
worship together is called a coven (rhymes with "oven"); instead of a church 
or temple, they worship in a suitable outdoor location or a private home. 
The worship is usually led by a Priestess, sometimes with a Priest as well. 
They celebrate the Sun and Moon, the bounties of the Earth, the animals and 
plants who share this world with us, and all the joys of human nature as 
well. Although some Witches worship in the nude, this is not for the purpose 
of sexual orgies, but as one more way to insure that all participants are 
equal and totally free, and to make the point that every man and woman is an 
image of the God or Goddess.

     Witches do *NOT* worship the Christian Devil! (Why would we, when we're 
not Christians?) The confusion arose because the God is often depicted like 
the Greek god Pan, with horns or antlers on his head and the lower limbs of 
an animal. We do not mock Christian rituals by performing a backwards or 
"Black Mass", because we respect everyone's right to their own forms of 
worship (and hope that they will respect ours in return). Also, our Goddess 
and God never demand sacrifices, either human or animal; although death is 
viewed as part of the cycle of life, we do not approve of pointless and 
wasteful killing.

     Incidentally, a male Witch is not called a "warlock"; a male Witch 
is... a Witch. (What's a male Methodist called?) "Warlock" means 
"oathbreaker", and is a grave insult.

     What about casting spells on people? Well, magick (spelled that way to 
distinguish it from what David Copperfield does) *is* a part of Witchcraft, 
but it's very different from what you might find in stories or on TV. 
Witches can't throw fireballs or "zap" people, and we don't cast "spells" or 
"hexes" on people to turn them into frogs or make them fall in love with 
someone unsuitable. We use magick mainly for healing, prosperity, and 
protection, and never without the informed consent of the person(s) it will 
affect. And the closest thing to a "witches' brew" is likely to be a 
medicinal herbal tea.

     If you would like to learn more about the religion of Wicca, there are 
many books you can read. I recommend the following for basic information:

_The Spiral Dance_, by Starhawk
_To Ride A Silver Broomstick_, by Silver RavenWolf
_The Truth About Witchcraft Today_, by Scott Cunningham
_Drawing Down The Moon_, by Margot Adler

     You can also find Wiccan/Pagan/general occult discussion areas on the 
major online services and on many local BBS's. I leave you with the 
traditional Wiccan salutation... "Blessed Be!"

-----( Short Story 1 ) "Mr. Impossible" by, gannon

        I am Mr. Impossible.  I walk the foggy nights until my feet
blister and my toes bleed.  My shadowed eyes stare on, intently, as neither
rain, storm, sleet, or hail can stop me from my destination.  I'll walk 
through fires and wars without a glance.  I believe I am almost there, 
at least I feel that I am.  It happens every time.  My bones, old but strong,
can tell me when I'm close.  I press on.  Soon I can see the door, newly 
painted and reflecting the sun's rays upon me.  I don't even blink.  I reach
out, my gloved hand wrapping around the cold, steel knocker and hammering down
two successful times.  A child in the street behind me runs into his home 
in fear, leaving his toys scattered on the sidewalk, brightly colored with 
schoolboy chalk drawings.  I smile.  Within the interior I hear footsteps and 
retreat my hand into my cloak.  My finger wraps around the worn wood handle 
I have gotten so comfortably used to.  Centuries will do that to you.  The
door opens, and there stands a man.  His eyes open wide as he sees me, but
he makes no move, offensive or defensive.  I instinctivly know he is the one, 
my destination.  I pull out the wooden staff with the rusted sickle on the
end and slice through the morning air with swiftness and aim.  His head is 
on the ground before he stops breathing, and his body falls backwards, into 
the hallway.  Without a moments delay I turn around and walk down the brick 
path back to the street.  North I believe I am walking, my shadowed eyes 
staring on, intently, as I head for my destination.  I believe I am almost 
there, or at least I feel I am.  I can tell when I'm close.

-----( Poetry 1 ) "Live" by, gannon

Don't be a fool
and let life's enigmas
shape your existence.
Instead
take hold of the leash
that binds your spirit,
and release it...
turn it upwards,
outwards,
free.
Allow yourself to be,
talk to a stranger,
take a walk,
smile at the sun.
And when the darkness compels you
to the interior
light a candle,
read a book,
or sing to the moon.
Life is a collection of possibilities
and opportunities.
Take them by the horns
and hold on.

-----( Goodbye! (belial)

        wOw. I really thank gannon for those last two things. They were 
really good. If *YOU* would like to contribute to a textazine devoted to

        'contributions to kLUNK is what makes us all ereet' - unknown

        remember anything is acceptable except stuff that says the word 
"FUCK" as everyother word. I encountered this on a board the other day and
it really pissed me off, so the word "FUCK" will not appear in kLUNK unless
it is totally necessary. 

        Well, kLUNK four shold be out soon enough so don't eat, sleep, 
wash yourself, masturbate, or brush yer big buck teef until it comes out! =)
Only kidding, don't do that, unless you really want to but I see no reason
on earth for you to, unless if your blind and you can't read kLUNK, which
would really suck, but then again if you were blind you probably wouldn't
have read that because like the computer screen isn't in brail. nevermind, 
see ya laterz...
