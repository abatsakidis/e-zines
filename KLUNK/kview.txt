        This program is guaranteed to do nothing. If it fucks up your 
computer in anyway, I will be shocked. Christ, its only a little batch file. 
Anyway, if it does anything to your computer fuck off, its not my problem. 
I'm not responsible, you are. I disclaim nothing. Use at your own risk.

will have this minor little bug fixed tho.
