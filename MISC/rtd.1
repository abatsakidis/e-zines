Welcome To Rajasthan....

Rajasthan -Rajputana of old.Land of people who are brave and chivalrous,
people with warlike lifestyle around whom grew the most amazing legends
of romance and heroism.There is a certain magic about travelling through
Rajasthan which is unequalled by any other place in the world.It is a land
of superlatives...everything here is breathtakingly beautiful,impressive
and fascinating.It is packed with history,art and culture taht goes back
several centuries.

Rajasthan-where the mood and rythem is so overpowering that it impresses
even the most seasoned traveller.It has rightly been called a huge open
air museum where the relics of a golden past have been carefully preserved
for the benefit of the tourist.

It is well connected with other parts of the country and can be easily
approached from Delhi & Bombay.Rajasthan is a land where the past still
lives on-and it is glorious past ,too.It is for this great land that
Col. James Todd has written,"Rajasthan exhibits the sole example in the
history of mankind of a people withstanding every outrage barbarity can
inflict or human nature sustain,and bent to the earth,yet rising buoyant
from the pressure and making calamity a whetstone to courage.

The annals of Rajasthan present golden examples of countless deeds of valour
and selfless sacrifice.A visit to this wonderland will leave a lasting spell
on your mind.
