				DNS SPOOFING
				------------

hi-to: johan... who originaly developed the method and helped others and
       basically made my lame article possible :)

introduction - 
               ill get this out in the open: I CAN NOT WRITE
               welp people bug me about how to do this or that alot or bug
me to write articles => so i finially am. this is only intended to give a
brief outline on one of the methods of dns spoofing. anyways aparently this
is the only zine around that would print my garbage. ;)

background -
             not going too in depth here. the people who care to
understand will, but id guess most people just want to sP0oF! anyways DNS
stands for domain name server allthough you may hear it refered to as
dynamic name server. dns servers are what allow us to use non numeric
addresses. basically a dns server is a computer which is running
a nameserver daemon typically listening on udp port 53. typically when a
new domain is setup the domain is registered with internic. internic tells
its clients who has authority over the domains registered with it.  for
example say 1.2.3.4 wanted to resolve thhe adrs for taco.com and 1.2.3.4's
nameserver was 1.3.3.7. 1.2.3.4 would ask 1.3.3.7 what the ip adrs for
taco.com was, 1.3.3.7 would ask internic who had authoridy over taco.com
and internic might tell it ns.taco.com. then 1.3.3.7 would ask
ns.taco.com what the ip adrs for taco.com was. ns.naco.com would tell
1.3.3.7 that the ip adrs for taco.com was 4.3.2.1 and then 1.3.3.7 would
tell 1.2.3.4 that the adrs for taco.com is 4.3.2.1 and the adrs would thus
be resolved.

the sploit -
             named generally caches addresses that are looked up by its
clients. if 1.2.3.4 were to ask 1.3.3.7 what the adrs for taco.com was
again, 1.3.3.7 would not ask anyone else it would merely say that the
address for taco.com is 4.3.2.1. the funny part is named dosnt do alot
of checking when another nameserver replies to its query. it basically
just tells the client what is was told and caches the same. this is why we
can spoof.

what we do - 
             lets say were sitting on ns.taco.com and we have authoraty
for all of taco.com. we want to cache our boxs adrs 2.2.2.2 on the remote
nameserver ns.burrito.com so that we can connect to burrito.com with the
adrs of trusted.buritto.com. we could write a program that listens for dns
queries and replies with false information. sitting on ns.taco.com we could
lookup taco.com on the nameserver ns.burrito.com. ns.burrito.com would ask
internic who had authority for taco.com and it would tell ns.burrito.com
that ns.taco.com had authority over taco.com. then ns.burrito.com would
ask ns.taco.com what the address for taco.com was. if we were running a
normal named it would merely tell ns.burrito.com that the adrs for
taco.com was 4.3.2.1. but we arent. well say that ns.taco.com tells
ns.burrito.com that the reverse of 2.2.2.2 is trusted.taco.com and the
adrs for trusted.taco.com is 2.2.2.2. this exploits the failure to check a
few things in named. basically ns.burrito.com asked what the adrs for
taco.com was and we told it that the reverse of 2.2.2.2 is
trusted.burrito.com and that the adrs for trusted.burrito.com is 2.2.2.2.
they asked a question to which we responded with two awnsers to different
question entirely. now we would simply connect to burrito.com from 2.2.2.2 
and burrito.com would ask ns.burrito.com for the reverse of 2.2.2.2 and in
its cache it would find trusted.burrito.com and it would reply with that.
then it would ask for the adrs of trusted.burrito.com and it would reply
with 2.2.2.2. you would then be connected to burrito.com from  
trusted.burrito.com and in effect dns spoofing. neato haw?

conclusion -
             welp i hope this explained the general concept as it was not
intended to exlpain anything more. hey, im a bad writer and im lazy. the
examples used above are completely bullshit but they make you think about
the role tacos play in your life. welp i love you. bye.

				PSN HACKING

           The world of the New York Packet Switched Network Raw Pad
                          brought to you by peedee
                               peedee@el8.org
                                   5-16-97

        First off, this whole thing will prolly take only one paragraph
so I'll just dig into it right away.  When you connect to the New York
Packet Switched Network, you will see a CONNECT/2400 then the screen
will go black and stay that way until you enter HH.

Now, that you've connected and entered HH you will see the following:

            WELCOME TO NEW YORKS PACKET SWITCHING SERVICE
*

* is the psn's prompt, thats the way for the psn to tell you to enter
a nua.  A nua is a network user address, its very similar to a telephone
number, in that it is 10 digits long, when you type in 7185551212 for
example, you will be connected to informations computers in the 718
npa instead of getting a voiceline, now, if you want to find some switchs
to hack, your going to have to scan every number in different New York
area codes.

Comments: Use of a real New York psn aided me in writing this article.

		            SOCIAL ENGINEERING
			    ------------------

		   Social engineering for fun and profit


	Social Engineering, whats involved?:
When you social engineer, you try to become someone your not, in this
case, we are going to pretend we are bell employee's or confused
customers. Bell employee's you will get more..
	
	Why you social engineer?:
How do you think all those nice mutant ninja sw1tch bunny's, as halflife
calls them, get all there fancy k0dez, and fuck over pple's phones?
They social engineer th3m usually..unless there gay like D-FENZ they whip
out TONE-L0C and go nutz..

	What's going to be explained here?:
Social engineering your RBOC for one..Why would you want to do this you
ask? To get the # for the RC/MAC, duh..What can you do at the RC/MAC? Get
switch dialup #'s, login and passwords, k-fresh k0dez, new and line change
service orders, like, adding 3-way or call waiting onto your phone, or
forwarding your enemy's lines to guam.

	Ok gerlz, lets start with the rc/mac..RC/MAC, its where itz at.
First of all, don't get cocky, because they will trace you and send Bell
Security or something after you to whip the shit out of you. If you have
an attitude pr0blem why dont u call from a payphone or do what d-fens
doez, WHIP OUT THE BEIGE B0X..or from a pbx or something..calling example
612-555-1212 (Information).

Now, your going to want to call the operator, and get the emergency repair
# for ur telco company, in my case, USWest, once you call that a lady or
whatever will answer announcing here department, to make it clear to her
that you have called the wrong # ask her what department you have reached,
then tell her, oh, I have a private line circuit that is down, do you have
the # for the IC Repair center? she will give you the #..call that, again,
you will be announced the department #, say, Oh, eye am sorry, this is
b1ll over at the frame of Minneapolis013, could you transfer me to MLAC or
the LDMC? Oh, and give me the #'s too so I dont have to go through this
again..if they are confused, just be straight forward and ask her for the
# for the RC/MAC, that you have a frustraited customer here that need's
some line change orders. Once you have that #, call it..

Now, when you finally get your RC/MAC # you can move on to the fun part

	Getting Un-listed phone #'s..
Call the RC/MAC, again, say this is b1ll from the frame at
minneapolis-013, I need you to go into FAC's and pull "612-555-1212"
They will ask you waht you need or somethign gimpy..Ask them if they can
pull the address and binding post information..they will give you the shit
and from what i've been told several hyphinated #'s, which represent where
the pairs reside in the terminal box or something..
Then ask them if they have SORD..if they do, ask them to pull the
subscriber name, they will tell you it, be polite and tell them to fuck
off or something and hang up.. 

	Getting new or exisiting line service orders:
Call the RC/MAC, again, do the b1ll at customer service, i have a
frustrated customer here who put in a line change order the other day, the
order went through but i guess it wasn't processed..I need you to add
3-way calling to "612-555-1212", they will then ask you for a service
order # or something
make up 10 numbers, put a c in front of it like..this

"Ah yes, here it is, it is:"
"c-123-456-789-1", they will say, hrmm..its not in the system
<You> Oh, its not? well could you do it anyways im getting a lot of heat
from my supervisor in getting this done..they will either put it thru, or
ask for your supervisor to call in to verify or something..75% of the time
it will go through..

	Getting Switch Room number's: (NOTE: most likely you will not be
given the dialups, but instead the voice #'s for the guys who sit at the
SCC/MCC consoles in the switch room or whatever..blah, you can however
social engineer them for the #'s..RC/MAC will most likely have it and not
want to give it out, but I imagine they might have some
login/password's..if not your going to have to get it from the janitor at
the switch or wahtever..;) )
Anyways..call the RC/MAC up, say "Hi, this is b1ll over in translations,
i've misplaced my listing and informational packet with vital switch
information for Minneapolis013, I need the dialup # for the switch for so
and so city, they may say they dont have it, but they have #'s for
others..and say..ill tell you what, why dont you read off those 3#'s for
me and ill try and get some information from them about the switch # that
I do want, call you back and give it to you, incase you need it for the
same reason..kinda save you some time know what I mean? He will read them
off, and you say, fuck you or whatever, have a nice day, etc etc..If
you've gotten this far, you should be able to figure the rest out...

			HAVE A NICE FUCKING LIFE

			    ------------------

	H1gh!%!@$ 
	
Erik Bloodaxe, el8's favorite burnout!
The cocaine snorting looser who was booted from LOD and PHRACK cuz he was
a fucking moron. Arrested and raided for hacking emergency services we
give this burnout two thumbs up! 

Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600, a natural born, looser.
The balding misleading son of a bitch just can't get enough of redbox's
and the phf bug! He insists on printing at least one article on each and
every issue, even tho phf and redboxing are both 235234234 years old, 
Mr. Goldstein doesn't think so!

Phiber Optik, Mr. Goldstein's butt buddy!
Mr. Optik, an unforunate foe, also hauled off to jail at an early age,
Not only was he a nark, he also ran a former hacking group MOD,
Masters of DOS! er..Deception. Out of jail now, he spends his freetime
with Emmanuel doing a really lame talk show like thing. Call in and
tell him your thoughts%!$!$

Voy, Er1kb'z personal monkey boy!
If this saucy fuck was an ice cream flavor he'd be praleins and dick. 
A GENUINE burnout and he is catching up closely in his mentor's footsteps!
Old fat, and probally bald by now, he is also an editor of phrack!

			       SENDMAIL
		               --------

		The lame ass 8.8.4 remote "problem" in 

		Berkley's latest sendmail screw up.
				-by Plurbius Monk
				plurbius@el8.org

After many hours looking at the code and trying to reproduce the reported
exploit in 8.8.4, I still don't see it as possible.  It was possible in 8.8.3,
but 8.8.4 fixed this.

If anyone is able to reproduce this problem with 8.8.4, please send me the
output of doing the exploit as follows:

/usr/lib/sendmail -d44.5 -bs

This will emulate the SMTP conversation so you can use the posted exploit.
You can also try:

/usr/lib/sendmail -d44.5 -f nonexistentuser nonexistentuser < /dev/null
which will avoid the need to go through the SMTP conversation.

I currently have the "remote exploit" for sendmail 8.8.4 but have not
been successful even on a virgin Linux box with this version of
sendmail installed.

People using 8.8.5 can also try to reproduce it since there weren't any
changes from 8.8.4 to 8.8.5 which would have fixed this problem except 8.8.5
doesn't save to dead.letter the way the exploit shows.  You can still get a
save to dead-letter in 8.8.5 by removing the postmaster alias and rebuilding
your alias database before trying the commands above.

I would really like to hear from someone who can do this so I can be sure a
fix gets into 8.8.6.
