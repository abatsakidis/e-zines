-> How Corporate Power Continually Fucks Uninhibited Technology
  What happens in the 'states' when new technology comes in from places
  like europe or japan or new techniques are developed within? Simple,
  the fcc and other fucking nasty organizations that think they should
  have the power over something intangible step in and fuck everyone
  including themselves! Organizations institute standards and protocols
  for illicit control that subsides the engineers feeble will into
  submission. After that the general population is left feeling helpless
  since obviously the scientists and engineers are smart and must know
  best. Get a fucking life! The purpose of a corporation is to make
  money. If it improves a certain technology there is profit motive
  behind it. If they could make money by slicing all of our collective
  throats they would. The only reason we do see change in technology and
  'better technology' is because of competition among those
  corporations. Competition is definitely not a good thing but the point
  is that when we allow profit motives to rule over technology it
  becomes just a tool to make money rather than advance ourselves.

-> No Justification Necessary
  It's funny how a somewhat shy person will not say a word in real life
  but put them on the internet and they will spend hours lambasting the
  slightest detail of a program, news story, or even a simple
  conversation. This might be due to the highly analytical minds that
  compromise the majority of internet dwellers, but that is besides the
  point. All of this type of dialogue is good but what few people
  realize is the 
   * detrimental effects of it.... when you actively try to destroy
     someone else's visions and ideals without a) knowing what they are
     and b) not having your own intentions lined out about the said
     topic you do more harm than good by trying to be the devil's
     advocate
   * if your an anarchist why destroy your plan at one person's warning?
     Why listen to someone else when you already have your thoughts
     straightened out? Why bend over to someone you don't even know? You
     never sat down with these people and had a cup of coffee or smoked
     a joint with them. (not saying you have to to understand them) You
     can talk shit about capitalism day in and day out but you will bow
     down at the slightest negativity from an online board??
  There is no justification necessary for what you say. You said it--you
  meant it didn't you? You don't have to justify yourself to someone
  else because you don't respect authority do you? Do you? You've proved
  it to yourself--what the problem is, is that you haven't gotten your
  point across to those other people. That is where you went wrong--not
  your premiss! So stand up, spit in their eye and proclaim the good
  news from the mountain.

-> Be a Bitch or a Slave-Master
   So there you have it. In the areas afflicted with capitalism those
   are your survival choices. You can either work under someone to pay
   for food, shelter, toys, etc. or you can be a fucking master nazi
   demanding others do your bidding so you can reap their awards from
   them. Either way if you believe in hell that's where you are ending
   up when you die because your a motherfucking asshole to either
   yourself or others. Or is there another alternate way that is just
   being obscured from you like the golden orange at the top of the
   tree? You can not see it because the rest of the oranges block it's
   view. No one tells you about it because they are too busy fighting
   over the ones underneath it. The ones who have found the top orange
   refuse to come back down and enter the death and decay that exists.
   It is up to you to seek the fruits of freedom. I can not give it to
   you. This zine can not give it to you. The world will not give it to
   you. You can not buy it with money. You can not win it with
   popularity. You can not have it represented by votes. You can not
   force it with militaries and wars. You can not petition a god for
   redemption to it. You can not make books change their stories to
   life. The choice is yours in your life. You can be a bitch and
   submit. You can be a slave-master and have others submit. Or, you can
   rejoice that everyone is a free soul and can do what they wish
   regardless of anyone else. I urge and implore you to have for
   yourself what is rightfully yours--your freedom!

%%%%fucking shit up on a military base%%%%%%%%
If you ever want to recon a military base, or if you have other devious
intentions wear a PT uniform. The physical training uniform has no rank
insignia on it therefore you can't get harassed as easily. Hair should
be at least off the ears and a moustache is only acceptable if you are
done with training. Usually a flat top is a good idea. The back of your
hair should be blocked or tapered. No fucking ragtails. For females only
halfway down the neck may the hair go down. Different hats and the hair
supposedly signifies different sex.
A note on composure...You will be sighted right out if you walk like you
haven't a care in the world or if you are twitching like a tweaking
bastard. Keep your shoulders straight and back. Keep your stride the
same at all times. Keep your head up and stay attentive at all times.
Don't swing your arms too much and walk on approved walking spaces with
a determined stride/look.
So what CAN you do on a military base? It's not like you can shoot up
the place without signing your own death warrant. It would take cunning
to run out with anything that is worth something without some detailed
planning but why is that stopping you? Think motherfucker! How about
setting up a timed explosive to blow those motherfuckers up? Fuck anyone
that lives on an american base! They all deserve death for they are not
alive right now! Let's do a walkthrough shall we?
Since the army and I assume other 'services' don't sleep with their
weapons anymore all that shit is locked up in the armory which is under
the control of the quartermaster but usually some shitless sergeant has
the lock and key because why not have a bitch do it for you? There are
literally thousands of ways of fucking shit up as any true kid has
always inevitably found out. My favorite, the m.o., happens to be what
EF! did to the Veil ski slope. Their time bomb was made out of one of
those kitchen timers that you turn--like a watch. On one side was taped
half the circuit which of course had some batteries attatched to it.
Then a paperclip connecting the other side of the circuit was attatched
to the middle of the timer. When it clicked around it would connect at
the designated time and then ka-fucking-BOOM!

So the next question is how the fuck do you hide such a device for
enough time for you to get the fuck out, uncaught, unharmed? Well, you
could take some of those 50 gallon trash cans that you find lying all
over the place and turn them upside down. But, before you do that why
don't you fill it up with some shrapnel first like rocks, nails, and
knives you can steal from safeway or something. But we still haven't
tackled how you are going to do all this shit without being noticed and
probably stopped. One method that seems to work well is having two
identities. One, would be the pt gi lieutenant out and about doing some
morning exercises. This would be to get in and out of the base. The next
would be to change clothes to a civilian contractor uniform and pretend
your doing some measurements for a new building or something. You can
find those kickass laser light tripod scales at any decent engineering
school. You know the ones with the hp calculators that allow you to
determine what grade the ground should be. Come on--if you are going to
blow up a goddamn section of a military base you should work this shit
out mon. It would be extremely wise to recruit at least another friend
with you so it's not as suspcious and two heads are better than one. If
nothing else he could act as a lookout. Also, if you are blowing up a
part of a military base if you get caught you will probably be put to
death so after the dirty deed is done do not hesitate to do whatever it
takes to get the fuck out of the country fast. Take chances and do what
your heart/brain thinks is right. Know that thousands, neh, millions of
us stand in solidarity with any action you will take against the state!

-> The 'Computer Revolution' isn't Here Yet
   Most people believe that back in the 80's was when computers start
   seeping into the homes of people. Then of course an epoch was reached
   with the advent of the web in 93. Later on again in 98 was when
   computer usage starting becoming an 'ordinary thing'. A lot of people
   said that after the so-called dot-com burst the computer revolution
   had done it's part and now we are networked to stay. To put mildly,
   as one can get trying to exact venom from a snake, the revolution
   has not come and won't come for quite a while because as we now
   know--it's not a climatical event and it sure as hell isn't a single
   isolated one either. But, that doesn't stop us, the dreamers of
   dreams, the lovers of love, and the hackers of hack from doing our
   best to bring on the real computer revolution. This means throwing
   out everything that we have been caught up in believing and doing
   what we believe is right which most commonly that which is fun or
   enlightening. We must quit our jobs now! We must stop relying on
   money and other inhibitors of free will. We must disregard all the
   rules, laws, and regulations that stop us from achieving that which
   is true. Stop hacking by yourselves and at the next lan party turn it
   into an all out hacking extravaganza. Write some propaganda to
   encourage others. Set a date and name a place for a three day or week
   or month long free hacker con. Hack! Hack! Hack! After the con get
   everyone you can together--fuck that!--get everyone together to stay
   together and get on the road and start hacking everything into life.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$NEWS FLASH$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The AHAS collective working out of missouri is organizing a free
autonomous hacker gathering somewhere in the Mark Twain National Forest
for the month of June--or as long as we can stay without getting
extracted by the pheds. Free food will be provided daily by various free
kitchens. Feel free to setup your own, though, as we are all in this
together. We will be having a biodiesel power generator workshop the
first week to get as much power as we can. Other people are dragging
solar panels out. We plan to have bands and djs playing music as much as
they can before they pass out. You don't need to rsvp with us--just show
up June 1st or even before! We are implementing a 802.11g network with
ipv6, although undoubtedly there will be many many networks and
computers overfilling the tents and spaces between. We have procured
several large army tents but will need many more sunshaded spots and are
wondering what the fuck to do about heat dissipation. This is an open
event and we are asking everyone NOT to sign any permit that any
national forest person would give you. You have the 'legal' right to
stay at the spot for seventy some odd days. Bring your hts, laptops,
routers, switches, antennae, sleeping bags, tents, anything that you
might need/want or someone else might. Remember, we are all about
sharing and communalizing so please do not hesitate. Exact directions
will be provided later on this year closer to May. If you want more
information the St. Louis 2600 meetings have various members involved in
the missouri AHAS collective.

In other news we have received word about another AHAS collective out of
california organizing a similiar event for the month of September. This
is fucking cool and we encourage everyone to attend it as well! They
don't have any more details as of yet but do have a temp. website up and
supposedly meet at the San Francisco and San Diego 2600 meetings.

-> Real Motha'Fuk'n Hackaz   
   I'm really sick and tired of reading about 'hackers' who have found
   the next buffer overflow in a program that was written by a
   non-hacker. We will always have fucking buffer overflows until the
   day when hackers are the only coders. Fuck 'society'--we don't
   fucking need them--they need us! So, stop playing to their bullshit
   and start hacking your way to nirvana! Real motherfucking hackers are
   ninjas through the night trashing phone offices, burning down
   computer stores. Real hackers don't buy old equipment at computer
   trade shows--they steal it! Real hackers turn payphones into free
   phones and then map them out and advertise them on the net. Real
   hackers don't look for documentation on the net to a problem. Real
   hackers have the answer before they have the question. Real hackers
   don't use old software to accomplish their purposes. They hack it
   into being. Real hackers don't label themselves as such. Real hackers
   reject classifications and labels. Real hackers don't worry about
   primaries and elections. After all, real hackers can hack said
   elections if they gave a shit about them in the first place--which
   they don't. Real hackers play games--but not the ones you are
   thinking of. Real hackers play games as their life and their life as
   a game. Real hackers know that to lose is to die. Real hackers can
   come back to life but recognize that it is much easier to stay alive
   in the first place.
