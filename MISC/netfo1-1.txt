 stay up too late, so now i can focus on something at these times.  this is
 net-fo.  cute huh?

 "yeah, funny. ha ha.  where did i see this style of quoting the reader b4?"

 i dunno. =]  anyhoot.  i'll be focusing on neet stuff that can be found on
 the internet.  and a monthly plug for a good bbs.  have fun.  and if
 you actually want to help out with this peice of shit, git in touch with me
 on #zines or via email @ jwapienn@pla-net.net.  simple, eh?  i'll accept
