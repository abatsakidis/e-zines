Well there just isn't that many t-filez out there from downunder out
there so here it is. The first edition of what will hopefully become
a regular newsletter.

...and now for a story, an insight into the little joys in life

	Every anarchist feels the urge to get things for less. Or free.
And maybe a good chase or two while running from pursuers....
Well anyway I am a firm believer in lifes little discounts and one that
can come quite handy is the regular rubbish collection nights. Sunday night,
shit all on the box so what else to do, right? So i chucked on the gloves,
got my RATM cd and maglite and headed out into the darkness. Amid a few
weird glances from passers by (hey doesnt everyone go out at 11pm to look
for rubbish?) the night turned out into a success. A VCR,computer tower 
case,
various chemicals that can be put to #good# use,etc.But who gives a 
shit,right?
Well the reason I am writing this is just something that struck me while I 
was
out there (not a car). Every so often you can really feel at peace with 
yourself
and who you are. For me it is usually when I am out in the middle of nowhere
hiking . Just times where you can relax without
having to act like someone, be like someone, conform. Strangest thing
for me was that I got the same feeling from riding around at 11pm. Rage's 
lyrics
pumpin out (another good one to pass the time is the Matrix soundtrack), and 
riding
through the blackness. Could have rode all night prob if it wasnt for the 
maglite
batteries. It just hit me. Of all the times that you feel bliss with life, 
it can
even come when im doin shit like that. Or maybe I should have got more than 
8 hrs sleep
this weekend?

....for the future
May be a while before I post this shit but these are some current projects. 
have a website
with pics soon. just email me at ozcam83@hotmail.com if you have any 
questions at all
about these projects or if you live in australia and are into the general 
h/p/v/a/c scene.
-Gain access to an entire MET train (only for ppl in oz) with one home made 
key
-HMV Music Security (How to beat it)
-Homemade ESTES Rocket Launcher
-Landmines,infra red switches for detonators
*The general aim of my files-to be a no bullshit resource of original shit 
that works without
blowing your head off.
