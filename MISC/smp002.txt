"one day, i ate a cow"

                  man did it taste bad.

	I weave words 
	to stimulate your eyes
	and touch your heart.
	I use colours
	to create what i see,
	when i look at your world.

    Tonight,
    I feel i have the power
    To make our worlds coincide.
	
	And tomorrow you will say to me,
"last night you had this crazy look in your eye."
	And then you will tell me 
	you gave me a glass of wine
	and put me to bed...
   When really,
i was up all night
thinking of a way,
we could peacefully
share the soap in the shower.

      "Crickets"

The crickets chirp and I listen
Noises of night, the stars glisten
Cars intrude the essence of silence
Sounds of chaos, Sounds of violence
Languages speak, to me they are heard
Foreign they are, not making a word
Breathing the air we all contract
Grasping the peace, we all have lacked
The crickets chirp and people ignore
The sounds of nature which i adore

         Primo shoes=Mucho profit: A buisness lesson for the 90's?  -Nybar

                                 Lesson 2: Coupon Fraud
                            You know those things in grocery stores that
                            automatically give out free coupons? You can only
                            get two out at first.. but eventually they come
                            back. If you run through a big grocery store.. the
                            ones that have run out will have re-loaded by the
                            time you get back to them. Then.. wait until you
                            get a clerk that looks kind of wet behind the ears.
                            Give this clerk the coupons and the stuff they are
                            for and you can get FREE stuff. YEAH!

	If there was a way
	      I would teach the world of existence and survival.
	If there was a way,
	       he would take over the world
	       and pound his every belief into their palpable skulls.
	If there was a way,
                            HE would be my first student.

Note from the editor: I have had some compliments and some complaints
about my new zine. I just want to take a few lines to explain something. I
am new here in the 'zineworld' and I am having a lot of fun doing this.
But i just want to clear up the suspicions that I think I am anywhere as
talented as Mogel and the other _infamous_ zine authors. I am here to have
fun and share my poetry, not to beat anyone or try and outdo anyone else.
I hope you all enjoy this issue and feel free to send anything you would
like to see in issue #3.  Some poeple will enjoy reading it and others
will delete the file. Whatever the case is, this was the fucking second
issue and pass it on damnit!!!!
