Update on Australian Government regulation of online services
--------------------------------------------------------------

   Australia's Federal Government wants to introduce laws that will regulate
everyday use of the Internet and other online services.
   Thanks to member contributions, EFA and a number of other groups have
submitted detailed responses opposing a government document entitled
"Consultation Paper on the Regulation of On-line Information Services", made
available on the World Wide Web at <http://www.dca.gov.au/paper_2.html>.
EFA's message to the government has been posted in relevant online
discussion forums.
   Further details can be found in the EFA Action Alert distributed in late
August, and also on EFA's Web site at <http://www.efa.org.au/EFA>.
   Government action has been foreshadowed in the media by Attorney-General,
Michael Lavarch, and Minister for Communications and the Arts, Michael Lee.
The consultation paper was issued by Lee's department and contains a section
outlining "POSSIBLE OFFENCES RELATING TO USE OF AN ON-LINE INFORMATION SERVICE"
.
   It is a follow-on from the government's BBS Task Force which released its
report late last year. After pressure from EFA and the Australian Computer
Society, the BBS report has finally been made available online at
<http://www.dca.gov.au/bulletin_board/report.htm>.
   The deadline for comments on the Consultation Paper has passed, but in a
public message on September 1, 1995, a representative of the Department
called for further submissions "as soon as possible". The Internet e-mail
address for comments is consult@dca.gov.au.
      Please bear in mind that the consultation paper is only one step in a
long line of government maneouvres -- EFA will need the ongoing support of
the online community in its continued campaigns.



ABA to investigate online services
-----------------------------------

   In a related move, Minister Lee has Australian Broadcasting Authority
will conduct an investigation of on-line services and report back to his
department by 30th June, 1996.
   A spokesperson for the Department of Communications and the Arts says the
ABA will look at "the appropriateness of the development of codes of
practice for those services that are, as far as practicable, in accordance
with community standards... The ABA will also investigate the extent to
which on-line information and entertainment broadcasting services are
accommodated by the operation of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992."
   Members of the online community have questioned the appropriateness of
the ABA's involvement, but Minister Lee sees the ABA investigation as
complementary to the Consultation Paper on the Regulation of On-line
Information Services.



PGP ban proposed in Australia
------------------------------

   A new battle for online freedoms has begun in Australia now that
regulation of encryption technology has been proposed by Steve Orlowski,
Assistant Director of the Australian Attorney General's department.
   In a speech to a Queensland conference on the subject, Orlowski suggested
public access to strong encryption technologies should be restricted.
   Such legislation exists in the USA, where it is illegal to export strong
encryption technology and the government has attempted to introduce the
controversial Clipper Chip and key escrow encryption.
   This has resulted in a long legal battle for Phil Zimmerman, author of
PGP, the Internet's most widely used encryption package -- see the Web site
<http://www.netresponse.com/zldf/> for more information. It also means that
products such as Netscape Communications Corp's Web software have shipped
with weak encryption which crackers have been able to surmount.
   The supporting argument is generally that criminals must be prevented
from using strong encryption technology, even if this means taking privacy
away from everyone else.
   "I feel that the needs of the majority of users of the infrastructure for
privacy and smaller financial transactions, can be met by lower level
encryption which could withstand a general but not sophisticated attack
against it. Law enforcement agencies could develop the capability to mount
such sophisticated attacks," said Orlowski.
   He said a re-examination of the issues was scheduled to co-incide with
deregulation of Australia's telecommunications system in 1997. Orlowski's
speech has attracted international attention and contributed to rumours that
the US government is pressing its allies into enacting copycat encryption
policy.



Call for assistance
--------------------

   Unlike the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFA doesn't have a six-digit
budget, corporate sponsors and paid staffers. EFA is run by volunteers and
relies on member contributions for its income.
   Please help by contributing your time or other resources. We're
particularly interested in people willing to assist in legal research, help
prepare submissions for government inquiries, and act as local contacts for
media, government and public.
   At the moment EFA is investigating the possibility of moving our Web
pages to a site equipped with Netscape Commerce Server, so that membership
fees can be paid online. We are wondering if anyone out there has a site
that could host this?
   One recent example of a contribution to EFA is our new FTP site at
ftp://ftp.efa.org.au/pub/efa.
   Contact membership@efa.org.au if you have anything to volunteer.



EFA Annual General Meeting

standing for election, will be sent to all members prior to the AGM.
   Nominations for positions on the board must be received by the Secretary
in writing signed by the proposer and the nominee to signify a willingness
to stand for election. Both proposer and nominee must both be EFA members.
Nominations close 28 days prior to the AGM, ie on Sunday 10th September. If
proposer and nominee are unable to sign the same paper, separate notices to
the Secretary will be accepted.
   Nominations should be posted to:

Electronic Rights and Responsibilites (ERR)
-------------------------------------------

   Peter Merel's evolving list of "Electronic Rights and Responsibilities",
endorsed as a working project by EFA in April, has undergone several more
drafts since the last time you read this newsletter.
   Merel regularly posts updated versions of the ERR to the newsgroup
aus.org.efa (gatewayed to the efa@efa.org.au mailing list),
comp.org.eff.talk, the EFA echo on Fidonet, and to his Web site at
http://www.usyd.edu.au/~pete/err.html. He invites suggestions and
contributions from all interested parties.
   The ERR is designed "to provide an ethical standard with which to measure
the policies of states and corporations with regard to the Internet and
related multicast communications networks", and was put together using
suggestions from around the world.
   EFA is actively looking for BBS Sysops willing to make files such as the
ERR document available for downloading and FREQ. If you are interested
please send netmail to EFA at 3:632/552.



Western Australian Internet Association
----------------------------------------

   In Western Australia, access providers and the Internet user community
have formed the WAIA (Western Australian Internet Association) to deal with
local and national issues. Details can be found at <http://www.it.com.au/waia>.
   Announcements regarding WAIA will be posted to a mailing list -- you can
subscribe to the WAIA list by sending a message to majordomo@iinet.net.au,
with only the words "subscribe waia" in the body of the message.
   The spokesperson for WAIA is Kimberley Heitman, whose e-mail address is

TIP OF THE MONTH
-----------------

   If you'd like to see something in particular covered by "Tip of the
Month", please send your suggestion to editor@efa.org.au or EFA Editor at
3:632/552. Meantime, here's a guide to getting the most out of the
Australian end of the Internet.
   Every Australian Internet user eventually becomes aware of slowdowns in
file transfer speeds from overseas servers, whether via FTP or the Web. At
peak usage periods, this can become unbearable -- however, it's often
possible to get around the problem by using an Australian mirror site. The
term "mirror" is used on the Internet to refer to duplicates of a site made
in order to ease the load on the original location, making it easier for
more users to enjoy the benefits of that site.
   Please note that this advice is for Australians only, and if you're
reading this newsletter in another country, you should not use the following
sites.
   For example, if you're a Windows user in Australia waiting for a file to
come in from the famous CICA Windows archive at ftp.cica.indiana.edu, you're
crazy! There are several partial mirrors around, and a full mirror is at
ftp.cc.monash.edu.au, in the directory /pub/win3.
   And if you're an art buff trying to download an image from the WebMuseum
(WebLouvre) in France, you'll be pleased to know it's possible to do this
much faster by using the Australian mirror at
<http://cutl.city.unisa.edu.au/louvre/louvre.html>.
   If you act like a good Net citizen and adopt as many mirror sites as you
can, you'll be making life better for yourself and others. Your file
transfer speeds will be much faster, and you'll be freeing up bandwidth for
everyone else on Australia's international links. Your modem or other
connection device will start to really impress you!
   On the Web, there are several indexes to help you find mirror sites. If
you're about to transfer something from overseas via FTP, check yourself and
take a look at <http://www.unimelb.edu.au/public/aumirrors.html>, which is a
guide to FTP mirror sites in Australia. A searchable guide to all Australian
web servers is at <http://www.csu.edu.au/links/ozweb.html>, though you may
prefer the Aussie Index at <http://www.aussie.com.au/>.
