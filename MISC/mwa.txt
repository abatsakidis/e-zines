~-INTRODUCTION-~

FINALLY! A voice from the Midwest! It's been too long, hasn't
it? We've been the birthplace of a lot of places, most notably
Phrack, but decades pass and things change. It's an odd time 
we're living in, when legislation is considering bills that 
would make the most trivial part of geek life a felony... but 
I'll let Emmanuel Goldstein whine about that. Anyways, this 
zine has been inspired on no small part by Hack Canada's zine
K-1ine and the se2600's PhreakNIC and interz0ne cons.
Get back, put on your seat belts, and prepare for MWA!

~-IT "Morons" and the Security Equation-~
 
It seems that the private sector and government networks of 
today are deployed in a careless fashion. Border routers and 
firewalls are mis-configured, boxes are not up to date, and 
all too often administrators rely on precious anti virus and 
software as well as Intrusion Detection for defense. In my 
opinion this is due to lack knowledge when it comes to security 
but also a lack of concern and motivation. The reality is that 
anti virus software and IDS do not protect against zero day 
exploits as well as non-disclosed vulnerabilities. However, 
these are still excellent tools but administrators must 
recognize that the internal networks must be as secure if not 
more secure than the borders. You may say that IDS does help 
with intrusion detection on an LAN or local machine. True, it 
helps detect penetrations and network anomalies on local 
machines as well as across the network. I would say that a 
good administrator would not deploy snort and leave his 
machines unlatched and misconfigured, that is ignorant and 
lazy. If a hacker or worm was to penetrate into a non DMZ'ed 
LAN with unlatched boxes, the results could be disastrous: 
loss of corporate inside information, loss of monies, damage 
of payroll, etc. Think of a network as battle lines. Would 
you put all your troops at the front line at once and leave 
behind the lines unprotected? No because paratroopers and 
spies could penetrate the fronts lines and wreak havoc!

I believe that greedy commercial programmers are to blame but 
also the administrators of the private sector networks. They 
are allowing themselves to be considered morons. Let’s analyze 
the average systems administrator for a moment. Most have an 
MCSE or Cisco CCNA certification which means they can read a 
book and remember the content. Most administrators do not keep 
up with the latest computer virii, exploits, or security 
methods. It seems their concern is just keeping the network up
and available for employees. This kind of motivation is why 
many security issues exist today, simple lack of motivation as 
well as knowledge.

One more important issue that I will touch on is allowing 
sensitive machines that handle, for example payroll and bank 
accounts, to be allowed access to the Internet or access to 
networks that have Internet access. I cannot stress how moronic 
this is! All machines that could be considered sensitive in any 
respect must be isolated on a private network. The cost or 
convince to employees is not a concern when it comes to 
security. A great example comes to mind. A Norwegian power 
company had its network accessible to the Internet and came 
under attack. The idea that Blaster caused the large blackout 
a few months back also proves my point. Sensitive machines 
and networks must be isolated regardless of cost or 
inconvenience.

If administrators would simply patch machines, lock down 
unnecessary services, and configure routers properly security 
would be much better. The question I ask is will this happen? 
It seems that most of these administrators are only in it for 
the paycheck; they have no greater concern for the data they 
protect. Do I expect them to stay an hour or so extra to patch 
a few servers or update the anti virus definitions, no!

Remember:

~-Inherit The Byte-~

I've already written several articles on AI, but they were all 
dealing with progressive issues (how can we get the machine to 
do x). In this article, I'm going to concentrate on the 
consequences of what could happen assuming we've attained a 
program that is sentient. 

First, imagine the following scenario: there is a string of 
infamous murders across a metropolis, and after long 
investigation, police and detectives finally catch the guilty 
man. As is customary with crimes of a serious nature, there is 
an intensive psychological interrogation, through which they 
discover that this man did not commit these murders by his own 
free will, but by a foreign machine program that forced him 
to commit them. 

At first, this seems extremely fanatical. How can a machine 
possibly do that? Let's look at it from a neurological point of 
view. Our nervous systems are composed of elabourate networks 
of neurons which send electric signals back and forth to each 
other. For example, when you touch a snowball, the "coldness" 
is picked up by sensors in your fingers and the "cold" signal 
is sent to your brain. The actual biology is far more complex 
and integrated, but this idea will work for our purposes. 
So imagine the body as a neural network where the brain can 
send a signal to your hand saying "too cold! get away from the 
snowball!" and you drop it. The Strong AI viewpoint then 
follows that there must be some kind of language or algorithm 
which your brain uses to communicate with your hand, or with 
any other part it needs to contact. So perhaps someone could 
devise a program, similar to a computer processor, that would 
direct signals to body parts when needed. We've already seen 
similar programs written to control 3D characters, so 
theoretically (and we -are- dealing with a theoretical world 
at the moment) a program could be written which, when activated 
by a device connected to your brain, can cause you to do 
anything. In fact, in our story, this is just what has happened 
to the guilty man. 

Given this progression of thought, the natural step for the 
investigators was to shift the guilt from the actual 
perpetrator, who had little/no control over his body, to the 
person who'd written the program. That is, if we were to view 
the guilty man as part of the program output, then it would not 
be him but the creator, or the programmer, who should be found 
guilty. This was the conclusion until the police found the 
programmer, who was a 15 year old kid who had no idea his work 
had caused the havok. 

If this is hard to believe, take into account the notion of a 
self-modifying program. Today, software exists that can look on 
the internet for updates, and update itself automatically. This 
is especially important in the era where the vast majority of 
computer users are illiterate to concepts like updating their 
virus definitions or checking their package dependencies. It's 
quite common to write a program to check a website for dead 
links, or to scan through bash scripts making sure everything 
is in proper. What about integrated devices? If we have a 
system written into traffic lights, maybe it uses a camera to 
monitor the traffic and adjust the light timings for variations 
in traffic density. Or maybe you have a robot which, when it's 
running low on batteries, finds the nearest power outlet and 
charges itself. All these concepts being the case, it's quite 
understandable that when a program runs, while it completely 
follows the rules built into it by the programmer, performs 
tasks completely differently than its programmer could have 
ever imagined. 

However, the computer world and the legal world don't always 
understand each other. In our case, there have been murders 
comitted, and the victims' families want justice-- the courts 
must resolve the question of who to blame. The man who 
committed the crimes claims innocence, and he has the 
scientific and psychological backing sufficient to satisfy his 
plea. The programmer is just a kid who was writing an engine in 
his spare time; he's more worried about getting laid than 
killing innocent people. 

We've fallen into an interesting dillemma: logically, the guilt 
must fall onto the computer program itself. But this involves 
several seriously controversial things: first, in order to hold 
the program guilty, we must recognize that it has free will and 
consciousness. There are so many sides of that argument that 
entire books have been written on it. Second, how the hell can 
we try and punish a computer? As far as we know, it 
has no concept of time save for clock cycles, and if we "forbid"
it to perform any tasks for any number of clock cycles, it will 
follow obediently without concern. We could disconnect it and 
pass a law forbidding its activation, but that might affect 
whatever original "good" purpose it had. Finally, does the legal 
system really have any authority here? Any final sentence could 
be about as effective as ordering zero to be equal to one. 

So what can the conclusion be? Personally, I'd say the best 
decision would be to declare a mistrial, because it would avoid 
setting into law that the system can be an individual. On the 
other hand, we still have these victims who need some kind of 
legal satisfaction, and giving the kid 500 hours of community 
service (writing a program shouldn't result in jail) certainly 
doesn't sound very fulfilling. Realistically, the perpetrator 
would probably be placed in prison to satisfy the crowd,
although from a geekist standpoint that certainly doesn't seem 
fair-- indeed, quite frightening. 

Get ready to see a lot more scenarios like this, but far more 
involved and complex. As we move closer to a world of complete 
interconnectivity and bizarre technology, even if by the Strong 
AI view we're primitive, the issues continue to get more 
convoluted and challenging. In a sense, it's almost like chaos 
theory coming to life. If there are situations where a justice 
system is this inconclusive and ineffective, then we might 
eventually need to rewrite or even abolish our system. That 
sounds really scary and fanatical, but then again, so does a 
world where machines are living conscious beings. Do we trade 
one for another, or is it possible to evolve both commensally 
without losing integrity on either side? Perhaps this is the 
question we need to answer before we proceed any further, but 
only time will tell.

~-GEB Review-~

A Review of _Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid_ (GEB)
by Douglas R. Hofstadter

For the past two years I've had a list of my favourite books: 
_The Giver_, _1984_, and _Atlas Shrugged_. Now it seems I must 
add a fourth to this list, GEB. I'm not sure whether it's the 
amazing coverage of computer science philosophy, the "entire 
humanist education between the covers of a single book" as John 
Casti put it, or the fact that virtually every interest 
imaginable is somehow covered by Hofstadter's.... philosophy, 
but something makes me want to run into the streets praising 
this book. I will say this much: no computer science student 
should be awarded a degree without having read it. 

So I ramble on and on about it, and I was doing so at a party 
in England when a friend asked me to explain it to him. I 
started out with the definition Hofstadter gives in the 20th 
Anniversary preface: "a very personal attempt to say how it is 
that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter." Then, 
realizing that wasn't really enough, I described the MU-puzzle 
of the first chapter; essentially, you're given a set of rules 
and a set of symbols and told to solve a puzzle. The first few 
chapters introduce more puzzles and more rules, and describe the 
various thought approaches to solving them. This involves 
getting into somewhat heavy math at some points (I wound up 
teaching myself Discrete Math without realizing it ^_^). 
However, this math theory is intertwined with at times identical 
parallels in music and art theory, as well as colourful Lewis 
Carroll themed dialogues, to make the material easier to digest. 

In the second part, Hofstadter starts going farther. Since a lot 
of math has been covered, he looks at the other side of the
solution process: the human thought, or how our minds operate 
when searching for the answer. He dives into basic neural 
networks and heavy psychology, at the same time introducing 
fundamental computer programming. Then, about midway through, he 
introduces Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and relates it back to 
mental thought brilliantly. There are many more surprises I 
won't give away, but in "inventing" a computer science 
education, he takes it into the realm of AI theory, and ends the 
book as if not more fantasic than it was begun. 

There is one critique I want to comment on. Many other reviews 
of GEB have nagged about his "prediction" near the end that 
computers will never defeat humans at chess, especially after 
the 1997 Kasparov challenge. His exact response was: "No. There 
may be programs which can beat anyone at chess, but they will 
not be exclusively chess players. They will be programs of 
-general- intelligence, and they will be just as temperamental 
as people." My interpretation of this is not that computers will 
never beat anyone at chess, but that while chess-champion 
computers will exist, they will be able to do more than just 
play chess. For example, a future computer skilled at chess
might also have comparable skill at go, backgammon, or 
processing global thermonuclear warfare data. This especially 
makes sence when you consider that a computer is a math machine, 
and these games can be interpreted with pattern analysis, which 
was one of the main points of the book. Alas, time can be a 
brutal dictator. 

Perhaps the main problem I have with this book is the massive 
amount of content it covers. While this means it takes a really 
long time to read (but well worth it), it also means that you're 
exposed to a huge amount of ideas, and when you go on to more 
dedicated volumes you see the same patterns. GEB forces you to 
look at the world in a new way that you really can't let go. But
that's the price you pay for a good education, and for whatever 
Hofstadter doesn't cover, he lists additional references in the 
massive bibliography. 

Should you read this book? That all depends on how you want to 
spend your life. Would you rather let it pass by, enjoying a 
good moment of silence every now and then? Or do you prefer 
constantly looking through ideas, books, music and art for this 
same fundamental meaning, trying to discover as much as you can 
about life, the universe, and everything? This book is the 
perfect fuel for a geek, a good amplifier for a jaded geek, and 
a magical introduction to a geekling. One thing is for sure: 
I will never forget the amazing experience that was my first 
reading of GEB.

~-21st Century Folk Music-~

After a brief introduction and a couple e-mails w/ aestetix, I 
now find myself providing an article about a subject that is 
perhaps one of the greatest contributions from a computer-- 
Electronic Music.

I know, I know. "Zombie Nation", car commercials, and the Venga 
Boys. I'm going to ask you to drop these ideas from your mind 
and perhaps wonder where all this came from. In order to get 
where we are now we have to understand where these ideas and 
techniques originated. In doing this, believe it or not, we can 
relate all electronic music forms to Country Bluegrass. Yes you 
heard right, Bluegrass. Now to sum up in a paragraph what I 
learned in semester of American history of music, Bluegrass is 
very close to the roots of blues, contemporary country, and it's 
greatest evolution, Rock and Roll. Bluegrass had it's greatest 
following during the 'multi-media strapped' times of America 
when the most popular form of entertainment was the radio. And 
while the structure of the music itself isn't similiar; its 
shares the same soul. The soul that I'm referring to is most 
commonly known as 'Folk Music'. These are songs that are 
delivered as an expression of what the song writer not only 
wants you to hear but most importantly wants you to feel. These 
are songs of emotion not written in hopes of record sales but 
merely as a tool to reflect where the author is in their life at 
a certain time. For a precise history or time-line you can do a 
search on Google.

Now we have a foundation, the soul. Granted we have many 
different flavors, but outside of different time signatures and 
beats per minute (BPM) there is essentially the same structure 
within each flavor; which is why electronic music is so easy to 
mix. So if this music is so similar why are there so many types? 
Basically because many people have different feelings to 
portray. For the most part producers of electronic music are 
today's Bluegrass singers of late. Each with an opinion or tale 
to tell. Each with a feeling or experience to express.

These songs that are made are a result of hacking. Though no 
system's security is bypassed nor any database illegally 
accessed; the true artists of electronic music are hackers. Many 
sounds produced by drum machines and synthesizers are a result 
of users pushing the limits of their equipment or altering its 
original function (like phreakers make boxes) in order to 
achieve a flavor of their own. Innovations in technique progress 
knowledge about the music much quicker than new innovations in 
hardware. With that being said however, there is one piece of 
equipment that has revolutionized producing electronic music--
the laptop. With today's powerful processors and significant 
advances in multimedia software, electronic music is tumbling 
more towards laptops rather than dedicated machines. Laptops now 
encompass entire studios giving the producer more options with 
much less cost. This gives the producer more freedom and in turn 
personalizes his or her music even more. Just as Rock'n Roll and 
rap began, the result is modern day folk music.

So if producers are so great, why is it that all the talk is 
about DJs? If producers are the yin, DJs are the yang. Producers 
provide the soul while DJs apply it. A good DJ isn't necessarily
 about having a great mixing technique or the ability to match 
beats. Rather good DJs will take you on a journey during their 
set. They will start you off, bring you up, and then ease you 
down. This is achieved all by the records that they themselves 
like. These are songs that they have been exposed to and feel so 
intensly about that they too want you to feel what the producer 
is trying to achieve. DJs also try to release songs that are for 
the most part unknown. Anyone can get a record from Paul 
Oakenfold and play it at a party, however its probably something 
that others have heard before. The true gems are songs you find 
while digging through the archives in a store. Or if you are 
lucky enough tohave friends who produce, you get to be exposed 
to whole albums that many may never hear. DJs get noticed for 
song selections while producers get known for creating the 
tracks. The two coincide together in this balance.

Where can I hear this great music? This can be tough. Mainstream 
media has raped this form of expression as it does most 
everything else. I guess my best advice would be to stay away 
from anyplace where DJs are put up on a pedestal while mixing. I 
mean what if you hear a song and wanna know more about it? How 
can you look to see the label or sleeve if the decks are 7 feet 
from the floor?  DJs are there to provide vibe, not perform 
maneuvers. Producers playing live sets usually happen in smaller 
venues. If you have a chance to see any producers play live, I 
highly suggest going. Its very interesting to see and you get a 
good idea of just how complex making the music can be. 
Regardless of the type of delivery, both will deliver sounds 
that are original, personal, and full of substance. Typically 
these are not songs producedunder the stress of a contract but 
more conceived under the notion of a gift. A contribution from 
users creating art on their computers for their friends to enjoy 
and have a good time with.

~-The MW2600 Project-~

Sometimes it seems this zine and the "Bootleg" PhreakNIC 7 shirt
came out of nowhere. In fact, six months ago (circa DefCon) I 
had no idea I'd be not reading a zine (Phrack, K-1ine, etc) but 
writing for one! Where this zine and other things go are 
unpredictable at this point, but they do have an origin.

I think it was the September 2600 meeting in St. Louis that the
idea was born. I'd collected a friend or two to attend a casual 
meeting,and for the most part it was. However, a guy named 
w1nt3rmut3 (apologies if that's misspelled) had come down from 
Chicago, with a friend from Milwaukee, proposing that we form a 
new meeting place somewhere in Illinois between us... 
essentially, merge the Chicago and St. Louis groups. Sounded 
like an idea worth considering to me, as I'm definately
willing to drive a few hours when I know it'll be worth it. 
However,it would only be done every few months, a larger 
crowd... it was starting to sound like a con! There had been a 
lot of voice aboutthrowing one in St. Louis, Gateway to the West 
and such, but it takesa lot more planning and preparation than a 
spontaneous meeting. 

A few days later, I pitched the idea to Elonka (who'd missed the
meeting), and she responded with two things: one, taking 
three/four hours to drive somewhere for a single meeting for a 
single night wasway overboard; she absolutely refused it. Fair 
enough. However, she said, what -would- be a fabulous idea would 
be to start a base of networking for the Midwest. She used the 
example of SE2600, where there was a main site set up with 
general links to different regional meeting pages, FAQs and a 
listserv. They were well enough connected and had enough money 
(and brains) running around that they even threw annual cons 
(PhreakNIC, @LANta_con, interz0ne). If we set up something like 
that, then all the Midwest talent could join and eventually 
realize our own con! 

That same night I registered mw2600.org and threw up a temp page 
on my website with a redirection. Next, I started contacting 
people, namely kello from Springfield, MO and Battery from 
Chicago. They seemed quite keen on the idea, and I put links to 
the Springfield and Chicago pages on mw2600.org. Then things 
started going slow. I was having difficulty finding a good web 
ho$t, at the same time trying to juggle classes and working on 
my presentation for PhreakNIC 7 (PN7). Nearing PN7, things 
started turning around. 

I'd spent considerable time making my own tshirt design for PN7 
because I didn't think I'd like the official one, and wound up 
dropping a lot of money to get them printed. However, at PN7 
things were looking up. I met a couple kids from Chicago, and 
even a few from the fabled KC meeting that I'd been trying to 
hunt down. Sold shirts and spread the word... the mw2600 idea 
was beginning to get some authority and respect. w00t!

So time passes, and the hype dies down; but mw2600 is still up,
the site gets updated whenever anything new and cool happens,
and I'm hoping this zine will trigger even more interest and
provide a good outlet. Like the FAQ on the site says, the entire 
purpose of the project is to join everyone, to provide a base 
for networking. Some kid from Bumfsck, Missouri wants to get in
on the scene, he goes to mw2600.org, joins the listserv, reads 
the zine, and, of course, finds the web site and contact
information for the group closest to him. 

It's about connectivity, about spreading and sharing ideas. 
I still abide by the original ethic though I absolutely refuse 
to call myself a "hacker". The meaning of that word has been 
distorted, scrambled, and convoluted over the years by media, by 
books claiming to preach it's virtues, and any other scapegoat 
that comes to mind. But it hasn't been lost. There are still 
some who recognize it for what it means (or pick their favourite
from the Jargon file :p) and live by it. MW2600 is an attempt
to call that meaning and rebuild it from scraps into an 
empire of creativity. 

Will it work? I have no idea. But it's better to take the gamble
and lose than to never have something that was there. It's 
the people that will make it happen.

-These idiots debuted their "HaXXXor" video at DefCon XI, to 
everyone's dismay. They exploit and embarass the scene, and are
a disgrace especially to true geek girls. They're going to try
to release their second video at interz0ne 3; while they are 
legally free to, it is in bad taste, and I urge everyone to
boycott their products. DO NOT BUY HAXXXOR VOL.2!!!!!!!!!!!
