        "My life sucks.
         I am pathetic, and I thought I'd bitch about it in a poem.
         You don't understand me, You can NEVER understand ME.
         You are a filthy uneducated pig.
         Always attempting to understand, but never actually doing it.
         To hell with you, let me be alone.
         My life sucks."

        QD is back and better than ever.   (Notice better is
   relative)  We're slapin' some new improved bull shit straight 
   in your direction.  Some people may wonder what QD is about 
   and why the hell the contributors don't have lives.  The 
   answer is simple- we don't know either.  So instead of wasting 
   our time doing nothing, we waste your time writing stuff that 
   you will read.  Yes, reading is not an option.  You have to 
   read this.  Human curiosity will not let you not read this. 
   For example-  There might be something you want to read 
   somewhere in this QD magazine.  If you don't read it you will 
   never know.  But since you now have a copy of QD (you are 
   reading this, right?)  you have the ability to find anything 
   you might want to read.  Just think, somewhere deep inside 
   this text you might stumble upon a piece of information that 
   you wanted to know, but didn't know it.  If that doesn't make 
   you want to read this, then don't.  Be warned if you don't 
   though, because if not, you could very posibly not be a 
   human.  And if that's the case, the QD staff doesn't WANT you 
   to read this.  In fact, all aliens on this planet can go back 
   to where they came from and stop bothering us.  We don't like 
   you guys!  Don't experiment with us!  Don't fly your saucers 
   in our nice skies!  Don't use my dogs brain waves for fuel!  
   If you guys were nice aliens you wouldn't do that stuff!  Stop 
   it!  ANYWAYS.. Welcome to QD #2.. (BTW, please don't 
   discorporate while reading this.. We have had several complaints 
   from the feds on this topic.. (ie- discorporate about an hour 
   afterwards so they can't connect it with us..)  We'd really 
   appreciate it..  thanks..)

                            HISTORY OF INTERNET

        The internet was programmed by Bill Gates in late 1984.  It is 
contained on a huge computer somewhere in Colorado.  All of the local phone
numbers you call connect via bouncing the laser signals off the moon to
the computer in Colorado.  To confuse all the DOS users, Internet's OS is
something called UNIX.  

LOGGING ON THRU UTK

1).  Type 'c duncan'
        Provided you have an account, you are then on the internet.
2).  Type 'c telnet'
        After you do this, you can say 'open duncan.utk.edu'.  Then you 
        will be logged onto Duncan.  Once again, you need an account.  Also,
        you must supply the IP address to get to non-local servers.
3).  Type 'c library'
        This will connect you to the WWW.  Unfortuneately, UTK has recently
        removed the 'G' option which would enable you to get to any site.  
        However, there are still ways.  If you are just looking for a WWW
        page, you can still access those using the search engines.  Also, you
        may search for 'VERONICA'.  Once there, you can search gopher space
        for 'Telnet Resources', once you get the results (you'll have to keep
        trying until you get through), go into one of the DIRs labeled 
        'Telnet Resources' and look for the 'Open Telnet' option.  From
        there, it should be obvious.  [editors note: This is slower than all
        the busses in the world combined.]
        

BASIC UNIX COMMANDS

ls      List files in current directory
        -l option will list all info on the files
        -a option will list all hidden files

rm      Removes a file
        -r option will delete all files in all sub directories.
           (kinda like DOS's deltree)

mkdir   Makes a DIR

rmdir   Removes a DIR

who     Lists who is online

cat     Displays a file

ypcat   Another way to display files, ;)

more    Lists files with a pause

write   Writes a message to another user online

chmod   Changes the mode of a file
        o=other
        u=owner
        g=group
        x=executable
        r=read
        w=write
        Examples:
        chmod a+w <file> (gives all people write privs)
        chmod a-r <file> (takes away read privs from all)

ps      Lists processes
        -u option allows you to look at user's processes
        -l option lists 'long' info
        -f option lists 'full' info

kill    Kills a process
        -9 <PID> option will kill the process immediately

pwd     Lists your location

passwd  Change your passwd

env     Lists your environment variables

su      Sends cookies thru your phone line.  Great fun.  Do it often.

rlogin  Lets you log onto other computers specified in your /.rhosts
      
telnet  Opens a Telnet session

ncftp   Opens a ftp connection, a little more convenient than normal FTP
        open <site>      Will open a site
        get <file>       Will get the specified file
        mget <wildcard>  Will get all the specified files
                (mget *.* will get EVERY file)
        'cd' will change DIRs
        'ls' will list files
        'more' will let you read a text file

irc     Connect to Internet Relay Chat.  YAY!

lynx    Connect to the WWW



WAYS TO PISS OFF OTHER USERS ONLINE

        Well...every once in awhile you want to piss someone off.  This can
be fun and very productive. ;)

write <username> <message>

        This will let you write messages to other users.

banner <message> | write <user>

        Will display <message> in HUGE letters on <user>'s screen.  This is
        also annoying.  

cat <binaryfile> | write <user>
        
        Will display a binary file on THEIR screen.  This is very annoying,
        as you can imagine.

                    -= BOB! A very happy resident virus =-

 May not be anything new, but this little guy has some fun with dos.  
 Actually it screws dos into thinking that anything named BOB.COM is really 
 named BAB.COM.  When bob takes it's grip it doesn't let go.  In other words, you 
 can't delete bob! YES! Hail BOB. BOB ro0lz. BOB will not relent! 
 (Sorry, I gets carried away sometimes)

 Well here is the source to BOB, long live BOB.

                     Social Engineering Techniques

        Ok, so, you're too lame to get your own accounts, and no one
        seems willing to give you one.  So, what do you do?  Why not
        try a little social engineering?  Never underestimate the
        stupidity of your opponent.  Here at QD, we have included
        some of our own successful Social Engineering feats.

   QD:   Hello, is this the CS lab at UTK?
   THEM: Yes, how can I help you?
   QD:   Well, my name is Jim Brown.  My user name is jbrown, but I
         think that someone may have a hold of my passwd.  Can you
         change it for me?
   THEM: Ok, please hold...
   QD:   La la la la...
   THEM: Student ID number please?
   QD:   Uhhhhh....524-56-2139-032
   THEM: Could you please repeat that?
   QD:   Sure....734-123-6773-32112-3...
   THEM: Thats not the same number as before.
   QD:   Yes it is!  Its always been 3673-234-6541-12!!
   <click>

        Ok...so, that one didn't work so well...but some of these later
        ones are fool-proof!

   THEM: Hello, UTK Computer Science department.
   QD:   Ok, thank you.  My name is Robert K. Oot.  I have reason to
         believe that someone has gotten a hold of my account.
   THEM: User name, please?
   QD:   Root...
   THEM: Ok...please hold...
   QD:   La la la la...
   THEM: Hey!  Wait a second...
   <click>

        Damn...so close...maybe next time...

   (DC = Dumb chick)

   DC: Like, hello?
   QD: Hello, this is the UTK campus security.  We have reason to
       believe that someone has hacked into your computer account.
   DC: My, say what?
   QD: Your account on the UNIX server. Has your passwd always been
       'sierra'?
   DC: Like, yuck!  Stay away from me! I don't like eunechs!
   <click>

        If you do this one..you might want to just say 'Your account
        on the happy shiny machines with keyboards".  It might be a
        better idea.

   THEM: Hello, UTK Computer Science Department.
   QD:   Hello, my name is Bill Smith, username bsmith.  I have rea...
   THEM: Do you really think we are this stupid?
   QD:   Yes.
   <click>

   THEM: Hello, UTK Computer Science Department.
   QD:   MUHAHAH!  PHEAR QD!  BOW TO..
   <click>

   THEM: You again?
   QD:   What?  How dare you? This is the president of the United
         States..
   <click>

        Hmmmm...perhaps we should take another angle...

   THEM: UTK Computer Science Department, can I help you?
   QD:   Can I have root, puhleaze?
   THEM: Ok, sure.
   QD:   Killer!

        I hope this article has been helpful.

                               Computer Class

        Pascal is an infantile, out-dated language.  So, of 
   course, when various members of the QD staff took a pascal 
   course, they opted to test out and learn useful things on 
   their own.  So began the wonderous existence of the 
   Independant C class.  While the other bozos were learning 
   pascal on monochrome 386sx's, we huddled around the school's 
   new Pentium 75 in the back. We wrote various intros, 
   applications, and occasionally did our other school work if we 
   were really bored.  Life was good.  Then came....the network..

        The incompetent city workers had been planning on 
   setting up a network for several months.  But we figured, 
   "Hey, they're idiots...they'll never get around to it!"  
   Unfortunatly, one day at the beginning of class, we were told 
   that the pentium would be locked up, because the network would 
   be installed the next day.  Yeah right, we'll see about that!  
   We began to lock up the computer.  We put on BIOS passwds, 
   locked out the a: drive, made the proper switches in the 
   CONFIG.SYS, and wrote a password program that would reboot the 
   computer if a bad password was typed in.  Bad idea...later 
   that day, one of us was called down to the office to fix the 
   computer.  Of course, he gladly admitted to the crime and 
   fixed the computer.  

        The next day the network was installed.  A password 
   was put on BIOS. A ctrl-break and ctrl-c detector was 
   installed as a TSR.  The actual network cord was taken to keep 
   us from getting on.  Damn, no way through, right?  We then 
   began to dismantle the pentium.  Unfortuneatly, the battery 
   was welded on, and we could not locate the proper jumper to 
   take out the BIOS password. We then booted up the computer one 
   last time.  It sat at the end of a BATCH file, informing us of 
   an error in the network(it not be plugged in and all). In a 
   fit of randomness, someone hit ctrl-alt-sysrq-break.  Whoa, it 
   broke the batch file.  HAHA!  WE WIN AGAIN!

        We then began to search thru all the network stuff.  
   We searched all the bat files and configurations to understand 
   how the network worked.  But, now, the city won't let us touch 
   the computer anymore.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

              -= Ten easy steps to take over the world =-

During school and when i am home alone, i often wonder how i could take over
the world in ten easy steps.  i have not used the methods below due to 
sheer laziness.  However, i have decided to publish my ten step plan to
take over the world. Maybe someone out there is smart enough to carry out
my plans.

Step One
The main ingredient in taking over the world is evil bunnies.  These 
creatures are easy to find and abound in the millions.  Catch about
one hundred of them.

Step Two
In order to take over the world you also have to be smart enough to
understand what the word "existential" means and how to spell it 
correctly,

Step Three
Now steal or find some liquid nitrogen and mix in a large vat the evil
bunnies and the liquid nitrogen.  When the bunnies are sufficiently 
frozen, store them in a large freezer.  These animals are the turning
point for taking over the world.

Step Four
Now go on a door knocking campaigne and get people to give money to a 
charity.  Make up a flyer and pass it along.  This should give you ample
supplies of money.

Step Five
Now create a catchy slogan for when you speak to the public like
"Support the world wide take over, don't do drugs" or something like
that.

Step Six
Now with your dough and followers, cut the transatlantic communication lines.
Build a small rocket to take out the communications satelites (see figure 
one).

Step Seven 
Now with world having no communications what so ever, go to the white house
and freeze the president and cabinet and congress with liquid nitrogen.  
Soon the USA will be at your command.

Step Eight
As president you have the ability to fire big dangerous evil missles at
russia and where ever else you want to destroy. So talk to your spies
in russia and the third world nuke sites.  Now destroy the sites (your 
spies are expendable)

Step Nine
Now hirer all the militia and anarchystist groups so they can do something
useful other that plan the take over of the world. Let them help you
make tough decision and stuff.

Step Ten
Now thaw out the evil bunnies. (Also don't forget to wear your newly made
Ph34r QD t-shirts, see order form below).

                        -= A Glimpse of a Hacker =-
          
A typical day of hacking for the QD staff and friends.  For the elite
eyes only.  The following is capture file taking by one of our better
hackers.  All inphormation is classfied as on a need to know basis, and
you my friend need to know...
                            
                          Capture Opened At 11:30 pm

\ From now on I will make comments with the character '\' in front of the
\ line I make a comment on.  This stuff is not to be typed in during an 
\ actual hack.
\ First of all, every first of the month (ie, March 1), the sysadms take
\ a little stroll to the donut shop to visit with their other sysadm friends
\ from other UNIX sites.  These little parties last about 5 hours starting
\ around 11 pm to 4 am (most of the time, unless there is a fight).
\ Basically they talk about all the hackers that they locked out of their
\ system.  Well here is what I did.

          "Noone ever says `I wanna be a courier when I grow up.'"


   The following is a loose recontruction of several 
   conversations I have had with various local warez SysOps.

   AWK - Anonymous Warez Kiddie
   QD  - Anon. Quarantined Dementia Staffer

   K-rad warez kiddie pulls you into chat....

   AWK> y0y0y0!
   QD>  uhhhhhh, yes?
   AWK> Wazzup?
   QD>  Not much, just called to check you out.
   AWK> Are you on alot of warez boards?
   QD>  No, not really...
   AWK> I just got a 6.1 gigs of 0-day warez off the internet.
   QD>  Very impressive...
   AWK> I've collected 400 megs of h/p/a..!!
   QD>  I'm sure you've read it too..
   AWK> I'm getting a dual pentium 133 system with 4 28.8s for 
         christmas!  I'll be more k-r4D than all the people at my 
         school put together..
   QD>  Must be a lot of cool people at middle school..
   AWK> I'm affiliated with 14 couriering groups.
   QD>  Wow...
   AWK> Have you ever made a virus?  I'm the best with NLRG! I 
        can even teach you if you want..
   QD>  No thanks..
   AWK> Hey yea.. Hey!  I haqd a WWiV board in k3NtUckee last month!! 
        It was pretty kewl.. I used the arCHiV3 menu!
   QD>  I'm sure it was..
   AWK> I'm on this, like, really cool warez board in CA, you want
        the NUP?
   QD>  No...
   AWK> Why n0t?

   NO CARRIER
    
    
       We've all noticed it.  The sudden plethora of warez boards 
   appearing all over the place created by 13 year old SysOps 
   whose rich daddies bought them 10 gigs of HD space and a brand 
   new Pentium 120.  They boast of their computer knowledge in 
   terms of their hardware, their brilliant knowledge of DOS, and 
   the dozens of WaReZ FTP sites they have been given by other 
   people.  They use fancy acronyms and brag of their beautiful 
   ANSI drawings.  The modern computer rush has given any kid 
   with a new computer and a few connections access to every 
   piece of software in existence.  Some even have the nerve to 
   call themselves hackers (although the usually spell it 
   "haqr").  What a disgrace.  Do the scene a favor, call the SPA 
   at 1-800-388-PIR8.

Well the "shole" point to my message is that you are too DUMB and WEAK

Elite ways to get Cokes

You've seen all the great text files on how to get free cokes and food
and all that shit that's cooler that your grandma.. Did you try them?
Did ANY of them work?  That's what I thought.. ok.. now I'm going to
show you hows its done around here..

--

Method #1


There are several important begining steps with this approach.. First,
get a bag or something to put the food in once you have got it.. Then
get a pack of chewing gum w/the gum wrapper.  It's also a good idea
to have a get away vehicle.  Last, you need a large sledge hammer. Now
the elite fun starts happening.

With all the methods it's important to find a good site.. make sure there
aren't too many people around and it's not in clear sight of any donut
shop.  (or any place that sells donuts for that matter).. These places
are the cops head quarters.. Don't front with the cops.. they will bust
your ass and slam you in jail till your grandkids are in college.

Ummm.. I forget what to do now.. ok.. now I remember.. Drive up to the
site.. carefully take out a stick of chewing gum.. Unwrap it.. place
the chewing gum in your mouth.  Chew.  Throw the wrapper in a garbage
can.  Ok.. now.. take the sledge hammer and beat the living shit out
of the coke machine.  Things will happen.. But the most important of
these things is that the machine will open and you will have cokes..
Rock on! (we have tested this method before.. just in case you were
wondering about the veracity of this method)  Drive away quickly.  (Don't
forget to load your vehicle with cokes!)

--

Method #2


Get two quarters.

Enter them into the slot.

Retrieve coke.

Rock on!

--

Method #3


Get a bucket full of either liquid nitrogen or H2SO4..  drive up to the
coke machine and dump either of these all over it...  you WILL get cokes!

--

Method #4


Get a large pickup truck, four people that are pretty damn big, and one
of those wheely deals that you can load stuff on and then wheel it around.

Some important notes on the stuff you need..- Make sure the truck is a
good reliable truck.. not one with like doors and carborators and engines
always falling the hell out.. (red necks have these sorts of trucks..).. Um
...  Make sure you can trust the big people and that they won't just
steal your cokes.. (it's a good idea to pack your 9 when you're around
big people..)  And make sure they won't steal your fucking girl friend..
Make them sign a slip that says they won't do this.. or they will.. trust
me..  ok.. and the wheely deal.. make sure it's reliable too..  and
above all.. TRUST NO ONE..

Drive up to the site.. get the big people to steal the coke machine..
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PLUG.. you don't want your cokes cold, now do you?

Ok.. go back to your abode and plug the machine right in.. and jump into
it with all your force until it starts givin you cokes..  cool..  

--

Method #5


Shhh!  Don't tell anyone how to do this one!  I have found that if you
ask someone who has two cokes for one of their cokes, they will give it
to you.. "A wise man leads, but he sometimes follows too, if he's in that
lazy sort of mood that even wise men get in sometimes".. that has nothing
to do with this.. sorry..

--

Some important thing to remember-

Drinking coke makes you feel happy..  (why don't they use this for their
add campaign?  They are stoopid..) 

Girls are cool.. unless they won't give you a coke..

Coke is more important than ice fishing, dammit.

Don't drink coke with those little fizzy poppy candies cause your stomach
will explode.. and homie don't play that..

--

Ok.. that's it.. I hope you get lots of coke..

                        Quarantined Dementia FAQ

        Well, people are always asking us questions, since we are
   such a popular magazine.  So, I thought I'd answer some of the
   most common ones.

   Q:  Why did you write this magazine?
   A:  We were bored, really.

   Q:  What is this?  Some sort of cold fussion theory?
   A:  no..  Haarp is a station up in alaska (Air force..  this is a
       smaller version of the REAL one)  Haarp is testing to see if the
       Ionosphere can handle Gigawats of power...  They are using it as
       a giant antenna.. so they can send ULFs to subs and ships...
       also, they will be able to manipulate weather...

   Q:  Do you think people actually like this zine?
   A:  Yeah, we are eliTe!

   Q:  Is Spinoza as big a freak as it seems?
   A:  I know no Spinoza.

   Q:  What do you have against Warez, d00d?
   A:  Its actually just a repressed desire to be a courier.  We
       funnel it into humor to make ourselves feel better.

   Q:  Hey, can you pick a number between 3 and 528?
   A:  35

   Q:  Your zine sucks!
   A:  Not as hard as your MOTHER!  O-oh!

   Q:  Do you really hang out at Mr. Gattis?
   A:  Only if we are feeling paticularly social.

   Q:  Do you ever open a QD IRC channel?
   A:  You suck...

   Q:  Are you guys on drugs?
   A:  Right now?  No...

   Q:  Is Destacona a loser like it seems?
   A:  Yes, yes he is.

   Q:  Should I look forward to more exciting issues in the future?
   A:  There will be more issues.

   the elite qd rap

   woke up quick, at about noon
   just knew that I had to get some fresh kodez soon
   gotta do some hackin' before the day begins
   before the couriers start frontin' on my friends
   i went to the computer and i started to call
   dumb SysAdmins puttin' up firewalls
   grabbed my disk and I stuck in some C
   now them accts are comin' to me
   stuck 'em in cracker jack, to finish them off
   then I got a f0n3 call, it was from Yoss.

   'cause the boys of QD are elite
   if you need any inpho we got the h/p
   knowin' nuthing in life but to hack and phreak
   and we get more kodez every week.

   bored as hell and I want to get ill
   so I went to the spot where my homeboys chill
   went to gatti's, and I started drinkin'
   the coke was good, but my breathe started stinkin'
   went to Revco to pick up some mints
   I saw a dumb courier and I started to grin
   took him up the street to show him my way
   silly mutha f*cku pulled out the 0-day
   I reached in my pockets and pulled out accounts
   then I stepped back and knocked his lame ass out.

   'cause the boys of QD are elite
   if you need any inpho we got the h/p
   knowin' nuthing in life but to hack and phreak
   and we get more kodez every week.

   Went back to gatti's to see my friends
   We were all sittin' around, chillin' again
   We fronted on the buffet, and got kicked out
   Through the front door, I started to shout.
   "Its the system, man, bringin' us down."
   We jumped in the wagon, and rolled into town
   Then we let the radio cold kick (kick)
   playing Coolio and Al Yankovic
   We went to a house to mess with Grifter
   His kitchen floor looked like a damn shitter
   We left in a hurry and then started rollin'
   yeah, we got more codes than all of Oakland.

   'cause the boys of QD are elite
   if you need any inpho we got the h/p
   knowin' nuthing in life but to hack and phreak
   and we get more kodez every week.
