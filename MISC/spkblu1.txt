----=+!* General Radio Telefone *!+=----
By    -(Harvester Of Souls)-

This article is about the Motorola Micro Tac flip fones.
Sometimes called the "Hacker's Fone".
This may vary from fone to fone.
Here are the basics you need to know to begin.

To look at the system ID, fone #, & station class marks
and much more, do the following.

1) Turn power ON.
2) Immediately press FCN, 0.
3) Type the Security Code Twice.  (Factory standard is 000000).
4) Scroll through the options with the * key.
5) Only make changes that are accurate!
-----------------------------------------------------
To put the fone into test mode do the following:

Disconnect any & all power from the fone.
There will be 3 contact leads on the back of the fone.
Short the middle pin to ground. The ground is usually
the contact lead to the right of it. (Test with a 
DMM to be sure). DMM - Digital Multi Meter.
When you apply power, you will find that the screen is
flashing hexidecimal numbers. Press the # key.
The display should show     US '
If it just shows a '  and not  us '  don't worry.
From either of those points you may type in commands
to the fone.

To listen in on a convo:
Type 11xxx, #           xxx = Channel number.
OR 11xxxx - May not be in use, who knows what its for.
NOTE: This is illegal & I dont recommend this since they
have triangulation methods. You have been warned!
The channels that I have listen to are anywhere from
112 to 999. I belive the fone will go up to channel 9999.
You may not be able to do anything, but I personally think
that it has the capabilities to do so.
I found that the most popular channels around
the suburban Boston area and up to Boston also
are these:

    112
    298
    299
    300
    301
    999
This may not be true for all areas. Just scan the channels
& see what you find.
---=+ Programming mode:
      After popping the fone into test mode,
Press 55#. Then there are multiple options, but I don't recommend
changing anything without a chart of what they do.

This is for a telefone-to-recorder. 
NOTE: Listening in is illegal unless authorized by at least one
party on the fone line.

Equipment: Soldier iron, solder, electrical tape or heat shrink.
Needs:     Double Female MOD Plug adapter, 1 LED, (1) 3 Lead switch,
           1 Stereo plug.

Instructions:
Open up the double mod plug & cut the YELLOW & BLACK wires in the CENTER.
If there isn't a yellow wire, cut the white.  Twist the two wires
together on each end & solder them together. now tape up the exposed
wires with electrical tape, or use heat shrink. 
Cut the RED & GREEN wires directly in the center. Solder 1 red 
lead of the wire to 1 lead on the switch. on the lead furthest away from the red,
solder one lead of the LED on it. Take the stereo plug & solder 1 lead
to the lead on the LED that is left. Now solder the second pole of
the stereo plug to the green wire. 
USAGE:
When the switch is flipped, & the plug is attached, the LED will light up.
That means that it is in use. (Recording or listening). When the plug is in
and the LED is OFF, then the device is off. Plug it into a recorder & next
time someone is on the phone, hit record & flip the switch. It may be
helpfull to have an audio pre-amp or amplifier.
Happy listening!  :)

Citizen's Band Radio (CB)
Note: All frequencies are in AM (Amplitude Modulation).
Channels marked with an 'a' are illegal channels that
can be used with a simple CB modification to the
RF tuner.
NOTE:   A Channels are illegal! And so are the channels
abouve 40 & below 1. Forget about modifying the radio for
extra channels (Not necessarily A channels) unless the
tranceiver has a PLL02A chip. Unless of course you want to
add a modification radio board, or a bunch of crystals
for a crystal modification. I have seen an LED mod with the
PLL02A that tells you what channel you are on. The kits are
available illegaly. But I believe it only gets up to channel 104.
And maybe down to 30 or 50 -1 including A channels. Enjoy....

---------=+!* Telefone Pickups *!+=----------------
 By:    -(Harvester Of Souls)-

NOTE: This MIGHT NOT work on all fones. Also, this is highly
illegal. I do not recommend you ripping off any telcos.
>
You can buy a Telephone Pickup at just about any good electronics
store. It should be in the fone section. The telefone pickup is a
little suction cup with a microphone behind it. You cannot see the
mic on most of them. With this mic, an amplifier, and tape recorder
you can record / play sounds to a telefone. What you need to do first
is build an amplifier. (Or take one out of something!). Plug the mic
into the amp, then the amp into the tape recorder MIC jack. Stick the
mic to the earpiece on the telefone. Cover up the microphone on the 
phone so that no unwanted noise interrupts. While your inserting coins,
make sure that the tape is recording. Insert AT LEAST 5$ in there, for
it to be worth your time. After you recorded & put the change in, get
your change back. To use the tones:
With the mic plugged into the amplifier, & the amp pluged into
the EARPHONE jack, place the mic on the fones microphone. Play the
tones to the phone, then complete your call. Try this with a fone in
your house, with an amplifier plugged into the pickup & a recorder.
I have heard stories that a certain pickup can detect & record audio
through a fone that is on the hook. As for the payfone, this may or may
not work with a laptop, I think that still is waiting to be discovered.
But...   just think of how handy it would be!
