As Georgie says "You are either with us or against us."
Well guess what--Fuck you! I'm against you and any other domineering 
person.

ANARCHY DOESN'T WORK UNLESS YOU DO
----------------------------------

Summertime phun:
 Defcon, other cons:
  *fuck with every whitehat there!
  *broadcast on the con freqs gov. classified material
  *print out prop. code on the printers
  *beat the shit out of government officials and paid whitehats
  *spread false 0-day via nfs
 Government:
  *steal 'secret' documents and place them on non-american public 
  servers
  *harass clueless gov. employees--we must make it to be 'not cool' 
  to work for the government
  *spoof email messages going to/from gov. sites with innacurate info
 Lans:
  *create network tunnels/gateways among friends to decentralize 
  network communication
  *create complex obfuscated code that confuses the hell out of people
  at universities (I know mine had readable/writable files all over the
  place)
 General:
  *what the fuck happened to blacklisting people? I know there are 
  enough bored teens that would be more than happy to prank phone
  call or shut off the power of some stupid whitehat
  *tell all the slashdot fuckers to shove it up their ass--you are a
  hacker and anarchist so don't respect their fucking ethics or values
  *rape the fuck out of network you find; create a new google that
  redirects all questions to better answers (eg: 'palestine' goes to
  an expose on the idf's murders)
  *for fuck's sake--learn something about the fucking world you live in
  otherwise you won't have one to learn from very soon!
 Software:
  *get off your ass and stop writing stupid tutorials that help 
  clueless whitehats or stupid programs that do the same fucking
  thing....smoke some weed, think about what would be cool; than do it
  *don't write windows viruses--those are even lamer than ./ 'hacking'
  instead write some really evil shit that do 3 wipe cleans on a system,
  infects computers via warhol method, anything you can dream up--do it
  for the sake of your freedom; the old saying of your freedom lies at
  the end of your fist next to the nose of someone else (their freedom);
  you can abide by cause you are on the ground with a bloody face full
  of pulp!

STOP USING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE: HOW CAN YOU FIGHT AGAINST THAT SHIT 
AND STILL USE IT? IF THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T EXIST FOR FREE EITHER STEAL
THE SOURCE CODE AND FREE IT OR GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASS AND WRITE YOUR
OWN!

Circuit Bending: Hop Aboard the Bandwagon

Why is this article in here? Simply because I'm taking it on myself to
release some 'real-world' hacking concepts into the memestream of
hackers. This involves short-circuiting electronic gadgets powered by a
battery to make new musical instruments (or a variety of things as we'll
soon find out that could make you INVINCIBLE! ;) So, let's start with
something small shall we? How about that DTMF dialer that everyone has??
Yes, this little toy has so many endless possibilities I'm upset circuit
bending hadn't started earlier.

things to have BEFORE you start:
jeweller's screwdriver
screwdriver
little cup or bag to put screws and shit in
roach clips for a lead (ask your mom if you don't have any)
soldering iron

Your typical Radio$Hack Tone Dialer looks like this:

This little bastard has six screws on the face and six more on the
board inside, which you need to take off also. You will need a jewler's
screwdriver for the inside ones (or you can find them at places like
Wal-Mart for eyeglass repair--I hear they have a five-fingered discount
year round) If a screw is stripped which happens to me every now and
then--I guess because of shitty fucking machines.. I don't know rip it
out because you should have a good supply of those fuckers. Keep a pad
of paper (or computer if you are good at ascii, and that means way
better than my shit) and pencil nearby to draw where any wires you
decide to cut or break go. Believe me, you will fuck up and not remember
where something goes.

Ok, so what are we doing? We are going to hack out a musical instrument
of this dialer. But first, once you have unscrewed your dialer take out
your lead and turn on the dialer. You must take the bridge slider and
press firmly on it till you see the red led light up and then two or
three seconds after that you will be able to start making connections.
Once again let's take a reality check...wtf are we doing? Well here's
the fun part take out your lead and start placing it on the copper
contacts connecting anywhere. Yes, short-circuit everything you can. You
might get slightly shocked and you can defeat that via grounding
yourself properly, but that's another article. Once you find some
interesting and different beeps write them down as the connections on
the piece of paper.

Now, get a variable resistor, or a potentiometer and place it somewhere
on the lead. Now try the circuits you discovered again and turn the nob
on the resistor. See how the pitch changes? That's one very simple
application of circuit bending. Try opening up an old cd player or
something else and looking for the rca or phono connector. Take it out
and solder it onto your dialer. You now have a way to hook up a speaker
or an amp to your gadget. Things can only get better!

Same thing with turntables except you are doing it with a five dollar
(in many cases) free piece of technology and you have endless
possibilities of not only what you can create but also the music you can
create from those gadgets. Very soon after a while of doing this you
will probably go completely insane with the creative momentum you are
about to unleash upon the world because there are so many other things
you can do with this and you shouldn't have to go to a technical school
or a university to be able to learn this.

DHS: You are being warned: you are in for trouble. Yes, we are being
very blunt as our zine implies. We would say you have broken the law of
the land but what the fuck do we care about laws? Since you won't change
your evil ways you have chosen hell. Prepare to enter the oven bi0tch!
Robert Liscouski, Tom Ridge, and all their little bitches are fucked.
If you work for the government you better get a different job (or not
work, heh!) cause otherwise you might wake up one day and see that you
have fifty subscriptions to Slut, all phone calls are routed to
Afghanistan, your cat is raped, you have been providing electricity to
your entire neighborhood for free and your entire office computer
network is an army of zombie computers ready and willing to do our
bidding.

Fucked Boxen

Yes, this is a list of boxen that are to be fucked or are already
fucked and they are all government boxen. Several of these have wised up
and restrict zone transfers from 'unsafe' sites. That's ok though, all
you have to do is find some stupid government employee on msn or icq,
trojan the box, then you should have local access to find all the boxen
you need.

I love it how the military thinks it can uses the same tactic tried by
other administrators and post a 'you will get fucked if you mess with
us' message on the server. Damn, they must be afraid. Well they have
used fear as crowd control for many decades now--let's turn the tables
on these fuckers.

dmdc.osd.mil ............................ Defense Manpower Data Center
defenselink.mil ......................... Gateway to .mil sites 
firstgov.gov ............................ Gateway to .gov sites
fema.gov ................................ disaster response (black budgets)
pfpa.mil ................................ Pentagon Police Department *
archives.gov ............................ NARA/NPRC **
offutt.af.mil ........................... STRATCOM ***

*   Pentagon Police Department (basically these guys can do whatever the
    fuck they want because they are part of the military but they are also
    police officers...wtf??)
**  the NPRC is now headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri  
*** STRATCOM headquartered at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb.
    hahaha!!! you should see the frontpage but 'make sure that your
    browser is Java enabled...' ;)

h0h0h0!!! STRATCOM must not know about phone phreaks. Check out
http://www.offutt.af.mil/Base_Information/base_phone_book.htm. I'll
write in a couple of numbers just in case this gets blacklisted.
Fuck! They even tell you when some of these offices are open/closed!!
Now you really have some options in socialling these bastards.

DSN Prefix: 271
NPA : 402

Base Exchange            291.9100
Base Information         294.5900
Base Locator             294.5125
Base Operator            294.1110
Pass and ID              294.0368
Passenger Travel Section 294.5045

Ok, so there's no 0-day but to tell you the truth 0-day is kinda lame.
It imho is used only as a 'haha--look what I can do' boast. I believe
disclosure of just enough information so the reader can exercise is more
important. Anyways, it is a hell of a lot more fun this way anyways. ;)

Net CoreWars: Life to a Sterile Network

Every self-respecting hacker knows CoreWars--the game where you
literally hack up a program to fuck over your opponents in a game later
on, which can be played on a hill (corewars parlance for network game).
One also knows of how various recent worms were spread via bruteforcing
sploits. Well put two and two together and you have one bad ass mother
fucking virus. 

Now of course you might want to start out with something smaller than a
full blown corewars virus but do write it eventually. Ideas might
include:
1) Ping Pong        <--- this is for those of you who have never written
                         network code before
2) Capture the Flag <--- hackers already play this
3) Cops and Robbers <--- a little bit more advanced a.i.
4) CoreWars         <--- the grandaddy fucker

Some ideas on writing your program...
You will probably want to make your sploit and target list into a linked
list instead of an array just because it will be very dynamic and fast.

I don't want to go over on how to actually write the code
as anyone with a couple of hours to spare can just cut/paste the shit
together from a recent worm (however I do advocate writing your own or
at least improving the copies you find). Also, I don't support senseless
vandalism--NOTE: I do support actions against authoritarians though,
like the US government. That's why this is written in sparse
pseudo-code.

int main()
{
   fucking(tobefucked->system);
   //when I wrote a poc for this I had 2 ll's so that I could manage
   //the systems better because in my proggie that information got
   //passed along to the next targeted system so that systems would know
   //what servers were playing a game
   //basically the reasoning behind this is either a) you are going to
   //fuck the systems unconditionally so it doesn't matter if
   //researchers can trace a trail or b) you are writing something
   //stupid so you will be only testing it on a closed network
   //NOTE: a perhaps more efficient way is to just add a flag
   //that says whether or not it is a fucked or a tobefucked system
   //then call a func to test that case
   cleanse_thyself(fucked->system);
   
   //we infect after we cleanse because chances are within a day or so
   //after being released into the wild anti-virus ppl will know what to
   //look for; this way we don't give them time to react
   fucking(infect());
   
   //however, we do wish to keep playing as much as possible ;)
   cleanse_theyself(fucked->system);
   
   //for testing purposes I set the game's max players at 1-8 just
   //because the systems crash too fast
   if(!findgame())
     startgame((char *)0);
   
   //hopefully if you are playing a corewars virus game than you should
   //never get to this last return
   return(0);
}

int playgame() {
    
    /* ptraits == 0 -> personality exists
     * ptraits == 1 -> determine personality
     */
    int ptraits=1;
    
    //now for the a.i. shit
    querysys(); //this func will scan a known system that plays the game
    //for what actions it is taking to be a bold little virus
   
    if(!query_ptraits())
      determineactions(); //in my version I defined a set of
    //characteristics based on d&d stuff that I call ptraits (side
    //research) or personality traits: basically if it had a good/evil
    //inclination, strength, wisdom, etc. you assign a +/-1 to each
    //characteristic when a random action is chosen than once you reach
    //a pre-set number of points you start basing your actions on those
    //ptraits that you developed earlier; this makes it to where you
    //have diff. 'personality' viruses running amok all over the
    //place--it tends to be highly diverse action so anti-viral
    //companies start wondering 'what the fuck!?'
    else
      action();
    //h0h0h0h0...did we just put this into a recursive loop? ;)
    playgame();
    return(0);
}

int determineactions() {
  char *ptraits[num_of_ptraits]="traits go her0n!";
  
  do{
    assignpoint(action())
    traitpoints++;
  } while (traitpoints > num_of_ptraits*num_of_ptraits);  
  
  return(0);
}

char *action() {
  char *ptrait;

  if(query_ptraits()) 
  /* we don't want to reassign the ptraits if they have
  already reached evolution */

  return(ptrait);
}

int query_ptraits()

    else {
      //connect to ip
      fopen("fuckem.cw" "r");
      //read && parse the instructions
      //which could be anything from creating multiple recursive
      //directories to packeting the fuck out of it's neighbors
      //(isolationism) to calling infect() ten times....
      //be creative!
      fclose(fuckem);
      playgame(instructions);
    }  
    return(0);  
} 

int findgame() {
    //a very very crude way that I had used to infect systems
    //involved ftping a text file uuencoded and x0red with a in-system
    //key with a list of previously infected servers; I know you can do
    //better than this so do it!!
    startgame(ip);
    return(0);
}

char *infect() {
    //pick a new system that looks promising
    return(tobefucked->system);
}

int fucking(tobefucked->system) {
   if(!scanfor_0day(tobefucked->system))
     manipulate_traffic_to_be_your_bitch();
   if(hostvuln(tobefucked->system))
     breakin(tobefucked->system);
   else
     fucking(tobefucked->next);
   return(0);
}

Future ideas:
  Port everything to assembly for faster, more efficient, obfuscated
  (yes, many many idiots can't read assembly--the easiest fucking
  language!)
  Add smart network code to target things like oh say .gov, .mil, .us...
  Add smart ptraits that will remember previous actions and act
  accordingly during their personality stage just like their development
  stage

Enum Insecurities and Phucking Shit Up

Enum is setup similiary to the way DNS works right now and therefore is
susceptible to much of the hoobalah that makes dns suck so much.
(use dnssec!!)
....yeh.. that's my bad.. I didn't have time to write a good detailed
article... I write in the next issue but right now go sign up for a enum
number at something like enum.org so you can start experimenting and
learning this new technology. Think convergence of phone, pager, email,
web address, news, etc.
..It's like 3 fucking days till the Sacramento Convergence and that
means I need to obtain a ride now! (come on you fucking detective, do
the math)

##############################
Stop working for the government and stop digesting it's bullshit!!!
If you are a true hacker and don't want to put up with being paid to do
security shit (being a fucking sellout) or you want to quit school
because they don't teach you what you want to know there are
alternatives!!

Shelter:
Start squatting instead of paying to live somewhere. Find an empty
building and setup shop. Need power? Rip some solar panels off the
highway speed control. Need lights? Rip them off the flag spotlights at
schools and public buildings. (incidentally these are perfect for
growing marijuana also) If you get harrassed move to a different place.
It is a good idea to be with several friends or find some because humans
need humans.

Education:
Start reading zines even if you think it will be un-interesting because
you will probably learn something kick ass. Now it is your duty to pass
along information you have learned to someone else.

Food:
Food is plentiful in America. I know in other countries it's not like
that but here in America you can grab a feast every mealtime for free
just by jumping in a dumpster. Most meats are not good to eat from a
dumpster as they are really bad but vegan diets allow you to eat tons of
free stuff. St. Louis Bread routinely dumps a big trashcan bag full of
bread each and every day totally uncontaminated from anything. Most
supermarkets throw out damaged boxes of cereal or whole cases of
soda/beer if they are dented (get drunk for free!!!). Basically as long
as you can drop the mantra of 'if it's in a trashcan it must be bad to
eat' than you will get by fine. This is so overly wrong it is sorry.

Electricity:
This is something I've been working on lately as I'm helping different
squats get started all across North America and the easiest way we have
found is to simply divert power from somewhere else but if you are going
to be in a place for only a couple nights break open the fuse box and
bring power to the mother fucker.
If you read up on Tesla you'll find he was able to draw energy straight
from the Earth by sticking rods into the ground because the Earth acts
like a giant fucking capacitor. I'm in the process of refining this
technology so those of us that need it can use it.
