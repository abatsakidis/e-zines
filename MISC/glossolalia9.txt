SQUEEZE HARD, THE GRIPPED AIR
=============================

     Bear to be born
     Born bare
     Now clothed
     In thought
     Now stare
     Through beer bubbles
     Exhale symbolic noise
     Cross-examination
     Cross-damnation
     Yes, the eyes ate
     Sex flesh, wanton.
     Eye be guilty
     Eye be filthy.
     Eyes see squabbles
     Eyes see the synapse
     Snap
     No more thought
     Crack, light
     ning, crack the
     Neanderthal eye
     Spear the sky
     Kill another guy
     Spout another lie
     Shoulder woman, cry
     Hang head low
     Thunder plunder
     Face grip floor
     Door roar
     Rain tears
     Clouds reverse
     Evaporate
     Dissipate
     Squint, sunlight
     Tear, torn ragged
     Retinal memory.
     Eye be in shards.
     Death dealt the cards.
     Stare
     The open hand
     Grips air
     You are in.

     No longer there.

5 poems from i_strange:meant
============================

     2.

     I consider your cranberry sauce cooked
     notions of food appropriate
     in this *situation* of missing cupboards
     she grinned, shelfing the recipe
     a degree away from its exact
     original location


     -------------------------------------------------------


     3.

     "Saturday night pressure" on
     friday night -- connecting to the invisible
     why meshed with elements
     like grass in cracks in pavement

         who could possibly sustain
     an amorous moment
     of illicit behavior
     suppressed repaginations

     mark separate border styles


     -------------------------------------------------------


     4.

     crammed into such a space
     the patterns match its own immensity --
     complexification through symmetry at odd angles,
     an observer from a unique vantage point



         maybe she was down there on the floor, the ceramic tile,
     squares continuing in both directions. mold in the grout,
     where it grows, a summoning
                   behavior emitted
                   through tranceivers

     what was once thought an approximation
     accumulates in basement drawers --
     the bottom incident will overcome
              and condense
     all howevers pounded
                   as ruptures burst
              not water
                   a pouring
                             of the  molten
     (reflected in her eyes)
                        almost relaxed
     with gained composure
                        from animosity
     a progression along
                        a forecasted linear
     belonging to the proper
                        generation that would fix
     the world's problems
                        (as they saw them)
     through slow rapture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
     . . . . . .. . .
                        pieces falling as curdles
     a vat of milk rich
                        with froth as if

     there were something held back
     something to be missed or being missed
     or Mrs.
         stolid on a grey background
     a pushbutton "alternative" to the
              suburban scene
                        ravished
     here in the city, residential section,
     in the abandoned by the middle class,
     a wreckage of stained oak trim
     and inadequate parking
                        margins supported.


     -------------------------------------------------------


     9.

     with flattened senses, the osity accroachable
         aimed in-to sal vation
         mixed necessity uncertain

     "... I thought that I had lived in a world
     as it was and there were all kinds of
     people in it and I tried to understand
     them, although some of them I could not
     like and some I hated." E.H.

     judgement raynes
                   to be
                        possibly
                                  avoided

     maybe an agreement
         between the disputants

     forge hearing
              certain phrases
                             inadmissable

         lie awkward neck craned
         lift cage door closed

     wait for represenatives
                        code of power
                        manipulation


     -------------------------------------------------------


     9a.

     stories of annihalation
              execution
         by mass-media coverage
              linking nodes
         in an abiotic network

     hallucinations of shape
         and geometry
     fantasies of discernable location
         where fixed points of authority
              collide
         among irreverent
              remote controlled
              personalities

TEXT7.TXT
=========

Included in this file:
---------------------

     Introduction.
     Minimum Requirements.
     Features.
     Fourier Synthesis.
     Drag and Drop.
     Courier New.
     Installing TEXT7.TXT
     Uninstalling TEXT7.TXT
     Distribution.
     Licence.
     Feedback and Support.

Introduction
------------

TEXT7.TXT is a platform independent .txt which is not likely to
achieve very much either for you as end-user or for me as
programmer. It will possibly even crash certain systems (see
Read_Me.1st). TEXT7.TXT is freeware but if you like it and you
want to send me some money I will not stop you. This is the beta
version so send me any bugs you come across.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

A little time. A certain familiarity with software documentation.

Features
--------

I could talk about all manner of wierd and wonderful things at
this point. I could say that this .txt will enable you in some
way or that it will make your life easier. I suppose that that is
possible. We have already established that it is not going to
save you any time. (See Minimum Requirements.) It has little to
recommend it visually. It will look as good in white on a plain
black screen as it would in the latest top of the range text
editor with support for HTML and a script jukebox. If there is
enough interest I may include hypermedia features in a future
version. Edit a component by highlighting or deleting it and
typing something in its place. Obviously I hope that someone
somewhere likes the .txt otherwise I have wasted my time, and
yours, completely.

Fourier Synthesis
-----------------

I have no idea what it is or even what it might be.

Drag and Drop
-------------

If you have Drag and Drop facilities you can drag this .txt to a
folder or dump it straight into the trash can.

Courier New
-----------

The .txt was written in Courier New. Should I ever have a
headstone then it ought to be inscribed using Courier New. I have
often wondered if the use of a particular font affects one's
writing in any way.

Installing TEXT7.TXT
--------------------

The .txt will self-install when the whole of this file is read.
The order in which the sections are read is not important.

Uninstalling TEXT7.TXT
----------------------

Press delete and forget that you ever saw this file.

Distribution
------------

This .txt may be freely distributed. This .txt must not be
distributed in a modified form.  (see Licence).

Licence
-------

The copyright shall remain with the author who takes no
resposibility for any damage of any sort arising from the use of
this .txt. No money may be charged for this .txt in any way
without the consent of the author. Also, it may not be
distributed in any modified form without the consent of the
author.

Feedback and Support
--------------------

If you wish to discuss any aspect of this .txt or you just want
to say Hi then contact the author at the following email address:

Simple Torment
==============

           Torment poured from every chord
           Torment poured from every  wait
          Torment poured from  wait forever
          Torment poured   wait forever and
        Torment  wait forever and you'll see:
     Someone will come and there will be magic,
              But first the torment ...
             pouring from every forever.

News on Prof. Dencker's vispo book

Dencker's Visual Poetry Encyclopedia project is gathering speed.
Dencker has collected a wealth of documents (from more than 800
artists) but is still in need of material to document the current
practice of vispo in China, India, Africa, and the northern and
eastern parts of Europe.

Dencker writes that he's now got an editor in Vienna who wants to
publish the book.

Dencker edited the first German anthology of Visual Poetry, which
was published in 1972 as "Textbilder - Visuelle Poesie
International von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart" (DuMont Verlag,
Cologne).

from Dencker's email (Mon, 18 Nov 1996):

> works of mine you can find under < http://www.zeit.de (> Der
> Zeit-Salon > 1.Internet Literaturwettbewerb 1996 > Alle
> eingesandten Beitraege > Name: Dencker. alain arias-misson/usa

Visual poetry: the 90-ies

Another friendly communication arrived recently from Dmitry
Bulatov, announcing his Visual Poetry anthology project, realized
in co-operation with literary organization "Simplisii",
Kaliningrad State University and literary & art miscellany
"Ojkumena".

>From Bulatov's letter: "The book will be not only the first such
edition in Russia maximally presenting 'the light fractions' of
modern poetry - concrete, semiotic, process, visual and the like
trends, but also will let us to follow current changes of a
historical field of events of art notions of the close of the
century and to reveal the problems which are set by modern
experimental poets."

The anthology will be titled, "Visual poetry: the 90-ies" and is
a companion to Bulatov's "Experimental poetry. Selected articles"
(Koeningsberg-Marlbork, 1996).

The Buda Ray University

I decided to start the Buda Ray University when I got a letter
from Ray Johnson.  He asked me to add to his drawing and return
it to him.

The Buda Ray University is the institution of continuity.

It is a model of a world where everything is in continuous
change, where everything is transformed into various media and
even goes back to the starting point.

Anything is possible in the Buda Ray University.

The Buda Ray University is the medium of collective communication
just like a radio.

The Buda Ray University was founded in 1982 and has had seven
lectures on and exhibitions of the returned works, and has kept
in touch with the cooperating artists.

The Buda Ray University asks you to join it to continue the
project.

Subject: FLUXLIST Standby

An official note to all FLUXLIST subscribers to let you know 1.
that FLUXLIST has been off air for one month now (longer than
original expectations) and 2.  that FLUXLIST has not gone off the
air permanently.  It WILL be back.  Please remain in standby mode.

Scene of the crime:  I had the pleasure today to visit the big
art museum in Weisbaden, Germany, as well as one other local
venue for the 1962, Fluxus performances and events.  I stood on
the stage in the auditorium and spelled "FLUXLIST" with my shoe.
I looked at a piano pushed off in a corner of the stage and
smiled.  Later and quite coincidentally had a telephone
conversation with Ben Patterson (who lives in the Weisbaden area)
and learned that he and Michael Berger are soon to leave for
Namibia to establish the Museum of the Unconscious (or was it The
Subconscious?).

TEXT7.TXT by Krumm has been thoroughly revised for better
compatibility with the standard conversion of MS-DOS filenames.
"TEXT7.TXT" has been substituted for the original version's
"Text7.txt" on all occurrences.  When installing TEXT7.TXT on
Unix systems, a quasi-original version can be obtained with the
perl expression:

     s/TEXT7.TXT/Text7.txt/g;

TEXT7.TXT by Krumm is now recognized as a standard protocol of
[INLINE] poetry and has influenced numerous derivative works by
other on-line poets, and perl programmers.  Thank you for your
support.
