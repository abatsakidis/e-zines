1) marijuana gardening
  Everywhere I go; if I'm going to be in the area for at least a week I
  go out to the forests, deserted fields, or even the mountains and
  plant a garden of cotyleon seedlings. America has been waging war on
  this most beautiful plant for the past century and now is the time to
  help weed fight back. The plant is one of the fastest growing plants
  known. It is used for everything from from non-petrol plastics to
  clothing to food to shelter. It has more cellulose (paper, wood) than
  most trees do and its fibers are better than most synthetically made
  nylons. It has more protein than beans and more beta carotene than
  carrots. That means it will keep you fit and it will improve your
  eyesight. It has improved morale and the sick for centuries. You can
  get heoroin and codeine and other highly addictive, dangerous meds
  from the hospital but they won't let you smoke a joint which will
  actually give immediate direct help? Fuck that shit. Spread the seed
  everywhere you go and help overgrow the government! (btw: I like
  shroom spore syringe juice in water-soakers also, but that's a diff.
  story) So how do you grow marijuana anyway? Well, marijuana is a weed
  so it is extremely easy to grow on it's own. However, since we want
  the bud out of it we are going to try our hardest to make some at
  least decent schwag. First thing you should do is collect some seeds.
  The light grey to dark brown ones are the best. The white ones are too
  premature and the cracked ones will do you no good. Next thing I
  usually do is throw them in water for a day. The ones that float are
  good and the ones that sink suck. This will also collect some water
  for the nutrients locked inside the shell. Next, wrap several (like 10
  or so) seeds in a damp paper towel. Put that on a plate and put another
  plate on top. During this stage, for some reason, the plants don't
  like sunlight. In a couple of days you should see some roots popping
  out. Don't let them grow too long before transplanting otherwise the
  roots will use up all their nutrients too fast. There are literally
  hundreds of soil medium and such to use but we will use a cheap, easy
  setup that will get you growing asap. I have used a 10 gallon bucket
  in the past--the stuff you can find at construction sites. and lined
  the walls with white paper to reflect the light. Then I gathered some
  rocks and then sand than some soil from the yard to line the bucket
  about a little over half way up the bucket. In the soil I added some
  fertilizer--which helps the plant very very much and if you lived in a
  place like oh... Missouri where the soil is acidic as shit from
  limestone and such you almost need it for indoor growing. Next to make
  some breathable soil i cut up some styrofoam take-out boxes that you
  could find at a Chinese restraunt and made a good heterogeneous
  mixture out of that. I turned on two 20 or 30 watt fluorescent light
  bulbs and waited. You will probably see a couple of leaves and an
  initial sprout very fast than there will probably be a period of
  slowdown. Go ahead and feed it some more fertilizer if you want. 8-12
  weeks is the usual vegetative stage followed by at least a couple more
  weeks of flowering--the bud. I like to spray the leaves and wipe
  everything down every couple of days with an extremely light mixture
  of water and ammonia. This helps infections, aphids, and the other
  nasties from fucking with your plant. If your plant grows too long of
  a stem you can either tie it down and let it bush up or stick a stick
  or fork or something in their and tie the plant to it. Basically, take
  care of your plant and treat it like you should treat a dog and they
  in return will treat you nice. For much more advanced growing details
  and the like you might want to visit cannabisculture.com or google.
  
a) n1nj4 smack
  Ever felt the need to lay down the smack on a network but couldn't
  really figure out how you wanted to do it? It's a good thing you found
  the dojo. Now, prepare yourself for enlightenment. Most people will be
  sitting around sniffing and grab a password to a box or maybe they
  found a good leech ftp on a network that is running outdated software
  or whatever. Then they start analyzing traffic on that network and
  setting up clay pigeons on that network until they get all the good
  stuff like the mail servers, the web servers, the firewalls, the
  honeypots, the routers (actually, the grand majority of 'hackers' for
  some reason don't even fuck with the most fun piece of hardware on the
  network), etc. But have you ever felt like something was missing? Ever
  felt like you could and should do much more to a network but just
  didn't have the creative juices flowing? Here are some ideas to
  jumpstart your imagination:
  1) finding other hackers
    Yes! Instead of accidentally bumping into someone why don't you try
    actively looking for your fellow kind? Write a program that sends
    out in plaintext a username/password combo every minute or two
    minutes. In the username/password combo field place an ip address
    and port number to a gateway machine for your own hacker network.
    Or, you could send messages that will end up in log files asking to
    play for machines you can't get into for some reason. (Of course, 
    you can get into any box can't you? ;) )
  2) setup activist consulta partylines
    There are a LOT of people using voip convergence type software now
    like asterix bbs and the like. Why not use these resources for good
    things like setting up partylines for the next upcoming protest or
    something similiar? Why not just say the fuck w/it and keep them up
    as a primary communication resource? All you fone phreaks out there,
    I know have met ma bell on the fone a couple of times and what did
    they say? "Hang up now." hahahah!!! What is a sysadmin going to do
    when or if he finds logs from your communications? Scratch his
    fucking head because the ani from the phreaks on the partyline is
    coming from the whitehouse or a baptist church or the president of
    the company's private office? h0h0h0h0
  3) make it a hacker playground
    Remember all those disclaimers and readmes for the wargames servers
    that have popped up all over the place since Carolyn and her
    fuckfriend Versmaich or whatever the fuck his name is saying that it
    is perfectly legal to 'hack' these boxes and use it for educational
    purposes? No outbound connections and the like? I forgot who you
    are, but I met a friend at the last defcon who was passing out
    hundreds of business cards with a free-for-all wargames server with
    no rules, outbound connections, do what you wish type of game with a
    phat connection. Why not setup a webpage advertising 3 class c
    networks composed of 200 boxen each up for the raping? Tell them the
    truth--that it has a couple of oc-3s coming in and at least a couple
    t3s coming out. Heh! Watch the fun unroll. Of course take it a step
    further and make these permanent. Create gateways to each of them
    and watch the new hacker generation take over the world. If your not
    a hacker and your reading this do you understand us? Do you
    comprehend the power we hold? The only weakness is the will power of
    the underground. They have been whipped into shape for online ethics
    and whimpered into nothing. What happens when you, the reader
    decides to take this own life into her/his own hands? What happens
    when you can make someone else realize that she/he can do the same?
    What happens when those two or more people start banding together in
    the common struggle. Empires meet your doom--the real motha'fuk'n
    hackaz are here.
  
b) breaking free of the engineer mentality
  Engineers are pawns of the corporations. They have smarts but for some
  reason refuse to think for themselves--only for others. Let us examine
  some hacker intruded engineering schemes when it comes to computer
  design.
  For example shared libraries. Engineers thought it would be fucking
  great for the company if they wrote some portable code that is used by
  many different applications. You find this shit all over in every
  operating system now. The problem is that whenever there is a bug or
  something else they update the library and problem solved. Of course,
  if you write a program that depends on the said library your program
  is using code that you do not know about. Sometimes it is extremely
  hard to even get to look at the code without dissassembling it and
  reverse-engineering it. This process takes for fucking ever. Most
  people don't even know this, let alone take the time to look over the
  code in the beginning. So, already you are catering and bowing down
  before some bullshit corporate interest. Understand now why a shit
  load of people love assembly? They don't rely on fucking libraries!
  Programming is like a game for mathematics. You might not realize it
  but there are a shit load of fucking mechancalities involved. The only
  difference, thank those who came before, is that it's not proof based,
  nor is it empirical based--it is based on however the fuck you want it
  to be based upon is. The problem is that a lot of people are engrained
  in the engineer mentality that it is only good for solving a problem,
  rather than being art. Programming for the fuck of it! Programming
  because you love doing it--not because you have to hack something out
  quick and turn it into your boss--not because you know you will make
  money off of it--not because you are seeking fame from writing
  something original--shouldn't everyone be writing original code? Not
  original as in writing a different method to the same problem but
  writing code that does different things; not necessarily a problem at
  all!
  

c) autonomon edere
   So you have a talent for the written word to move people? You have
   bold thoughts that need dissemination but you are stuck in
   fucksville, Idaho? You want to reach millions of people at once but
   don't know how? Come, come.... of course you know how. Enter the
   dprop bot network known as autonomon edere. I know several kids that
   use scripts to automate mass defacements once the boxen are rooted.
   Basically we are just taking this step further and using it for
   propaganda purposes. Also, it allows links to different owned systems
   to view their propaganda and the like. This of course has much more
   potential but an idea that I really haven't had too much time to
   formulate as of yet.
 
  /* we want to pass the file to disseminate */
  int main(int argc, char *argv) {
   char *rooted_b0xen[];
   char *file;
   int i;
   
   file=argv[1];
   
   /*hopefully you have kept a list of rooted b0xen in a file..or you
   ** could modify this program to just pipe it in... eithe way you need
   ** to obtain this list */
   rooted_b0xen=read(file);
   
   for(i=0; i<num_of_b0xen; i++) {
    send(file, rooted_b0xen[num_of_b0xen]); }
   //this will just send an automated text release to sites like
   //textfiles.com, packetstormsecurity.com, neworder.box.sk, and all
   //your friend's submission sites 
   advertise(para, site, file); 
  return(0);
  }

d) v0t3 fucK
 Well, since voting is a piece of shit memetic warfare used against the
 populous I decided it would only be appropriate to use the same offense
 against it. Enter v0t3 fucK. v0t3 fucK is a set of scripts that goto
 blogs, news sites, and other web bbs and develop profiles,
 personalities, etc. to invoke memes that spread like cancer throughout
 with it's intended goal to influence a wide variety of people fast.
 Yes, this uses ptraits (personality traits) once again creating
 character templates for undcov'ah topik agenz! Hell, if we wanted to
 get scientific on the bitch we could even implant some graphs and other
 goodies in the client browser(s) via php injection lameness to show how
 well we are influencing others, what the responses are like, and other
 useful information. So how do we implement it? Easy!

#define NUM_OF_CHARACTERS 20;

//each character starts out with a defined set of traits zeroed out...
//then a random event occurs to distribute a set number of points to
//said traits... once the character is finished generating rulesets are
//used to determine action done by the character
//the ruleset int is a number used to reference what ruleset to use when
//generating data
struct character {
 int name[NUM_OF_CHARACTERS];
 int ruleset;
 int trait1 = 0;
 int trait2 = 0;
 int trait3 = 0;
 //etc ...
};

char *create_ptraits(char *topic); /* define traits for characters */
char *create_data(char *topic, character *); /* create data for
                                                characters */

int main() {
 char *sites[];
 char *characters[];
 char *data[];
 int i;
  
 sites=obtain_sites(topic); //this can be user-inputed or it can do a spider
 //search on the web for relevant sites
 characters=create_ptraits(topic); //we have to map the topic to the traits
 run_rulesets(); 
 question=obtain_question(); //obtain an argument
  
 for(i=0; i<question_num; i++) {
  //this is where we generate questions from our characters
  data=create_data(topic, characters[(rand%num_of_charcs)]);
  //create argument from question
  send(data, rand%sites[num_of_sites]); 
 }
 
return(0);
}

char *create_ptraits(char *topic) {
 int i;
 char *character_array[];
 char *traits[];
 character *bob;
 
 for(i=0; i<num_of_characters_2_gen; i++) {
  //this is simply a referential array with diff. characters of diff.
  //traits that will be passed back to the main loop
  assign_points(character_array[i], bob.);
 }
 return(character_array);
}

char * create_data(char *topic, character *) {
 char *argument;

 lookup_rules(character);
 return(construct_argument(characters));
}

e) hacker wars or why our scene is dying??
 I remember sometime in the early 90s when the FBI, CIA, etc. et al.,
 were cracking down on hackers because bbs' were getting highly popular
 and they were usually filled to the brim with insurrectionist,
 anarchist material. After that no one really heard too much about
 hacker wars unless it was confined to places like irc or web
 defacements. Therefore the corporations and the state were free from
 hackers fucking their shit up everytime an ego got to big and since
 hacker culture is built upon ego...
 How do we fix this sorry state of affairs? There are a number of ways
 anyone could come up with. However, we are looking at the extinction of
 our culture, our way of life, and our well being. We are looking at
 either life or death. Thus we must contend that we either fight or we
 die like the dinosaurs. Corporations have no qualm about killing a
 group's culture, let alone them. Look at Monsanto with it's unholy
 alliance with Dynacorp that spray Columbia plants with a highgrade crop
 killer that also deforms babies, induces chronic diseases, and destroys
 the farmers life. Look at Microsoft that has prevented very
 successfully a diverse group of computer technology (both hardware and
 software) from sprining up in the US. No, the question you must ask
 yourself is whether or not you will fight for yourself or be
 assimilated like the rest. Basically, the more chaos and confusion we 
 can cause as hackers the more we will have to innovate and leave the
 hapless weak willed behind in the dust. We need the outlaw image that
 the media likes to portray because things will only get worse until
 they get better. This is the truth. Stagnation will result in death.
 Metamorphisizing seizes life and shoots ftl through the beyond. So let's
 jump aboard the chaos theory bandwagon and fuck shit up! Here are some 
 suggestions:
 0: create an automated distributed troll script that uses linguistic
 pattern matching to produce highly favorable trolls on web forums
 0: start writing destructive office memos for every office win* network
 you find asking employees to executing trojaned scripts that blame the
 results on a competing group
 0: start linking wargame servers together via bridges and gateways and
 let everyone know that no computer, no router, no phone, no blackberry
 device, no fucking coffee pot is safe from us hackers, of the net.
 0: since wardriving is popular, start using it for more than free net
 access--I know several banks that I've seen when I go out driving that
 have passwordless 802.11 networks with bullshit like access and other
 crappy software doing their accounting info--so what the fuck are you
 waiting for!? write a scrambler and start fucking that account info up!
 0: it's time hackers started leaving the hack computers/code only
 paradigm and shifted into hacking everything! who says you can't hijack
 a cell fone conversation from some bigshot ceo and amplify it outwards
 to every receiver available? Tesla can... and he died over 40 years
 ago!
 
f) introducing silicybin
 Silly human, computers and networks are for hackers! Introducing
 silicybin, the utility that your friend would have given you head for
 life if it wasn't open-source. Silicybin is a three-part set of
 programs. It is a parasitie that uses resources on an array of zombie
 hosts for storing files, communicating with friends, and having all the
 anemities of a regular network but it is entirely parasitical. Basically 
 you have three components for this thing. You have the zombies which 
 obviously connect to the central daemon and do all the backbreaking work
 of forwarding packets, sending communications and the like. Those on the
 a-list are people using your network. The a-list client is a program
 that goes into the background and accepts connections on a certain port
 to forward communications to the vps/vpn. The master control program is
 a ncurses based program that allows control over the entire network. If
 this is compromised all shit breaks loose. For each a-list client and
 zombie, in the packet header there is a signed key that is transmitted
 so that spurious communications may not occur. Changing the encryption
 for the key is vital and protects your communications. Remember, that
 this information is encapsulated again in regular tcp/ip traffic so
 someone would have to write their own client and have your keys to
 submit false traffic. Only then can they start spoofing shit. There is no 
 tunneling allowed so that everyone must be a confirmed user on the 
 a-list. The daemon and the a-list/zombie clients should be allowed to
 have modules so that unforseen options can be added later on. To allow
 access from other parts of the net gateways should be added that allow
 regular ipv4/ipv6 traffic to gain access to the vpn/vps. Sentinels will
 guard the gateways and act as autonomous bots that look for ne'er doers
 and wage war on them from the vps. Spurious traffic will accumulate to
 hide the real traffic which will be encrypted via a shared key. Here is
 some of the pseudo code:

g) getting drunk off of the h0n3yp0tZ
  You know how to make homemade beer? No? Why the fuck not? It's cheap
  or free, depending on how you obtain your ingredients and within a
  couple months you too can be rolling drunk off your ass till your next
  batch is done. So, what the fuck is the point you say? The point,
  dexter, is that sugar or honey is one of the essential ingredients in
  alcohol. Yeast is the other. The yeast feeds off of the sugar and when
  not exposed to oxygen it creates alcohol.
  This will be our basic premiss behind the proof of concept program,
  yeast. Yeast uses the honeypot against the owner by hiding files in
  the honeypot's client logs and using the regex pattern matching of the
  honeypot to snatch lan traffic such as passwords and emails. But this
  is only a couple of it's capabilities sire! We can harass via logs and
  spoof so-called honeytokens into giving access to ourselves the easy
  way. Hrm... not following my drunken ass are you?--well then, let me
  re-explain. When a honeypot is trying to capture traffic it logs
  pretty much fucking everything. We take advantage of this fact to hide
  files on the target system. With a little ingenuity a trojan can be
  placed on any system without the target owner knowing shit. It can
  also be used to send spurious data to throw the honeypots into a
  quagmire. (fuck those memetic words) let's look at some pcode as that
  should be easier to understand:

  int main() {
   do {
     selectchoice(fill_up_logs);
     selectchoice(hide_data);
     selectchoice(be_a_bitch); //this is my favorite cause you turn the
     //honeypot into your workhorse...say there is a honeytoken for a
     //recent exploit that uses the string /bin/sh...if you send data
     //out that has /bin/sh in it the logs will look for data coming
     //from that ip/port pair more--let's not stop there..what if that
     //string /bin/sh is really a link to a program on that port that
     //sends out an arp poision atttack to the local router? the
     //limitless choices are in abundance here ladies and gentlemen
     selectchoice(scan_for_traffic);
     selectchoice(trojan); } while(1);
   return(0);
   }

   /* this is the most easiest util because at it's core is just a
   ** simple d0s util..we just want to make sure the honeypots are
   ** collecting enough info..so we send out hotstrings and other data
   ** very rapidly and we send a shit load of it! */
   void fill_up_logs() {
     collect_hot_strings(); //find out what the hotstrings are from
     //something like packetstormsecurity.com
     while(1) {
      string=(strings[(rand%NUM_OF_STRINGS_COLLECTED)]);
      ip=(rand%256);
      port=(rand%65536);
      send(string, ip, port, target);
   }

   //this func will need to be finetuned to diff. honeypot systems...
   //perhaps an array where each system can be identified and then
   //matched as to where the data should be put... for instance if you
   //have one honeypot throwing shit into /var/log/honeypot.log that
   //will be a diff. case then some homebrew bullshit that is putting it
   //in /root/I'm_not_a_dumbass.log (you'd be surprised at this type of
   //shit that exists--thank god the american military machine has
   //partnered with lance...heh! dumbasses) 
   void hide_data() {
     data=select_data();
     ncrypt_data(data);
     ip=(rand%256);
     port=(rand%65536);
     send(data, ip, port, target);
   }

   //get your creativity on!
   void be_a_bitch() {
   }

   //this just sets tokens in the logs to traffic found to be
   //interesting; an offsite approach to capturing traffic on a network
   //that you might not have access to or at least not very long
   void scan_for_traffic() {
     char *scanned_traffic;

     //a very trivial example
     scanned_traffic= sniff_network();
     place_tokens(scanned_trafic);
