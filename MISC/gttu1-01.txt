============================================================

AGT SEEKS RATE INCREASE: AGT Limited is asking the CRTC for 
an interim increase in local rates, effective February 1. 
The company says that without higher rates, its 1996 Utility 
segment Rate of Return will be only 2%. The requested 
increase is in addition to the $2/month rate hike ordered by 
the CRTC on October 30. 

BELL vs. INTERNET PROVIDERS: Internet Service Providers 
across Ontario and Quebec are protesting a Bell Canada 
decision that will raise prices paid for network access. On 
Bell's recommendation, many ISPs had installed Centrex 
lines. Now the telco says they must use Information System 
Access Lines (ISALs) instead, at triple the price.

** For our view of the dispute, see "Bell Canada vs.
   Internet Service Providers: A Review of Facts and 
   Issues," an analysis paper by Ian Angus. It's on our
   Website: http://www.angustel.ca/isp-bell.html

TELEGLOBE OKAYS COMPETITION, IF... : Teleglobe Canada says 
it won't ask for an extension on its overseas telecom 
monopoly, which is due to expire in 1997. In return 
Teleglobe wants deregulation of overseas prices, an easing 
of rules limiting foreign and telco ownership, and a bar 
against Stentor members entering the overseas market for an 
unspecified time. 

** Teleglobe's statement: http://www.Teleglobe.ca/en/ 

KEDAR PLANS OVERSEAS CARRIER: Mike Kedar, founder of Call-
Net, has announced plans to launch an overseas 
communications company to compete with Teleglobe. GeoReach 
Telecommunications Inc. will act as a carriers' carrier.

PRIVATE CASH CARDS? The Mondex cash card system, sponsored 
in Canada by Bell Canada, the Royal Bank and CIBC, will get 
its first test soon in Guelph, ON. "Cash" is transferred 
onto the cards at ATMs or special telephones and off the 
cards to a merchant's terminal -- a supposedly anonymous 
transaction. But a complaint filed in the UK says that 
Mondex, in fact, can trace all transactions made with each 
card.

SASKTEL TRIES VOICE DIALING: SaskTel is testing 
VoiceConnect, a service which allows customers to call 
businesses by speaking the company name. The companies pay a 
monthly charge of about $20 plus usage fees ranging to 20 
cents/call. 

** Nortel on VoiceConnect: http://newswire.flexnet.com/
   month12/message/nov1995/c11456.htm

ROGERS OFFERS INTERNET ACCESS: Rogers Communications is now 
offering Cablelink, a home Internet access service, in 
Newmarket ON. $39.95/month gets you a cable modem and 
unlimited use. One-time set-up is $100. A system-wide roll-
out is planned for 1996.

MODERATING THE HIGHWAY: Recently, the Internet newsgroup 
can.infohighway has been deluged by off-topic messages, 
overwhelming discussion of the topics the group was created 
for. In response, several participants have proposed that 
all messages be screened by a moderator before they are 
posted. Discussion of this proposal is now taking place in 
the groups can.infohighway and can.config.

ALLIANCE ON COMMUNICATION POLICY FORMED: The Alliance for a 
Connected Canada aims to defend Canadian content, 
employment, and the availability to all essential services. 
Its founders include the Council of Canadians, the 
federation of Quebec consumer groups, and the 
Telecommunications Workers Union.

DUAL MODE WIRELESS TESTED: Business Link, now being field 
tested by Bell Mobility, provides wireless phones that 
connect to a customer PBX, with free airtime, while on site. 
They convert to regular cellular service when taken off the 
premises.

TOLL FREE INTERNET FOR REMOTE LOCATIONS: The Internet 
Outpost Network, a package of Internet services via 
satellite, is being offered by Canadian Satellite 
Communications (Cancom) for businesses in small and remote 
communities.

BELL OFFERS TELECOM GLOSSARY: A pocket-size bilingual 
glossary of some 400 telecommunications and computer-related 
words is available from Bell Canada for $20. Explanations of 
Bell's products are included. Orders can be placed at Bell 
Canada's Website:

** http://www.bell.ca/bell/eng/products/glosform.htm.

TELULAR SALES UP: Telular Canada says sales for the three 
months ending September rose to $2.0 Million, six times last 
year's level.

CABLE COMPETITION NEARS: The CRTC says that it will no 
longer prohibit Cable-TV companies from competing in each 
other's territory. The prohibition will not usually appear 
in new or renewed licenses -- and current licensees may 
apply to have it removed.

TELEMANAGEMENT ANALYZES SPLIT RATE BASE DECISION: What did 
the CRTC decide? Why are the telcos unhappy? Was "US 
Benchmarking" worthwhile? Read all about it in 
TELEMANAGEMENT #130, published this week. Also: area code 
chaos, numbering plan changes, virtual network rates, 
reinventing telecom management. For a detailed Table of

BULLETIN:

BELL CANADA TO NEGOTIATE SOLUTION
WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS

November 21: Bell Canada has agreed to work with Internet 
Service Providers to develop new services and tariffs for 
the ISP environment.

Late yesterday afternoon, Don Morrison, Bell's Group Vice 
President for Local Services Marketing and Sales, faxed a 
letter to several Toronto-area ISPs. Morrison wrote, in 
part:

   "We will work with the CRTC to help them understand that 
   Bell Canada does not consider the existing Centrex 
   tariff nor the ISAL tariff to apply to the ISP 
   application....

   "Bell Canada proposes to continue applying Centrex III 
   rates for new and existing services until a new 
   alternative is developed."

This reverses Bell's previous position that the Internet 
Service Providers must pay the ISAL rate for their incoming 
telephone lines. That would have resulted in billing 
increases of as much as 300% for the ISPs. Bell was willing 
to delay the increase on existing lines for six months, but 
intended to charge the ISAL rate for all new lines. On 
November 16, the ISPs asked the CRTC to overrule Bell.

Morrison's letter asks the ISPs to "join us to work on the 
development of new alternatives to be filed with the CRTC by 
November 30th." November 30 is the CRTC-set deadline for 
Bell to reply to the ISP Appeal.

We will continue to report on this question in regular 
weekly issues of TELECOM UPDATE, and we are planning a 
feature article on the dispute for the next issue of 
TELEMANAGEMENT.

affordability of local phone service to low-income
customers. The public hearing will begin in Hull April 15;
those wishing to take part must notify the CRTC by December
19 and file written submissions by January 19.

** The text of the CRTC's notice is available at
   http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/telecom/notice/files/p9549.txt.

BELL AND ISPs BEGIN DISCUSSIONS: As we reported in Telecom
Update's Special Bulletin last week, Bell Canada announced
on November 20 that it wants to work with Internet Service
Providers to develop a new service specifically designed for
them. Angus TeleManagement's Ian Angus has agreed to act as
a third-party facilitator in the discussions. The
participants hope to have a preliminary description of
the new service prepared for submission to the CRTC on
November 30.

** Our Website now includes a special section on the Bell-
   ISP dispute, including Ian Angus's reports on the
   negotiations. See: http://www.angustel.ca/isp-bell.html

BELL SUBSIDIARIES TO LAUNCH INTERNET SERVICE: BCE
subsidiaries Bell Sygma and Worldlinx say that on November
29 they will launch an Internet service "designed with
families and small businesses in mind," which will "make it
easier than ever for Canadians to find the information they
want most on the Internet." More details next week.

CALL-NET CHALLENGES UNITEL BUYOUT: Call-Net, Sprint Canada's
parent company, has asked the CRTC to rule that Unitel
cannot continue to operate as a Canadian carrier. Call-Net
says that the Unitel buyout agreement between AT&T and three
Canadian banks, announced in September, violates the foreign
control provisions of the Telecom Act.

BROADCAST OWNERSHIP RULES TO BE LIBERALIZED: The federal
cabinet has agreed to loosen foreign ownership rules for
Canadian broadcasters and cable companies, to allow foreign
investors to own up to 1/3 of a holding company's voting
shares. This will harmonize the ownership rules in the
Broadcasting Act and the Telecommunications Act, a measure
recommended in October by the Information Highway Advisory
Council.

COMPETITORS OPPOSE BC TEL'S REVIEW REQUEST: Sprint, Unitel
and Westel told the CRTC last week that BC Tel's stated
grounds for appealing its 1995 contribution rates are
without foundation.

TELCO BOND RATINGS CUT: Canadian Bond Rating Service has
downgraded the bonds and preferred shares of Bell Canada,
AGT, BC Tel and MT&T, citing a significant decline in
financial performance.

RESIDENTIAL ISDN OKAYED: The CRTC has given interim approval
to Bell Canada's proposed Residential Microlink (ISDN 2B+D)
service. Rates are $51-$57/month, plus $1.00/hour for usage
between 7am and 7pm. At the CRTC's request, Bell added a
usage cap, so that the total monthly cost cannot exceed the
cost of a flat-rate business Microlink line. Residential
Microlink will be available December 1; the usage-billing
component will not be implemented until March.

BUSINESS ISDN CHANGES COMING: We have learned that Bell
Canada will soon ask for major changes to its Business
Microlink service. The proposed tariff, to be filed this
month, will remove Microlink from the Centrex tariff and
eliminate the 1B+D version. Customers will be given a choice
between usage sensitive service ($50/month plus $1.00/hour)
and flat-rate service ($130-$150/month).

CALL FOR CANADIAN ISDN USERS' GROUP: Anyone interested in
helping to form a users' group to support ISDN technology in
Canada should e-mail isdn@telco.on.ca or contact Vance
Shipley, 416-410-5475 (voice) or 519-884-9017 (fax).

TELEZONE SIGNS $300 MILLION AGREEMENTS: Memorandums of
understanding with Nortel and AT&T cover building the first
stage of TeleZone's national wireless network, if TeleZone
wins a 1.9 GHz national PCS license.

ALPHANET PLANS UNIFIED MESSAGING BY INTERNET: AlphaNet
Telecom of Toronto, which runs the 10-country InnFax
network, is seeking strategic partners to implement its
UniPost technology for unified fax, data and voice messaging
via the Internet.

CANADA TRUST OFFERS ACCOUNT INFO BY INTERNET: Customers
using Canada Trust's phone banking system can now get
account balances and transaction histories at Canada Trust's
website, http://www.canadatrust.com.

NUMBER PORTABILITY WORKING GROUP FORMED: In a bid to hasten   
the arrival of local telephone competition, the CRTC has    
announced a "working group" to examine technical,    
administrative and regulatory issues related to local number  
portability. In Telecom Public Notice 95-48, the Commission   
says it wants to have an interim solution operating by early  
1997. All federally-regulated telcos are ordered to    
participate; other organizations wishing to take part must    
notify the CRTC by November 24. The first meeting of the    
working group will take place on December 7.   
   
** CRTC's Public Notice on portability:    
   http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/telecom/notice/files/p9548.txt   
   
INTERNET PROVIDERS APPEAL BILL INCREASE: Seven Internet    
Service Providers have filed an appeal against Bell Canada's  
plan to charge them for Information System Access Lines    
(ISALs) instead of standard Centrex lines -- a change which   
increases their line rates by as much as 300%. The    
application, submitted to the CRTC on November 14, asks the   
CRTC to rule either that the ISAL tariff does not apply to    
ISP services, or that the ISAL tariff is discriminatory and   
therefore invalid.   

** For our view of the dispute, see Bell Canada
   versus Internet Service Providers: A Review of 
   Facts and Issues, by Ian Angus, at our website
   (http://www.angustel.ca).
   
AGT RATE HIKE DETAILS ANNOUNCED: If AGT's proposal is    
approved, local service rates in Alberta will increase on    
February 1. Residence lines, which now cost between $11.98    
and $13.98 a month, would go to $19.98/month for all    
subscribers. The range for business lines, now $22.43 -    
$62.08 a month, would be $30.43 - $66.08 a month. November  
27 is the deadline for public comment on the application.  
   
BC TEL SEEKS HIGHER CONTRIBUTION FEES: BC Tel has asked the   
CRTC to "review and vary" its Decision 95-21. The telco  
wants 1995 contribution fees, paid by BC long  distance  
providers, to be set at 5.04ข, instead of 4.49ข as ordered 
by the Commission. BC Tel contends that the CRTC 
overestimated 1995 long distance traffic and made 
calculation errors. November 21 is the deadline for 
public comment on the application.  
   
THIRD BID FOR DIRECT-TO-HOME TV: Shaw Communications and    
several other cable companies (but not Rogers) have asked    
the CRTC to licence a direct-to-home satellite television    
service called Homestar. Projected start date: September    
1996. The other two DTH contenders are Power DirecTV and    
ExpressVu.   
   
AT&T OFFERS BUYOUTS TO 78,000 MANAGERS: Half of AT&T's    
managers received a severance proposal last week; those who   
do not take the package must submit resumes for a staffing    
decision early next year. By one report, AT&T may cut 20,000  
of its 302,000 employees in this round.   
   
** For AT&T's statement on the offer, see:

FONOROLA PROVIDES ELECTRONIC PHONE BILLS: Using Fonorola's    
Billmaster service, customers can analyze their bill on a    
PC, specifying criteria and generating corresponding    
reports. Fonorola sends diskettes monthly by courier --   
free to accounts above $1,500/month; other customers pay    
$35/month. The software, supplied without charge, is from  
Datex Communications in Oakville, Ont.   
   
FONOROLA DEBT OFFERING: Fonorola aims to issue US$100    
Million in secured notes in order to pay off existing debts   
and fund future fiber expansion. The notes will not be sold   
in Canada.   
   
DIGITAL CELLULAR HAZARD: Health Canada has warned that    
digital cellular phones can interfere with pacemakers if  
operated within six inches of the device. Pacemaker users  
are advised to hold the phone to the ear opposite the  
pacemaker and to avoid carrying the phone in shirt or jacket  
pockets.   
   
QUEBEC SCHOOLS TO GO ON THE NET: As part of its Beacon    
Information Highway Project, Bell Canada has announced a $5   
Million plan to link more than 2,000 Quebec schools to each   
other and to the Internet. The pace of the rollout will be    
up to local school boards.   
   
ERICSSON, AGRA SUPPORT CANTEL EXPANSION: AGRA    
Industries, a Canada-based engineering firm with 5,000    
employees, has formed a strategic alliance with Ericsson,    
the Swedish telecom giant. Their first project: equipment    
and systems for the Rogers Cantel network, which will  
increase its digital cell site locations by more than 40%.   
   
MTS CUTS STAFF BY 5%: Forty-five Manitoba Telephone    
employees were laid off November 14; 176 others had

                        Ye Olde Beige Box

                        By Dr No


        What is the beige box you ask??  Well to put it simply, it is a
linesmans test set.  It is a phone that is easily connected to the outside of
a house, or a phone pole in order to test if the line is working properly. Can
you say ANAC???  Obviously, we can do the same thing with ease.  This is so
easy that most little kids could do it, although they would most likely end
up with orange hair because of the electric shock. Oh, well.  Anyways, the
idea behind this is that you take a touch tone phone and hook it up to the
outside of a house. I will tell more as this goes on....

        While, fooling with telephone wires and (good) stuff like that, my
good (elito) friend and I figured a very easy way for hooking up an extra
phone jack.  Obviously, this is very easy, so dont bother telling me so.
After this, we looked at each other and thought "Damn, this is so easy I bet
we could do the same thing to another persons house!"  Well, this thought was
exciting.  So, the next evening, we dressed in black (hehe) and went to an
unidentified house, and searched around.  We found two boxes with "Telephone"
on them.  The first, a small black box, and the second, a small grey box.  We
opened both, and we found that the black box had the most possibilities.  With
flashlight in hand, we noticed that it had all four telephone wires (red,
green, yellow, and black).  Since we had hooked up our other phone jack to
wires like these, we thought "Heh, this is easy!"  Now for the process:

        Now, you need a few things:

        - a standard out-of-wall jack(I ferget the name!!)
        - a standard touch-tone phone, with the tele. cord
        - some aligator clips (2)
        - telephone wire
        - wire strippers

        The first step is to set up your jack.  All you have to do, is use
the tele-phone wire and set it up normally.  Now, make sure you have some
excess wire, so you can cut some.  Use, the wire strippers, first for the
outer telephone wire, then for the red and the green wires.  You should have
good inch or 1/2 inch of copper wire.  Take the alligator clips and attach
them to the ends of the red and green wire.  You might want to use some super
glue to make sure that they stick.  Last, Take your touch-tone phone, with
telephone cord, and get dressed in black(hehe) or whatever you prefer to ware.
        
       For this next step, you should know and understand that trespassing
is illegal, and that stealing phone calls from another person is illegal.  So
I cant be blamed for any illegal activity that you might do!! Take this
seriously!!!  Anyway, when you go, search for a small black box.  It should
be able to be opened.  Look for the red and green wires.  Hook the alligator
clips to their respective places, and you are ready.  Plug your touch-tone
phone into the jack.  If you hear a dial-tone, then you are set, if you dont
then just adjust the wiring.  It should work, not matter what. Make your calls
and then get out of there!


        Here are some tips for the beige boxer:


 - Dress in clothing with big pockets, to hold your tools

 - Bring these tools(recommended):
        a pocket flashlight
        small phillips screwdriver
        extra telephone cord

 - Bring a list of phone numbers you wish to call, therefore, you won't be
   stuck with a bad memory...

 - Ware gloves that will protect you from shock...this is VERY helpful!

 - Make a clean and non-suspicious getaway.  This is key, considering the
   consequences...


       Most of these "Helpful Hints" have come from past experience.  I have
gone through: almost getting caught to very, very numb fingers.  Such as one
time(it was my second time boxing) I fergot my phone list.  So, stupidly(err
very stupidly) left my stuff still outside, all set up.  The people must have
tried to use the phone, and when I came back. Oh Sh*t...Where is my stuff, I
thought!  All of my stuff was gone.  Yet did not have time to think about it
considering there were like voices coming from the front of this house.  I
ran faster than an antelope! I laugh about it now, but who knows where my
stuff is.  Another little anecdote I have is, one time, I kept try'n to set
the wires straight and I kept gettin shocked.  I could hardly move my hands
at the end, when leaving.  It suxored bad!!  From then on, I started using
either shock protected tools or gloves.  What ever I can get.  


        Now I understand that this way of beige boxing is mainly from the
'80's, but still it works.  There are other, newer ways of beige boxing.  More
Hi-tech ways, like using a charged base.  This option will allow you to be
farther away from the actual box, therefore resulting in a lesser chance to
get caught.  I feel this is a very good way, but I am not familiar with it.
Maybe someone would like to fill us in.  Also, there are different add-ons
you can do with my type of beige boxing.  One thing is to use a duplex jack.
This is quite obvious (and an insult to your intelligence) Another thing, is
to set up a box like the lunch box(transmitter/reciever).  This new box would
allow you to record, phone out, and listen in to a phone! I may try and work
on this, but everyone else is welcome to do the same.  I feel that this box
(if not already out) would be very useful.  So, as you can see, the beige
box has many options.  You should try and explore them, I know that I will.


Thanx to Dr Shmoo and ReDragon for the help....

                HACKING MERIDIAN MAIL VMB'S PART II

[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]
                                DISCLAIMER
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

Since I don't like disclaimers I won't put the usual shit in them.
I don't want to say this text is for informational purposes only, but I do
want to say this: Don't unnecessary annoy the normal VMB users, or extremely
abuse the outdial functions, it's immoral (hahahahaha).



[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]
                               INTRODUCTION
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

OK then... In may I allready wrote a textfile on meridian mail systems.
Now, 6 months later, I found out lots of phun things about this very nice
system, and decided my old text needed a good update, so here it is.



[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]
                      IDENTIFYING A MERIDIAN MAIL VMB
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

It's VERY HARD to identify a Meridian Mail system, when you call a VMB and
hear a womans voice saying 'Meridian Mail....mailbox' then you found one.
(Phew, this was hard (hehe)). Anyway, it isn't always this easy-to-recognise
welcome message. Other ways to know for sure that you're dealing with
Meridian Mail is that when you don't enter a box number after about 5 seconds
it will say 'Please enter your mailbox followed by number sign'. After you've
entered the 4-digit mailbox number, it will ask 'password'.
A lot of times you won't be directly at the logon-prompt, so you'll first
have to find a way to get to that prompt. So far I only found one meridiam
mail you can't access from an outside line, so I guess that's really an
exception. To access it, try typing different things like 81 (logon), 0, #81,
1#, 10#,... In some cases you will get a menu after the VMB answered stating
like 'press 1 to leave a message... press 2 to logon...' in such a case you
press whatever the message says to logon ofcourse.



[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]
                            FINDING A VALID BOX
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

Even when the box you entered is not valid, the system will ask for a
password. The boxes are 4 digits, and usually grouped in blocks. I suggest
that you first try these box-numbers: x000,xxxx,xy00. On allmost all vmb
systems I've found valid, hackable boxes with these 'templates'. I think they
usually set up boxes like 1000, 6666, 2600, 9800,... for testing purposes, or
when they're used by many people, and the number has to be easy to remember.
On all Meridian Mail systems I found, the default password was the same as
the box number. I haven't found system administrator boxes yet, but I think
they're probably located as on other vmb systems (ex: 9999,9000,...).
However, it might be possible that there aren't any system administrator
boxes because Meridian Mail is controlled by an IBM compatible, with a special
card to control the phonelines and recognise DTMF tones and so on, a HUGE
harddisk to store all those messages, and a soundblaster. HOWEVER, I'm NOT
sure about this. Someone told me that he found the dialup for such a system,
but I don't know if he was telling the truth or just bullshitting.
Also, if someone can get me the name or telephone number from the company
that manufactures Meridian Mail, I'd be extremely thankfull.



[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]
                           WHEN YOU FOUND A BOX
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

Don't change anything in it, use the one you found to scan for other unused
boxes. I'll explain how to scan for them later. I would say don't listen to
the messages, because then the legit owner (if there is one) could be warned,
but hey, I like to listen to other peoples bullshit too, so... (I once had a
box from a woman, and two different guys used to call her a couple of times a
day saying that they missed/wanted her, and stuff like that (Belgians: it was
on the JD fuckin' EDWARDS system)).
NOW, the MOST important thing (in my humble opinion)... Try if it allowes
outcalling. Press 0*, you will here a message, then try any of the following
numbers:

          9+local number+#   (ex: 95551212#  -> dir. assistance)
          9+0+local number+# (ex: 905551212# -> dir. assistance)
          9+1+local number+# (ex: 915551212# -> dir. assistance)

          8+local number+#   (ex: 95551212#  -> dir. assistance)
          8+0+local number+# (ex: 905551212# -> dir. assistance)
          8+1+local number+# (ex: 915551212# -> dir. assistance)

          9+ACN+#   (ex: 93054439903#)
          9+1+ACN+# (ex: 913054439903#)
          8+ACN+#   (ex: 83054439903#)
          8+1+ACN+# (ex: 813054439903#)

          9+011+cc+nr+# (ex: 90113238252274# to reach Sin City)

          !!! USE YOUR IMAGINATION !!!

These are the 'templates' I have used, except for the 8+blah which I heard
from someone that had used it. It's quite possible that other 'templates'
also work, just try everything you can think of, meridian mail outdials will
'last' several months.



[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]
                              MAILBOX OPTIONS
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

0* : Outcalling !!!

 * : get info about what you're doing, and all available options.

 2 : play message
 4 : goto previous message
 6 : goto next message
 9 : call the sender of the message

70 : message options
71 : reply to the message you've just listened to
72 : play envelope : hear all info about the message
73 : forward the message to another box
74 : record one reply for all messages
75 : record a message (5 to start, # to stop recording)
76 : delete the actual message
79 : send message

80 : mailbox options.
     1 : change operator assistance number
         This will change the number that is called when you enter 0
         for operator assistance. These numbers are usually other box
	 numbers, but I found a systems which will connect me to some
         local prefixes too.... might be interesting.
81 : logon to another mailbox
82 : change the internal and external greeting of your box
     1 : change internal greeting
     2 : change external greeting
     Don't do this, or you'll lose your box very fast...	
83 : logoff
84 : change password (enter new pw + #)
85 : create a distribution list
     !!! This option can be used to scan for other unused/valid boxes.
     Just enter 5 to compose a new distribution list, and then enter the
     box number followed by #. Note down boxes that respond with
     'mailbox xxxx' because they're unused, and I still have to find such
     an unused box that hasn't got the box number as password. When you
     found enough unused boxes, press ## to stop your distribution list,
     and then 76 to delete it.
86 : goto message #. This option will ask for the number from a message,
     end then go to that message (like you could by using 4 and 6).
89 : personal verification (will say name of owner)
     5 : record name
     4 : exit

Well, those were the most important commands. Remember that you can allways
get help by pressing *.

                    SCANNING FOR BOXES USING YOUR MODEM
[-]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[-]

Well, since I'm a VERY lazy person I like to write scan programs for anything
I'd normalle have to press numbers on my phone for... So I also made some
to scan Meridian Mail systems. The first one is written in MicroSoft Basic
(yeah, I know it's lame, but who needs lightning speed for a scan program ?),
and will only work if after a toll free number hangs up you get a busy-tone
in your country/city/area/whatever. In Belgium when you call a tollfree
number you'll get a busy tone when it hangs up. So what this program
basically does is dial the Meridian Mail dialup, wait for a while, and
then starts sending 3 times a random 4-digit number with the same number
as a password, each time followed by #. Because this probably isn't clear,
here's an example:

First I send f.e.: ATS8=4D<VMB dialup>,,,;
Now my program checks for 'OK'
Then it sends f.e.: ATS8=1 (1 is enough and quicker)
                    ATDT2789#,2789#,7765#,7765#,2112#,2112#

Now when any of these numbers was correct, your modem will return a
'NO CARRIER'. Otherwise you'll get a 'BUSY'.
I know in some countries you get a dialtone when a tollfree number hangs up,
so you can check by using 'W' for a dialtone, and if it says 'NO DIALTONE'
you found a box !

The second method goes as follows: 
Do exqctly the same as with the first method, BUT after sending the
second dialstring, send a third one containing the following:
ATDT0*,,0#
This will start the outcalling option, and call the operater, which will
ALWAYS give at least one 'RING', so you need to have a modem than can detect
RING's, and have to enable that option. So, if you detect a RING, then you
found a valid box, and you can hangup. Otherwise if you haven't detected a
RING after about 5 seconds, hangup, you haven't found a valid box.

To this 2 methods there's one disadvantage: if the first or second box you
try is valid, AND the next box(es) contain(s) an option in their digits
(like 81 or 83) then it might be possible you won't detect the valid box.
However, using this method I found boxes on several Meridians, and Freud
has also used it with success.

                        Aol Hate Mail
                        an anonymous submission



        The other day, I was on irc, and some idiot started fuxering up the
channel.  He scrolled and said stupid stuff.  I did a /whois on 'em and I
found out that he was on AOL.  Geez...whats new.  Many people on irc have
experienced this and most hate it.  I just cant understand why someone would
want to scroll or say stupid things.  Just stay mellow.  Hang out, and learn
from other guys.  If you think you are god, and others on AOL think you are
god, twenty bucks says you have a long way to go.  You will realize this if
you just wait, before you scroll, and just listen in, or ask a question.  We
can learn together (enuff of the 'why cant we all just get along?' shit).  So
anyway, to all you AOLers:  Either chill out or get out!  And if you are cool
and are on AOL, no offense.  I just had to write the article.  Later...

                        Phreaking 101
                        by Dr No



        In each issue, I will be teaching phreaking and doing updates about
certain phreaking topics.  This will hopefully help not only the beginners,
but also give the veterans a tip or two.  So far in this issue, I have
covered the 1980's version of the beige box.  In the future I hope to add on
to that, maybe making a long range beige box...oh well..enuff of that.  On to
this issues teachings!!!

        In this issue, I will discuss PBXs.  What are PBXs any how?  Well the
standard name for these is:  Private Branch Exchange.  It is a switching
device that handles internal switching among phones within the organization;
PBX telephone systems are designed for larger organizations(more than 20 out-
side lines and over 60 telephones).  A PBX will serve a building or a series
of buildings much as a central office(CO) serves a community.  The PBX is the
switching center to which all telephones are connected.  The PBX must then
provide interconnection with all phones connected as well as with the local
central office for the purpose of accessing the long-distance network.

        PBXs may also provide many services that a central office provides at
additional costs.  PBXs can handle internal calling, conference calling, and
controlled access to long-distance lines and can keep accurate records of all
phone usage.  A growing number of businesses are viewing the PBX as a tool to
use in gaining control over rising telecommunications costs while providing
users with enhanced telephone features.

        So what, you ask.  Well, we can access these PBXs as well.  We can
use their long-distance calling features as well.  But, before we can even
access a PBX, we must know the numbers of some PBXs.  There will be some
listed at the end of this article.

        To recognize a PBX, you must realize how the system works.  Since it
is within a business, it will most likely use PIN numbers for allowing people
to use their services.  Each person/employee will get their own PIN number.
These PIN numbers are usually 4 digits long, yet I have actually seen a 5
digit one, believe me it was a shock.  As you may guess, you must brute force
it, it may help with a program (maybe I will write one for the next issue).
Good Luck!

        Yet, there is another way to recognize a PBX.  If you dial a number
and it goes directly to a dial-tone, then you most likely have a PBX.  Now to
gain access, you must figure out the outdial codes, conference codes, and so
on.  So, as you may realize, PBXs get to be exciting, especially when you
start accessing them.  This type of PBX is the most difficult to access.
Although some systems may have the same outdial codes, etc.  they are still
hard to find.  So, I suggest, go to a pay phone and fool around with there
system for a while.  Just to get a sense of what werks and what does not.  So,
it is up to you to work on getting in!

        Here are a couple of features performed regurarly by PBXs:

        Automatic Route Selection (ARS), is an example of a common feature.
With the growing number of long-distance telecommunications carriers, the
selection of a company to handle calls becomes more difficult. An ARS feature
will then connect the phone to the type of service or to the long-distance
company that can handle the call at the lowest price.  The PBX can perform
this route analysis and selection without the phone user even being aware of
the process.

        Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) is another feature designed for use
with PBX systems so that calls can be routed to the first open line to mini-
mize caller waiting time.  Another feature that is becoming available for PBXs
as well as other telephone systems is Automatic Number Identification (ANI).
With this feature, the party being called can identify the phone number of
the calling party.  The legality of this feature, related to privacy rights,
is being tested in many states.

        So as you can tell, PBXs have some interesting features, one of which
is ANI, which most of us despise.  But, we can use it to our advantage, as
well.  I bid you farewell, with my first Phreaking 101 article over.  I hope
this info on PBXs will be helpful.  I know it is useful info to anyone with a
good mind.  later...
