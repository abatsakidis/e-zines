Before I start off, let me say one thing:  I am not a hacker.  I am not a 
phreaker.  I'm just a person who's interested in spreading some of the info
out there around, and having a little fun and learning a lot while doing it.
I don't pretend to be "elite", I don't pretend to be the coolest thing since
sliced bread, and I don't pretend to be a genius; most of this stuff is just   
pranks and a few tricks for the fones to spare you some change.  Some of it
may be more serious, but I probably didn't think of it myself (if I did, you
can bet I'll tell you) I just want to help you learn and enjoy myself in the 
process.  This issue will focus mainly on phone pranks.

Three way calling is by far the most innovative thing the telco could
have done for phreaks.  For one, it can be used to force someone to 
accept collect calls (more on this later). It can also be used to make
someone's life hell.

Say you don't like some guy, let's say his name is Steve.  So you and a friend 
fire up the old three-way calling option, and call up Steve. Then, when he 
answers, just talk with your friend like nothing has happened.  He will shout, 
"HELLO????" for a while, until he thinks the phone company made a mistake, and 
he is listening in on someone's conversation.  Then start talking about him.  
Say things like, "By the way, did you hear what that idiot Steve said today?" 
and make plans to kill him, kidnap him, etc.  State exactly where and when 
you are going to do it (We'll take him down when he goes to his car for work!)
and then start talking about his girlfriend, and who she has been "cheating" 
with (be creative here...) If he is an absolute no-brainer, tell your friend 
your "voice mail number" and tell your friend to call it later, and leave 
a message.  This number can be anything; my favorites are some VERY dangerous 
950-sprint numbers, and non-800 computer dating services... In the 950 case, 
tell your friend your "PIN" number for your "voice mail box" and tell him to 
leave you a message.  This PIN number should be a code you know is being 
traced, then watch the white vans show up at Steve's house late one night.  
He won't get in trouble: after he explains it they will probably figure it out 
and try to trace you.  That's why it can also be fun to beige box this call 
from the second line in Steve's house, and get him in even more trouble... I 
can just see him sitting on the couch, all alone, being plagued by prank 
calls... suddenly, the phone rings again, and in a wierd Alfred Hitchcockesque 
scene, the operator says, "Sir! Those calls are coming from inside YOUR OWN 
HOUSE!"  If you're lucky, Steve will scream like a girl and run outside to 
escape the menace lurking in his formerly safe home.
One note for the beginners on Beige boxing:  Don't do it from the same place
too often:  They will find out about it and ruin any fun you were having in
the process.  For those of you who don't know how to make a beige box, here's
the easiest way you can do it-
Take a regular double-male phone cord (male plugs are the things you actually
plug in and take out, sortof like a real male plug) and cut one plug off. 
Cut away the Plastic casing on the wire and peel it away until you have about
3 inches of colored wires exposed; there should be four of them. 
(if there's only 2, that's ok too) Cut the black and yellow wires off 
completely and strip the red and green wires so you have about an inch of
copper showing.  The red wire is called the ring, and the green wire is the
tip.  This is important later.  Sodder the ring wire to one alligator clip and
electric tape it to make sure it stays put, and to cover up the rest of the
exposed wire.  Do the same with the green wire, and then you are finished!
To use:
Plug the remaining male jack into a phone that can stand alone from the base.
This means that you can take a regular double-male cord, and unplug the base 
from the phone and the wall jack.  Then plug the double male cord into the
remaining handset and the wall jack, and listen.  If you hear a dial tone, 
then the phone can stand alone.  Make sure this phone has a hangup button,
too.  Then, take the phone to a Bell Can or a TNI. (Bell cans are those green
boxes that are about 3 feet high, and a TNI is one of those gray little square 
boxes that hang on everybody's house and some businesses)  There are some bell
cans on phone poles, but those are not good to experiment for a first timer.
Get a file from your local bbs on cans and learn a little before you try this.
It's not hard, you just don't want to fuck up.  Wear a pair of gloves while 
doing this; you don't want to get shocked or leave prints.  Open the can or 
TNI with a 7/16 hex thingy or some needle nose-pliers. There should be a mass of 
wires all jumbled up but in some semblance of order.  Look for the terminals
that the wires are tied to: The red (ring) wires should be on the right side
of four terminals (Ring, red, right; the three "R's") and the Green (tip) 
terminal should be on the left.  Hook the red wire alligator clip on your
beige box to the ring terminal (or some of the wire that's exposed, if your
clips are for some reason too small) and the Green to the Tip terminal (or the
wire.. Blah blah blah) and listen to the phone.  You should have a dial tone!
If you're in a can, make sure it's not your own line (if you don't know how
to identify the lines, try calling your number to see if it's busy.) and have
phun! Untraceable calls to anywhere in the world (but you might want to be
careful: you don't want your prime location to be found out by the telco and
have them lock it or watch it.)  For those of you advanced people, I'm sorry
you had to listen to this, but it is necessary to educate. :) Also, what kind
of guy would I be if I didn't tell people how to beige box?  I wouldn't be
living up to my name...

If you don't have three-way calling, you can just make this circuit,called the
D-LOC box, and hook it up to two different phones and phone lines.  Set both 
switches to  "off" and dial your friend on one phone.  Then, dial your victim 
on the other.  Set the switches to "On" and you will have conferenced the two
lines together.  This does require two phones, and two phone lines, but this 
is essentially two beige boxes that can function separately and you can hook 
it up directly to a can.
Here's the circuit:

                             /\/\               /\/\

Plug in one phone to one Female Jack, and the other to the other female jack,
and attach the Red Wire alligator clip on one side to the ring (red) wire in
a can and the green wire alligator clip on one side to the green (tip) wire in
a can.  Do the same on another phone line in the can (any one: they don't have
to be in the same house or area) and phreak away. This works very well, but as
with any multiple connection, the voltage can get a little weak and people 
might start sounding faint.

That's not so hard, is it?  It's so obvious you might look it over... I wonder
how many other things are out there like that.


Annoying the operator with 3-way calling:

This is pretty simple... All you have to do is dial your friend first, and
then dial the operator.  When the operator answers, have your friend talk to
someone on an extension in his house (or if he has 3-way too, you can have
lots of fun) like a normal person (tough for some of us, but you'll do all 
right) and have him yell REALLY LOUD during this conversation.  It helps to
also introduce a little static into the conversation.  This can be simply done
by having one of your friends on the other line blow into the mouthpiece while 
the other is talking.  Then, do your best to try to explain to the operator 
(while your friend is shouting) that you don't know what happened, but your
phone just started going crazy.  Throw in all sorts of wierd stuff, like "I
was talking to my friend, and it shocked me!  When I woke up, it was all 
messed up!"

This can get very confusing, and I have had my friends in the backround saying
"So then I took a big baseball bat and beat his fucking head in!" while I'm 
trying to cope with this tremendous hardship of having another line patched 
into my own.  This is best done at night with the DLOC box (see above) from
Steve's house, and angrily request a lineman to come to your house right away!
NOTHING is creepier than having one of those wierd linemen come to your door
at 3 in the morning babbling something about line trouble.  Of course, by
then you are long gone, and of course you wore gloves while in the can (that
has other meanings, doesn't it?) so no one gets your fingerprints.  This is
also fun to do during one of Steve's lame parties for his "friends". 


Perhaps you want to know where Steve's house is?  Maybe he has an unlisted 
number, which you were able to find right after he changed it.  Wait until you
know he's having a party (phone monitoring will be covered in another issue)
and then call up pretending to be an attendee to his party, and you're lost.
(An attendee's name can also be obtained by monitoring his line, or you can 
check his mail to see who's getting an ivitation)  He'll gladly give you 
directions, so you can come to his ever-lovin-hamster party.  The rest is up
to you.  I can suggest some healthy pyrotechnics, or use your faithful TV 
Jammer (again, covered in a future issue) to liven up his party.


Using 3-way Calling to force a collect call:

This is the oldest trick in the book, and I'm not even going to pretend to
have invented it (My hat goes off to the PLA) but, regardless, it works.
Call a friend on one line, and make a collect call with the other.  When the 
operator comes on, say you'd like to bill the call to another number.  When
the operator calls the other party to ask if they would like to accept 
charges, Have your friend yell, "HELLO?" over the other person's hello.  
Then, your friend yells, "YES, I'LL ACCEPT THE CHARGES!"  The operator will 
hang up, and the person will be left there saying, "what?"  This only works on 
services that don't mute the calling party while verifying billing, which are 
far and few between.

Not a whole lot can be done with Call waiting, although I have heard you can
monitor someone's phone line with it.  Contact me if you know how.


Just plain annoying your enemies:

Call waiting isn't incredibly useful, but you can easily annoy anyone with it.  
Try calling up your enemy, then, as soon as they pick up, say, "Hi,
this is Steve Stevenson with Ameritech (or Bell Atlantic, whatever is local
to you) illegal numbers investigation, and it has come to my attention that 
your number has been used to illegally pl- oh, hold on... I have my manager on 
the other line."  Skip out to the other line, where your friend is waiting to 
have a chat with you.  It is surprising how long people will wait for you to 
come back.

If you have two lines (or if you have a D-LOC Box... that thing is useful) you 
can call up Steve as a telemarketer. (this one requires that he has call 
waiting.)  Then, call him up on the other line. Most people love to put 
telemarketers on hold, and Steve is no exception.  Let him click over to the 
other line, and then when Steve says, "hello?" say, "what?  Speak up."  Play 
this out for as long as you can,warping his words and shouting into the phone.  
When he finally clicks back (most people hang up in frustration) start trying 
to sell him some bullshit, but then call him up again on the other line.  
After he says hello, shout, "WHY DID YOU HANG UP ON ME?" Pull this one out 
again until he hangs up.  Then as soon as he comes back start yelling at him 
as the telemarketer, or perhaps hint at insults, such as,"Was that another one  
of your moron friends?" Start hurling insults at him and don't stop till 
he hangs up.  Call him up on the other line before he hangs up, as he is 
likely to ignore it this time untill the telemarketer hangs up.  Then when he 
picks up, yell at him some more and call him on the other line.  Keep this up, 
and he can never hang up without getting rung back immediately!  People start 
going crazy, because their phone just keeps calling back as soon as they hang 
up. This can go on for hours, and if you did this from a can with the D-LOC 
box you don't have to worry about being traced.  Of course, if Steve can't get 
off the line to report trouble, you still can't be traced! That is, until he 
can hang up, which is entirely up to you.  Perhaps you could build a device 
that autodials one line after another, and never stops! Then you could go to 
work, school, etc. without worry of your prey ever getting away!  Don't keep 
this up for too long however, because sooner or later Steve will wise up and 
use his friends phone or something to report the trouble, or just unplug the 
phone.  Still, this can be hours of fun on a boring night.

Everybody has a day or two in their life where all the BBSes are busy, you've
seen everything on TV, and all the books in your house are boring as hell.
That's why everyone needs to read a few things like this... So today we'll
learn to dial using rotary clicks, but there's a catch.  You can't dial using 
the buttons or the rotary dial, you have to learn to click the reciever button
really fast.  Here's a guide to what the numbers are:
1 click:  0
2 clicks: 1
3 clicks: 2
4 clicks: 3
5 clicks: 4
6 clicks: 5
7 clicks: 6
8 clicks: 7
9 clicks: 8
10 clicks:9
There is no pound sign and no star sign.  In some areas, 16 clicks somewhat
slowly (but not slowly enough to hang up) will give you test mode.  Also,
if you dial a wrong number, this can be a good chance to exercise your 
improvisational skills. >;) Also,  you can dial out from COCOTS using this: 
COCOTs are those really expensive phones that have no Ameritech, etc. logos,
and they are actually just a domestic phone line, with a real dial tone.
No COCOT gives you the real dial tone unless you insert money, but you
can get around this.  First, dial up an 800 number, then let them hang up.  
When you hear the dial tone, it's real!  Some COCOTs will detect this as the
other party hangs up, and hangs up itself, but you can hiss loudly into the 
receiver to disguise the noise and perhaps keep your dial tone.  Many COCOTs
will mute the keypad and the handset until you add money, unless its an 800
number.  In that case, it will let you dial and talk, but as soon as you are
connected, it mutes the keypad.  Then when it senses the other party hung up,
it mutes the handset.  This keeps you from using your trusty tone dialer (radio
shack, $30) but will not keep you from dialing out via rotary clicks!  If you
get good enough, you can make free calls anywhere (just don't abuse it, or the
owner is certain to notice the lack of money and shut it down or remove 800
numbers).
