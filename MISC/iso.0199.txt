                                                                                                                |
 Welcome to the The iSO News (>> www.orm.nu <<) first installment of our PC Game iSO Charts. With               |
 the new year, the ISO scene will most likely receive an influx of new people, new groups and more              |
 competition. With this in mind, now is the time to develop an organized way to rate the various groups         |
 that encompass the ISO scene. It will also help establish an acceptable set of rules. Rules that most of the   |
 major groups <DVNiSO, Cife, etc..> have been following anyway.                                                 |
 Here is our point system...                                                                                    |
                                                                                                                |
 Games : 5 Points + 1 if an exceptional/major title.                                                            |
                                                                                                                |
 On the C-64 scene groups were rated on a flat scale. Each game received a point, and whoever got the           |
 highest won. It was simple, unbiased and worked. The C-64 scene also didnt have trainers<at least              |
 released seperately>, update patches, and 20 billion hunting titles to factor into the point system. Still a   |
 flat rate works and prevents bias. One need only look at the rip scene's Just The Facts to see how a mag       |
 without a flat rate can be turned into a totally biased propaganda machine for the group that releases it.     |
 That will not happen here.                                                                                     |
                                                                                                                |
 Exceptional/Major Title : 1 Point.                                                                             |
                                                                                                                |
 While we think a flat rate point system is the best way to go, we also think that truly exceptional titles     |
 should get something extra. The logic behind this, is "Should the group that released Quake 2 get the          |
 same amount of points as the group that did Grizzley Hunter Deluxe?"  What qualifies as "Exceptional"?         |
 From last year games like Thief, Halflife, Myth 2, Quake 2, etc.. This year? Only Sim-City 3000 thus far,      |
 but future ones would be Alpha Centauri, Daikatana, etc... There should never be any dispute or                |
 controversy surrounding what is classified "Exceptional". It should always be universally accepted.            |
                                                                                                                |
 Trainers : 1 Point                                                                                             |
                                                                                                                |
 Trainers made specifically for ISO's will receive 1 point.                                                     |
                                                                                                                |
 Update Patches : 1 Point                                                                                       |
                                                                                                                |
 Games with protection, will often need the patch to be cracked before one can use it on there pirated copy.    |
 If this is so, the cracked patch will recieve a point. Patches that do not   require a crack, will receive     |
 nothing and will be ignored by this chart.                                                                     |
                                                                                                                |
 Kiddy Titles : 0 Points                                                                                        |
                                                                                                                |
 While we dont feel the need to penalize groups that release kiddy titles, we also will not support them in     |
 any way. Kiddy titles will be ignored. What constitutes a kiddy title? Edutainment, Teletubbies, Games         |
 made for the under-12 crowd. Use some common sense. We all know what kiddy titles are.                         |
                                                                                                                |
 Overburns :  5 or -5 points                                                                                    |
                                                                                                                |
 The reality of overburn's is that at least 40% of the intended audience cannot play them. Be it because they   |
 dont have CDR's capable of overburning, or the lack of 80 minute cd's in there area. The other reality is,     |
 since this is the ISO scene, games should at ALL times be complete. We feel the best way to handle this is     |
 to simply use some common sense. If you can rip out direct-x, game demos or anything on the cd that does       |
 not in ANY way affect the actual game, you should receive the same amount of points as any other game.         |
 Likewise, IF after ripping direct-x, game demos, etc, off the cd. The group finds that the only thing to do    |
 is either release it as an overburn or rip something that affects the game, the group should release it as an  |
 overburn and receive full points. The thing that should never be tolerated in the ISO scene is the ripping     |
 of game related elements. Thats what rips are for. 5 points will be deducted IF a group releases an            |
 overburn that can be done under 74 minutes by ripping direct-x or any of the non game related items            |
 listed above. 5 points will also be deducted if a group releases a game with anything game-related ripped      |
 just to fit it on a 74 minute CD. Notable examples from the past include the shortening of an audio track,     |
 the removable of an intro movie, the removal of an in-game .wav file, etc..                                    |
 This is probably the most controversial aspect of these charts, but we think this is simply the most fair and  |
 the most sensible way to handle overburns.                                                                     |
                                                                                                                |
 Dupes : -5 Points                                                                                              |
                                                                                                                |
 If someone release a dupe, they will have 5 points deducted from there total.                                  |
                                                                                                                |
 Repacks/Fixes/Fuckups                                                                                          |
 releases the first WORKING version of the game gets the points. If someone releases a game, only for it        |
 not to work.. Whoever releases the working repack, fix, etc.. Will receive full points for it. We wont         |
 penalize a group for making a mistake, but they will get 0 points for there fucked up release.                 |
                                                                                                                |
 Beta : -5 Points                                                                                               |
                                                                                                                |
 Beta's are lame. And 5 points will be deducted for releasing one. If we find out at a later date that          |
 someone released a beta, the points they received for the release will be removed, along with the              |
 additional 5 points for putting out a beta.                                                                    |
 Old Games : 0 Points                                                                                           |
                                                                                                                |
 Much like kiddy games, we dont feel the need to penalize those who release older games. Especially since       |
 many games released during the era of the rip scene were never done as an ISO. We also will not give any       |
 points for them. More often then not they are nukes, and should have no effect on this list.                   |
                                                                                                                |
 Addons : 5 Points                                                                                              |
                                                                                                                |
 Addons will receive the same amount of points as games. This includes Official or Unofficial addons.           |
                                                                                                                |
 Compilations : 0 Points                                                                                        |
                                                                                                                |
 A compilation is when a company takes a group of older games, slaps it into a spiffy package and chucks        |
 it out as a retail package. Some examples include Wizardry Gold, Prince of Persia Collection, Heroes of        |
 Might and Magic gold, etc... Theres nothing "new" added, just old games released as a collection. While        |
 some completist collectors may want these, most folks do not. Groups will not be penalized for releasing       |
 them, but they will not receive any points either.                                                             |
                                                                                                                |
 Races                                                                                                          |
                                                                                                                |
 What is a "Race"? A race is when 2 groups release a title around the same time, and then rush to see who       |
 can spread it around first. In this situation the "winner" is the group who can get it on the most sites first,|
 especially the rival group's they are racing against. Heres how we will deal with this situation... If there is|
 a winner, he will get full points for the release. If it comes down to an exact tie.. the points will be split.|
 Usually there is always a winner, and ties will be rare.. But they do happen.                                  |
                                                                                                                |

 In the year of 1998 DVNiSO emerged as the undisputed king of the ISO scene. They had more total                |
 releases then any of there rivals. For January though, they are only able to secure the #2 spot. With that     |
 said, they still had the top 3 releases of the month in Simcity 3000<which we consider good enough to          |
 warrant an exceptional rating> Close Combat 3, and Worms Armageddon.                                           |

 If someone had to pick a #2 for 1998, it was CiFE. This month they manage to upset DVNiSO and claim            |
 the #1 spot. Although only one game broke $20, they still deserve credit for claiming #1. A great month        |
 for CiFE.                                                                                                      |

 Quartex is a new ISO games group for 1999, and released the very first title of the new year. It was a very    |
 good debut release, and a nice game. They also released UFO's, which is easily over 6 months old, and          |
 thus a nuke. Since its not a dupe, points will not be removed, but it is old so it will be given 0 points. In  |
 the future, look for Quartex to compete on some of the European titles.                                        |

 even scoring Fallout 2 in 1998. They only had 1 title for January.                                             |

 Fairlight has seen better days.... First they start off the month with a valid title. Then they ruin it by     |
 releasing a very blatant and obvious dupe. The man listed as the supplier in that NFO<youngblood> came         |
 onto IRC and stated that it was a mistake, and acknowledged Fairlights error. Every group makes                |
 mistakes, so not a big deal. They follow it up with a decent addon and a soccer manager. Then release          |
 another blatant dupe.                                                                                          |

 This was there debut release, and a blatant dupe of game released by DVNiSO in October of 1998. A very         |
 lame debut, and i cant imagine them releasing anything in the future, even budget stuff. Most likely this      |
 will be there first and last title, and they will fade into obscurity.                                         |

 PDMiSO did 1 title this month, and it was a good one. PDM's performance in the ISO side was mixed in           |
 1998. They did a decent amount of top quality titles, but marred there name by also doing some beta's and      |
 even a dupe. They are off to a good start thus far in 1999, and if they keep to there current path, they       |
 could even challenge for the top spot later in the year. The potential is definately there.                    |

 NWW Is obviously a fake lable. A simple look at the nfo<quite funny to read> confirms that. Eat This is        |
 an overburn, which is probably why it went under the NWW lable. Many groups have been very vocal               |
 about overburns being "lame" etc... But regardless, the game is quite playable and good. The game also         |
 cannot be ripped to fit under 74 minutes without removing any items that affect the game. Thus in              |
 accordance with our rules, it gets full points.                                                                |

 Isoz is a small and pretty much unknown group. They did manage to release a valid title this month             |
 though, and thus receive points for it. We dont know much about them, so we really dont know exactly           |
 what to expect from them in the future.                                                                        |

 Overview.                                                                                                      |

 Overall it was a very slow month, which is normal for January. Still there were 2 major titles released,       |
 Simcity 3000 and Close Combat 3. Both done by DVNiSO. There was also major controversy surrounding             |
 both. With the huge propaganda fight between  DVNiSO and Fairlight, some people still have no idea             |
 what to believe. With that in mind we will address them here. Close Combat 3 was resolved very quickly.        |
 It ended with a member of Fairlight<Youngblood> coming into the #dvniso channel and admitted that              |
 there release was a mistake and that they never should have released it. His full and exact quotes were        |
 pasted on our site<www.orm.nu> as one of our staff was there to view them as it happened. We still             |
 compared both titles side by side to see what the deal was, and found them to be byte by byte the exact        |
 same game. The only difference was the inclusion of a scanned in manual on the FLT release. So the             |
 question was "Is the inclusion of a small scanned in manual, justification for re-releasing a whole CD and     |
 labeling it a 'Final'?" We dont think so, and neither did anyone else, including Fairlight. So there version   |
 was nuked and labled a dupe. Sim City 3000 was a different story. The SC3K scandal started on the rip          |
 scene, and then somehow ended up polluting the ISO scene. It became a large propaganda war between             |
 the DVNiSO/Origin team and the Fairlight/Class squad. Rather then reprint all the propaganda here, we          |
 will just report our own findings and conclusion. If anyone truly cares, you can read both sides NFO's,        |
 statements, and comments on www.orm.nu. The whole fight boils down to one significant fact - If you hit        |
 cntrl-alt-v in the DVNiSO release the version information says Beta. For the record both versions say          |
 "Prerelease beta" in the code. With that said, its also not uncommon for store finals to say "Beta" in the     |
 code or version. Heart of Darkness was an example we used on our page of this occurence. So what we did        |
 was a bin compare. We also compared file sizes,  file dates, actual gameplay and we even had 2 seperate        |
 crackers/coders actually look inside them. Our conclusion is this - Both releases are exactly the same.        |
 Aside from that one string listed above, the games are 100% identical. Even FLT members were not able          |
 to name us a difference between the two<and we did ask>. With that said, its obvious that DVNiSO did           |
 release the Final version of SC3k. Fairlight also did the same, just a week after Dvn. That makes the FLT      |
 version a dupe, and thus it gets -5 points in our charts. The single worst aspect of the whole Sc3k            |
 controversy is the lengths that Fairlight went to mislead the public. While we attempt to remain impartial     |
 and non-biased, its very hard to not call Fairlights actions lame. Aside from the Flt/Dvniso fight, there      |
 were a couple of other notable releases this month.. Including "Worms Armageddon" which featured the           |
 new years first "race". While it was definately close, DVNiSO managed to beat Cife on the release, and         |
 get the points for it. Still, in the end it didnt matter, as Cife re-emerged as a major force in the ISO scene,|
 claiming the #1 spot and defeating DVNiSO. An amazing accomplishment considering the stranglehold              |
 that the Deviance team had on the iso scene during all of 1998. Congratulations Cife! Some of the other        |
 notable releases that are worth downloading include The Rainbow Six Addon - Eagle Watch released by            |
 Fairlight, Liath released by Quartex, Tunguska by PDMiSO, Tellurian Defense from DVNiSO, and finally           |
