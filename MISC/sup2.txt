What the fuck is this?

This is issue 2.5 of Phone Punx Magazine. Because we have a weird
delusion that PPM will become one of the minor pillars of the
underground (like the Havoc Technical Journal from WAY back), we wanted
to refrain from publishing time sensitive stuff like numbers, or limited
time offers. Because this stuff should be spread around despite the fact
that it will eventually die, this supplemental is being passed around.
It also allows us to put in things that would be considered rather
trivial otherwise (like website and equipment reviews, things we think
are funny, etc). These supplementals are more causual, with any luck a
little easier to read, and might bring in a little more traffic.


Whats going on at PPN headquarters?

Its back to school time for many of us with the PPN, so Seuss' witty
commentary on alt.phreaking will become more sparse, Mohawk will somehow
become less accessible, and Black Axe will change nothing but the
pre-set frequencies in his collection of scanners. We're all mourning
the end of Root Zine, which has served us so well in the last several
years... but Mutter will have nothing to do with people asking to take
over the magazine. Lets hope Mohawk has a little more sense than that.
Seuss is being cited in M.L. Shannon's next (and final) reprint of The
Bug Book, and has received several threats of lawsuits. Iron Feather
Journal (!!) has mailed us asking for reprint rights for some of our
material, but we haven't heard back from them since. Our ranks swell
with several members of the soon to be disbanded Dissdent magazine; our
vulture-like hovering over them is sickening, but damned if we won't get
more cool writers.


Site review: Blue Fuzzy Telephonics

Blue Fuzzy Telephonics (http://internettrash.com/users/bft/) is one of
the best sites on telephony i've ever seen.The webmaster, TestSet
Johnny, has assembled a collection of excellent files, is very friendly,
and most importantly of all has been wardialing for longer than most
modern phone phreaks have been alive. The Blue Fuzzy Numbers file is
stuffed with weird, cool, and sometimes very useful numbers. In light of
how complete the numbers file is, i'm forced to wonder if this man is
employed. This site deserves an award for its completeness, coolness
factor, and the fact that the webmaster is  nice guy.


Free Stuff: I hope to god that I can have a collum like this in every
supplemental. Anyone wanna tip me off with cool freebies?

- Lucent will cheerfully send you a technician to consult you on your
business' phone system if you contact them before Sept 30. Please be
nice to the poor drone they send you... its probably underpaid anyway.
See: http://www.lucent.com/smallbusiness/consult1.html for details

- Spiffy butt set posters can be had from Dracon Harris. Call them and
ask for information on a specific set, and they'll send you a shiny
(read as content-free-show-it-to-the-boss) catalog with a fold-out
poster in the back describing all their sets.

- HotPOP is actually offering web based email addresses at
"phreaker.net". We're not sure what to make of it, or the people using
the service either. Well, it beats hotmail accounts at least.


Random: Just to make you laugh, and maybe think a little, heres the

Dear "webmaster", i'm mailing you this form in order to inform you that
your site:

[  ] Needs some work.
[  ] Sucks.
[  ] REALLY sucks!
[  ] MAN, WHERE IN THE FUCK DO YOU GET OFF HAVING INTERNET ACCESS!!??

My opinion on the quality of your site is based primarily on the fact
that it contains:

[  ] A copy of the same damn list of telco accronyms that EVERYONE has
seen.
[  ] A copy of the "Jolly Rodger Cookbook" available for
viewing/download.
[  ] Gratuitous use of 31337 Sp3||iNg.
[  ] Has listed only one issue of your lame zine for more than 6 months.
[  ] A listing of all the exchanges in your NPA, glaringly copied fron
NANPA.
[  ] A copy of your enemies list with their home phone numbers and
instructions to harass them.
[  ] A disclaimer longer than anything else *you* wrote.
[  ] More than a page of conference reviews.
[  ] A links page with more than half of the targets dead.
[  ] Box plans that couldn't work without altering the laws of time,
space and modern physics.
[  ] A serious reference to Blotto Boxes.
[  ] Material cut out of the #hack FAQ and redone to make it look like
you wrote it.
[  ] Material you wrote that demonstrates your total lack of
understanding of telephony.
[  ] A solicitation to join your "group"
[  ] A notice saying no matter how much we would want to participate in
your group, membership is closed.
[  ] Instructions on manufacturing explosives.
[  ] Guides to revenge.

In addtion, your site also displays:

[  ] Myriad useless logos/frames that create a 2+ minute load time even
on a 56k connection.
[  ] A graphic of a pot leaf for no obvious reason.
[  ] A spinning skull .gif.
[  ] The "dripping blood" .gif as a divider.
[  ] Porno banners.
[  ] A big, ugly link exchange banner that are doing you no good anyway.
[  ] Pop-up java windows with a warning about how you're not legally
responsible for anything we do with the info on your site.
[  ] A 'quote' by Janet Reno saying "They have phones and my have other
weapons of mass destruction." A quote means to repeat what someone says.
She did NOT say that.


Which I happen to find annoying, as it slows down the load time on your
page, which may well have sucked anyway (see opening comments).

So in conclusion:

[  ] A little more attention to maintenance/detail and your site will be
pretty cool.
[  ] The addition of some practical info, and the excising of the
bulshit and you'll have an ok site.
[  ] I've decided you don't deserve a webpage, i'm sending an angry
letter to your ISP demanding an rm -rf of your directory.
[  ] For the good of the community, i'm going to have you blacklisted at
InterNic.
[  ] Please don't breed.
[  ] Don't ever start up Photoshop again.
[  ] Come back to us when you've hit puberty.
[  ] A sense of humor will help you out ENORMOUSLY in life.
[  ] Crawl back to IRC where people like you belong.
[  ] Stop renting the movie "Hackers", it distorts your sense of
reality.
[  ] HEY!! I heard skateboarding was the new cool thing!! Why don't you
go and do that instead of trying to make yourself look cool in THIS
venue!!
[  ] Be thankful you got this gentle warning instead of the
earth-shattering ICMP attack and the boot up your ass that you
ever-so-richly deserve.

This form was based on a post to alt.phreaking I saw many moons ago.
Appologies to the creative soul who authored it.


That about does it for this issue of the supplemental. PLEASE PLEASE
PLEASE remember that Phone Punx Magazine is more professional,
informative, and infinitely cooler than these files.
