.ili. Ask the TV .ili. 
---------------------- by Morbus

What a joke we are. What a joke we have become. The Joker once said if
he had a past that he would want it to be multiple choice. Too bad we
can't use that to be our past and our future.

Look around us, at the books we read, the TV we watch, and the radio we
listen to. Such a world of "push"; nothing is ever "pull" anymore.
Nowadays, we can't even listen to a baseball game on the radio without
the announcers reading some canned advertisements for some bank or for
some insurance company. We mindlessly sit in our chairs and do what we
have done for practically our whole miserable existence... be drawn in
and then quartered by the media giants; quartered into sections of what
they believe in and what they want us to buy. Such a pity.

We seem inexorably drawn into what the television and the media have
made us to be. Look at the alien craze. Companies like Schwa (whose name
I'm sure I've misspelled, but I just can't wait until some alien
hippie who has the Rasta Schwa on his Rabbit VW emails me the correct
spelling) have become so popular that they	have merely degraded what
the culture once was. With shows like the X-Files, Sightings, Weird
Universe and a million other variants (as widespread as the Cops
ripoffs), we have become infatuated with "those who are out there" and
"trusting no one". Isn't that a good message to throw to our kids.
"Trust no one, Junior, you'll only get Tippered in the end."

With aliens, goatsuckers, and the paranormal in general becoming more
and more mainstream, we can only expect to see the occult sciences
becoming more mainstream. With shows like Millennium, the X-Files (yet
again), American Gothic, and movies like The Relic, how many more
Satanists who sacrifice virgins to the Devil (the most 'movie portrayed'
yet wildly inaccurate vision) will come out of the woodwork wearing
their goth clothing and their paganistic symbols?

What am I trying to say? Ask the TV, for it holds all the answers.
