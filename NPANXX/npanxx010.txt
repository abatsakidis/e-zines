I never thought the time would come when I would have to sit here and type
something out like this. This zine has been going strong for nearly two
years now, without much going wrong at all. Sure, we've had a revolving
door of members, which leave, come back, and leave again, but despite that
we've always had enough articles to publish a well put together zine.

Apparently times change. While all the members of Team Phreak knew that things
would eventually slow down with some of us entering college, and just getting
on with our lives, we never thought that the influx of articles from the
outside would just totally stop, and that's exactly what has happened.

npanxx cannot be published without outside sources of information. It's simply
impossible for the 3 current members of team phreak to publish enough info for
the zine to be current and important. This is the entire reason that we rely
on the outside.

It took forever to get npanxx010 together. Barely anyone submitted anything,
and even our own members are running out of ideas, and time. This is why we
must now beg for you to write articles for the zine. Whatever you know, just
submit them. Of course we're not going to lower our standards, but you don't
know, our standards might be pretty low already, so just submit that really
bad article that you always wanted to write.

I don't want npanxx010 to be our last issue, but without any outside help, we
might have to go on a hiatus for more months than we usually do between issues,
and this doesn't help us at all.

Thanks for visiting the site, and for those of you who submit articles, thank
you.

CDMA is the latest and most advanced cellular technology around. It is able 
to carry more conversations than any other network. In my opinion, it is 
also most secure.

Sprint and Verizon us CDMA (code division multiple access). Verizon used to 
be analog, so when they upgraded to CDMA they just overlaid it on their 
analog frequencies. 824mhz-849mhz. This is the reason their CDMA phone have 
a a/b carrier selection. Back in the analog days the FCC required that there 
be two cellular carriers per area, so they divided the spectrum into two. A 
would be one carrier, and b would be the second Sprint uses the 1900mhz 
band. This simplifies things. There is no a/b carrier because the entire 
band is digital. Carrier separation can be done by digital coding.

  A base station (tower) is links all the cellular traffic to a MSC (mobile 
switching center). This is a central office for use with cellular networks. 
Inside that there are several computers. One is the home location register. 
The HLR keeps a log of what base station each phone number is using, so 
incoming calls can be routed. Next to that is the Visitor location register. 
The VLR does the same job as the HLR, except for the roamers using their 
network. When someone roams, their carrier's HLR transfers all the 
customer's billing information to the VLR for billing and authentication 
porpoises. There is the authentication center. The AuC stores all the ESNs 
(electronic serial numbers) and a-keys (encryption keys). It also performs 
calculations for authentication as described later in this file. Each MSC is 
linked together like a network so calls can be routed around. Inside that 
network, there are a few gateway mobile switching centers (GMSC). They are 
use for routing calls between the cellular network and the outside PSTN. 
(public service telephone network).

  The amount of hertz represents the amount of times a carrier wave goes up 
and down. The higher the frequency, the closer together the peaks of the 
wave are, since all radio signals travel at the speed of light. 1900mhz has 
a six inch gap (wavelength) between peaks. 800mhz has a 15 inch wavelength. 
The antenna of the phone should be ideally half the wavelength. Higher 
frequencies are absorbed easier. 1900mhz has a shorter range than 800mhz. 
The advantage of this is that cell sites can be smaller, so the frequency 
can be reused on a nearby cell site without  interference. This allows more 
phones to use the network at a time. Analog has such a large coverage area 
because of its low frequency. Verizon's CDMA network has similar. This is 
also why GSM coverage in the US isn't too good either, because it sprint 
shares the 1900mhz band with cingular's towers. Scanners capable of 
listening in on the 1900mhz or 800mhz band are illegal. A eavesdropper would 
have to heavily modify a scanner to do this.

  The information transmitter has to be represented in a way. Since we are 
using digital technology, there are only two pieces of information that need 
to be sent, 1 and 0.  Early digital networks used FM (frequency modulation). 
In this the amplitude (the height of the wave) would remain constant. The 
frequency changed slightly. For example, the tower would be listening in on 
824.5mhz. To represent a 0, the phone would transmit at 824.5001, and for a 
1 it would transmit at 824.5002. The phone changes frequency, but the tower 
still receives everything transmitted within the 824.5mhz range. Since there 
can be an infinite amount of decimal points, this technology works for 
analog also, such as analog cell phones or radio stations. AM (amplitude 
modulation) uses the amplitude of the wave to represent the information sent 
in the same way. The frequency stays constant. The amplitude of a wave can 
be easily interfered with by things such as weather. FM is clearer. Modern 
digital cellular technology uses a technology called phase modulation. With 
phase modulation, the frequency and amplitude of the signal stay constant. 
Phase modulation changes a radio wave's normal pattern. It shifts or alters 
a wave's natural fall to rest or 0 degrees. By forcing changes in a sine 
wave you can convey information. You don't stop or abbreviate the sine wave, 
you change its shape or angle of attack. As an example, 90 degrees, 0 
degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees might be representing binary digits 
00,01,10, and 11 respectively. Phase modulation allows for more frequencies 
in a spectrum, since there doesn't need to be a frequency change to 
represent information. This also allows more bandwidth, because you can 
transmit several 1s and 0s per wave cycle completion, instead of just one 
bite. This is also slightly more secure, because a eavesdropper would have 
to write a program that could interpret the phase modulated waves and binary 
information.

  Code Division Multiple Access is spread spectrum, aka frequency hopping. 
The phone and the tower and constantly hopping from one frequency to 
another, extremely fast. When a call is initiated, the tower and phone have 
knowledge of the pattern of frequencies for them to communicate on. This is 
a 42 bit PN code. It is calculated from the SSD_1 key and the CAVE 
encryption algorithm. Since the SSD_1 is never sent over the air, the 
pattern cannot be determined over the air. All this is explained in the 
paragraph below. CDMA technology provides extra security, and also allows 
for more phones to be used per cell site. It would be extremely difficult 
and complicated for an eavesdropper to build a scanner device to listen in 
the 800mhz or 1900mhz band and be able to hop frequencies within that range, 
much less have the knowledge of the pattern.


  CDMA uses a technology called Authentication. Each CDMA phone has a 
network set 64-bit (8 digit) number inside of it called an A-key. The a-key 
is randomly set by the dealer's computers. After the key is programmed into 
the phone, the dealer uses a encrypted dialup to program the ESN and a-key 
into the network's authentication center. There is no further record of the 
a-key, and it is not visible to any human during this process. The a-key can 
be changed by the network over the air in some cases. When this is done, it 
uses a 512-bit Diffie-Helleman key agreement algorithm, a strong algorithm 
well suited for job. The AcU (authentication center) has knowledge of the 
phone's ESN (electronic serial number) and the phone's A-key.  The AcU is a 
computer inside the MSC. The Tower sends the phone and AcU a random number, 
referred to as a RAND challenge. The phone then uses this number, the 
phone's A-key and the ESN each as variables in complex calculations. So does 
the AcU. These calculations are part of the CAVE(cellular authentication and 
voice encryption) encryption algorithm. The result is referred to the SSD_1 
(secret shared data, always 64-bits), or the AUTHSIGNATURE. The 
AUTHSIGNATURE is then sent to the tower and compared with the AUTHSIGNATURE 
the AcU came up with. If the it matches, the phone is authenticated and 
allowed to make the call. The tower also uses the SSD_1 to calculate a 
pattern of frequencies for the phone and tower to communicate on. Then the 
AcU and the phone run the same variables through the other part of the CAVE 
to create the SSD_2. This number is then used as a variable in voice 
encryption. The CAVE has no known flaws. There is no way to break the 
encryption. The A-key and ESN cannot be determined over the air, no matter 
how much information is intercepted or obtained over the air. The CAVE 
algorithm has also been published and open to public scrutiny. No flaws have 
been found.  The A-key is kept very secure. The only place it is stored is 
in the AuC, and in the handset itself. Unlike the ESN, the a-key isn't 
written on the phone, nor viewable through the handset in any way. To 
determine the a-key, you must extract the memory chips from the victim's 
phone, then use a EPROM reader/writer to do a core dump onto a computer. It 
is more logical for a clone to get it from the AcU. Very few people have 
access to the AuC, so social engineering would also be extremely hard.

     On top of the CAVE encryption, there are several other encryption 
algorithms used for communicating information over the air. These algorithms 
use the SSD_2 as a variable in their calculations. One is the E-CMEA 
(Enhanced- Cellular message encryption algorithm) used for encrypting DTMF 
tones. The DTMF tones must be secure because many people use them to enter 
credit card numbers while ordering this over the phone. The ORYX algorithm 
is used on top of CAVE for encrypting control information, such as tower 
handoffs. ( A handoff occurs when you are leaving the range of one cellular 
tower and entering another one. The network need to have your phone switch 
towers without loosing the call).

   On top of encryption and a-key authentication, CDMA uses two other 
security measures. The tower can request past call logs from the phone's 
stored records and match the phone numbers and times up to the ones in the 
tower's call logs. If they don't match, the phone is not authenticated. Also 
the network is smart enough to notice if  two identical phones are active at 
the same time, drop the calls and not authenticate either of them until the 
problem is resolved.


     RF (radio frequency) fingerprinting is a technology that was used to 
combat fraud back in the analog days. The tower and AcU would use the RF 
signature and radio properties of the transmitter on the cell phone to 
determine if it matched the one used on the legit subscriber's phone. There 
were a few ways around this. One is to use a transmitter identical to the 
one on the victim's phone. Another would be to warp the crystal to change 
the rf signature. Another would be to make the signal strength so low that 
the tower couldn't get a good fingerprint, and would hopefully let the call 
go through anyway. If it uncertain if CDMA networks use this technology, 
however it is most likely that they do not. If they do, this would just be 
another step that would make CDMA cloning less worth the time.


  Next article I Will discuss potential strategies to eavesdrop and clone a 
cdma network, among any other potential security weaknesses I can think of 
during that time.

2. Verizon's Expanded Announcement System                             |

To skip directly to listening to the supplemental audio file first, which 
will let you hear the menu prompts from inside the Expanded Announcement 
System, go to:

http://goblin.crappyhosting.com/Expanded_Announcement.mp3

Telco error messages... We've all heard one at some point. An atypical error 
message usually starts off with those 3 tones, known as S.I.T. (Special 
Information Tones) followed by, "We're sorry. The number you have reached... 
etc". But, have you ever wondered about the recording process for phone 
company error messages, or how they're stored, accessed, modified, or 
deleted when need be? Well, if you happen to live in my part of Verizon's 
service area, Verizon maintains a phone system they call their Expanded 
Announcement System. Now, due to the fairly potent nature of this system, I 
won't be disclosing certain important specifics here, such as the phone 
number to dial, or the passcode to enter in. But, I will tell you that once 
inside the system, you can listen to, record, modify, or delete error 
messages. 

The thing I was kind of surprised to learn about is that a single 
telco error message is usually 2 or more individual recordings pieced 
together to form a single error message. And actually, the system refers to 
those individual recordings as a "message". And, an entire error message put 
together from those individual message recordings is called an 
"announcement". Each individual message in an announcement is stored in a 
slot, which the system refers to as a "position". And, every other position 
in an announcement seems to be blank. (Doesn't contain a message). I think 
this is because it contains a "message function" instead. Which, I believe 
tells the system whether to play another message for the next position in 
the announcement. And, if so, it would also tell it which one to play. 
Otherwise, the announcement is deemed finished, and therefore ends if no 
message function is contained in the next position. In other words, a 
message function serves as the parameters within an announcement. And, as 
you probably guessed, there exists a feature in the menus to "define a 
message function". And, although I didn't mess with that feature to play it 
safe, I imagine it could be a fairly involved process. 

By the way, if you were to record over an existing message with one of your
own, all announcements that used that particular message within it would now
feature your re-recording of that message. However, the system seems to not 
allow for any recorded messages assigned for use in many announcements to be 
recorded over. Apparently, this is some sort of failsafe measure. However, 
you can always re-record a message that's hardly assigned much for use 
within announcements, or Isn't assigned for use in any announcement. Also, 
you can record a brand new message within any blank "message number" that 
doesn't already contain a recorded message. Or, just use option 5 from 
within the message administration menu (accessible from the main menu) to 
create a new message/message number from scratch. The system information 
feature in the main menu lets you listen to a list of open announcement 
numbers, message functions, and open or unused message numbers. Unused 
message numbers are recorded,  but unassigned messages. 

Different announcements and message functions are stored seperately in 
individual announcement numbers, and message function numbers on the system.
Just like how the different messages are stored seperately in individual 
message numbers. All in all, Verizon's Expanded Announcement System is pretty 
complex and vast, with a storage of thousands of messages, and lots of 
announcements and message functions. And, an almost limitless number of ways 
to combine them all. As a result, I would guess it could take a pretty good 
amount of time to put together an entire announcement. Especially if It's 
all done from scratch, rather than through modifying or using any existing 
messages, message functions, or announcements. But, I don't think I 
recommend spending long sessions logged into the Expanded Announcement 
System in the first place. Especially not during regular Verizon business 
hours. (It's just good common sense). Also, I don't know whether this system 
is logging ANI, either. Besides, It's pretty obvious that they intended this 
system to be for telco tech personnel use only, anyway. By the way, you 
don't have to live in my local or regional area to access the Expanded 
Announcement System, since It's dialable through a standard 10 digit phone 
number.

Introduction
Part I: Definition of E911
Part II: E911 for PBX/ALI users
Part III: Master Street Address Guide (MSAG)
Part IV: Glossary of Terms


Introduction
------------


Recently, 911 centers all across the United States have been changing from their classic,
simple call-in 911 centers, to more complicated, and versitile E911 centers. These centers
offer advantages to the police/medical/fire departments far beyond what used to be possible.


In this article is typed out different portions of documents by BellSouth which deal with their
E911 system. This document deals with various areas of the E911 system from it's uses with PBX/ALI
users, to numerical codes used in the File Transfer System (FTS).



Part I: Defintion of E911
-------------------------

"911" has been designated in the United States as the number to be used by the public to summon
emergency aid or to report a crime, fire, or accident. It's main purpose is to make it easier for
people in time of emotional stress to contact the proper emergency agency. An important advantage
of 911 emergency service is improved (reduced) response time.

The original 911 service, known as Basic 911 (B911), routes a call to one centralized answering
location. The attendant at the answering location obtains the pertinent information that identifies
the call and the caller's need. The attendant then determines the appropriate agency and dials a
seven didget number to transfer the caller to that gency. The calling party's emergency information
is verbally relayed to the responding agency and a unit is dispatched to the caller's location.

Enhanced 911 service, or E911, is a full featured electronic system that provides three (3) major
enhancements to basic 911 service:

SELECTIVE ROUTING - Electronically routes 911 emergency calls to the proper Public Safety Answering
Point (PSAP) based on the Emergency Services Number (ESN) code that has been assigned to the caller's
address.

AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION (ANI) - Provides the calling party's seven digit telephone number
on a display at the PSAP.

AUTOMATIC LOCATION IDENTIFICATION (ALI) - Provides the name and address associated with the calling
party's telephone number on the display at the PSAP.

NOTE: To receive the maximum benefit of E911, the area served must be assigned valid house numbers.
Without a house number, dispatching is delayed and the responding agency has difficulty finding the
correct address.


Part II: E911 for PBX/ALI users
-------------------------------


The E911 Private Branch Exchange/Automatic Location Identification (PBX/ALI) Service provides
a PBX customer, located in an E911 serving area, with the ability to offer full E911 service
to it's station users. Ordinarily, the location identification information displayed on a
Public Service Answering Point (PSAP) attendant screen for a caller from a PBX not equipped
with this service will be a billing or service number and address of the PBX. This information
may not indicate the actual physical location from which the call is placed. With the PBX/ALI
service the "off premise" location identification information is available to the PSAP when a
caller, using a connecting station of the PBX, dials 911.


The PBX/ALI service provides the PBX customer with private E911 trunks from their PBX. (i.e.,
private switch) to the E911 Tandem. To utilize this service, the PBX must be capable of sending
the calling station's telephone number to the BellSouth E911 network in a specified Multifreq.
(MF) Address Signaling "protocol". This "addressing protocol" information is known as Automatic
Number Identification (ANI), and when received, is routed by the BellSouth E911 Tandem to the
appropriate PSAP. At the PSAP the data specific to the calling station is accessed from ALI
databases maintained by BellSouth.


This critical data associated with the calling location, including the telephone number, name,
address, and the nearest responding emergency agencies, greatly enhances the speed and
efficiency of the PSAP dispatch operation.


Updates to this station data are supplied to BellSouth by the customer as required by moves and
changes in a dial-up access basis. The manner and frequency in which these updates are accomplished
is negotiated between the customer and BellSouth.


Part III: Master Street Address Guide (MSAG)
--------------------------------------------


The Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) is the portion of the 911 database which contains address and
Emergency Service Number (ESN) information. The MSAG associates customer accounts with the
appropriate ESN based on the customer's address. ESNs designate the routing of each E911 call to the
proper PSAP.

Once the mapping and ESN assignment is complete, the ICO will use the map to associate an ESN with
each street in their territory. The ESN assignment along with other specific street address data will
be used to create the MSAG. The ICO should provide the MSAG data by the date agreed upon with BST.

It is the responsibility of each Telephone Company participating in the E911 system implementation to
provide specific street address data to INTRADO based on their customer account records. This data
must include all streets in a wire center. The MSAG is loaded directly into the E911 database
via magnetic tape or sent via electronic transfer as agreed upon with INTRADO.

A printed copy of the MSAG will be provided to the ICO once the data is loaded into the E911 database.
The ICO should obtain approval of the MSAG data from the city/county/parish. An MSAG ledger should
be used to make updates to the MSAG once it is loaded into the E911 database.

That's the jist of it. It's a nice upgrade from what a lot of places used to use, and some still do,
but normal E911 isn't what a lot of people think it is. Hope this shed some light on the subject.


Part IV: Glossary of Terms (In order of appearance)
---------------------------------------------------

SELECTIVE ROUTING - Electronically routes 911 emergency calls to the proper Public Safety Answering
Point (PSAP) based on the Emergency Services Number (ESN) code that has been assigned to the caller's
address.


AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION (ANI) - Provides the calling party's seven digit telephone number
on a display at the PSAP.


AUTOMATIC LOCATION IDENTIFICATION (ALI) - Provides the name and address associated with the calling
party's telephone number on the display at the PSAP.


PBX/ALI SERVICE - The PBX/ALI service provides the PBX customer with private E911 trunks from their PBX. (i.e.,
private switch) to the E911 Tandem.


MASTER STREET ADDRESS GUIDE - The Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) is the portion of the 911 database
which contains address and Emergency Service Number (ESN) information. The MSAG associates customer 
accounts with the appropriate ESN based on the customer's address. ESNs designate the routing of each 
E911 call to the proper PSAP.


Well, that's all of the important stuff that I can think of. I'm sure that there's a ton of things that
I forgot, but that's it for now.

4. An interview with John Draper                                      |

NOTE from bor: When pare conducted this interview, it was meant to be a serious
interview about John Draper, and his views on different subjects such as spam.
However, through the interview it became more about his business than anything
else and became a pretty bad interview. However, because of who the interview
is with, we will publish it anyways because there is most likely some interest.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pare: What exactly is spamcrunchers, and how will it work?


John: Spamcrunchers works on both the client level and server level. It consists
of a server, acting as a pop3proxy. Or a person can get their mail through our
very secure web based server. On the client side are filters, customized to the
user. Each person's ham and spam are different. Spamcrunchers will first be
introducted as an "online" system


pare: Will there be any beta testers for spam cunchers?


John: I will be soliciting for beta testers first. I would want about 2-3 beta
testers.


John: So the user will log into the online service, and setup their POP proxy stuff.
By making one or more proxy connections to their normal proxy servers. They would read
their mail normally, using Eudora or Outlook. As they read their mail, ham is seperated
from spam by adding a special header to the mail. Then the local Outlook or Eudora would
make the final filtering, but there is also pre-filtering at the server level. So,
when you get a spam email, you click just ONE button, and the IP of the mail gateway is
then blocked, and you won't get anymore spam. Spam email is also encoded differently than
regular email. This is also picked up. Once you collect your spam, then you can do a lot
of cool things. You can analyze it. The program goes through the body of the spam message
and interperts the code.


John: If user interprets this encoding as "unauthorized" all further spam with this
encoding is blocked before it even sees the Baysian filtering. It also extracts the
embedded URL's and email addresses. Then it validates the opt out link or mailbox and
determines if the opt out is real. If it is not real, then you move that message to the
"Report FTC" mailbox for later reporting. Same for spamcop, Spews, and other anti-spam
groups as well as the DCC list.


John: It then digs even deeper. It analyzes the headers, and determines which ones are
bogus. It then does a whois lookup on the website promoted in the spammers message.


pare: What kind of information would be shown about the spammer?


John: Determines if the info is valid. If not valid, it sends a pre-composed message
to the registrant complaining that they have breached their contract.


John (in response to question): The entire mail path it took to get to me. Open relay's
IP address, SMTP proxy IP addresses, traceroutes to get the IP block the spammer used.
Does a "dig" to extract the DNS info. It also un-obfusgates the URL's the spammers put
in their mail. Most URL's advertized in the spam mail goes to a totally tweaked URL,
making it all but impossible to do the whois to find out who they are. This program
unravels this url to get the REAL domain it's using. It then probes the spammer's gateway,
doing fingerprints to determine if it's a spammer's gateway, or an open one.


pare: Ah, what is the planned release date for spamcrunchers?


John: No official date yet, but we are working on it as hard as we can. Like there is
no tomorrow.


pare: Will this service be free or will there be a charge. And if so, how much are you
planning to charge?


John: It then keeps a record of all the opt in addresses. Invalid ones are marked, and sent
to FTC or cpamcop. It will be free for the 2-3 beta testers, but after initial testing and
shakedown, then we go commercial. We intend to charge for it.


pare: Are you worried about the new laws being passed that will outlaw spamming?


John: No - not at all. Spammers are just going to ignore the laws. Reguardless of what
they are. Spamming is an international problem to be worked out at economic summits. U.S.
laws are not going to stop spammers. Spammers just move offshore, like they have been
doing for the past four years. Most just go to China, setup their own spam relays, and
spam from there. Then they hire americans to spam for them. by giving them spam kits. And
programs they run that accesses the chinese servers.


pare: You mentioned that in the state of California, you can sue spammers. Are you starting
any Spam lawsuits, yourself?


John: Working on it. Getting confirmation is the problem. You better be darned sure you are
suing the right group. Not getting any cooperation from the government. Actually, it is a
federal law now that says you can sue spammers. Once I find the system they use, I still have
to find out who owns the system. Getting the provider to tell me that is very problematic. So
I go to the providers provider and work on them.


pare: How accurate do you think SMS will be at tracking down the right spammers?


John: As accurate as the user using it I suppose. It can and does nail down the IP address of
the spammers machine. And can tell with certainty that this is the spammers machine. but
determining the owner of the machine is the problem. There are two main ways of tracking
them down.

1.) Follow the mail path it took to get to me.
2.) Dig into the domain name info of the site the spammer promotes
3.) And one more - follow the money trail, but for me, being poor and morally not up to the
task of ordering that penis enlargment system.

We are also working on spam alert system. It's more on a system admin level. Involves the
Snort IDS.

Spam signatures can be written in such that if spam enters a protected network, the IDS
sends a message to spamcrunchers causing an alert, so the instant the spammer launches
their spammer system, the spamcrunchers sends an instant messenger alert to participating
ISP's to shut down the spam operation. Of course this would only happen if mail happened
to enter my network, and I know in advance the exact signature the spam message would
have.

This would be useful in situations where spammers messages are well known, and gives us
a way to fight the more prolific spammer, and perhaps allow us to catch them in "real time",
but cooperation of their ISP or internet provider is paramount.


pare: Do you expect any harassment from spammers that you are tracking down?


John: I'm already getting death threats. Yes...and this is yet another reason why I'm still
a little reluctant to go too public on this just yet.


pare: What kind of death threats?


John: I've been responsible for shutting down the HGH2000 site "As seen on NBC..." spam. Up
until about 2 years ago, I stopped allowing visitors to visit me in my home. Now I only
allow relatives and old friends to visit me where I live. Before that, I would invite anyone
to visit me, but when I learned of the Defcon threats, I changed my policy.

INTRODUCTION
------------

The following file is the first of a two part article of the Verizon codes
from the August 2001 release. Because of how many codes there are, we are
seperating it into two articles. the Error and Trouble Type codes are
in this article, and the rest of the codes, including Override Handle, 
Disposition, Cause, and test result codes.

I'm not sure how many of these codes are published, but I'm sure that they're
useful for something, so they will all be published.


Part I: Error Codes
-------------------

Error Code - Error Attribute - Explanation


0000 - Success - Transaction completed successfully.


0101 - Trouble Report Already Exists - A trouble report already exists 
on this line circuit.


0103 - Mandatory Attribute Missing - There is a required attribute missing 
from the message set or there is an attribute tag with no value. For Groups:
this error is reported only at the ground level. That is, only the group DD
tag will be listed and not the individual DD tags within the group. Will
occour on formatting errors.


0104 - Invalid Attribute Value - There has been an attribute edit failure.
For Groups: this error is reported only at the group level. That is, only
the group DD tag will be listed and not the individual DD tags within the
group. Will occour on formatting errors.


0201 - No Such Object Instance - Ticket does not exist. In case of end
customer originated queries will contain "Last Trouble Cleared Date =" with
the last trouble cleared date appended to it. Will occour when using Status
Inquiry, Modify, or Close transactions.


0301 - Cannot Verify Or Deny At This Time - Ticket is in a state of cleared;
no additional changes can be performed. Will occour when ticket is being
worked on by a Bell Atlantic employee.


0302 - Can Not Close - "Ticket cannot be closed." Trouble to be closing
pending work in progress message.


0303 - Trouble Report Change Denied - Ticket is in a state of cleared; no
changes allowed. Similar to Code 0301. Use same logic.


0304 - Line Condition Is Not Working Transaction Denied - The working
condition of the line is equal to "NWKG", "UNAS", "WKG LID", "DISC", or spaces.
The field will contain "Working Condition Of Line=" with the working condition
of the line appended to the message.


1001 - Processing Failure No Value - Will occour on system timeouts. Resubmit
transaction.


1002 - Fall-Back Reporting - A security error has been detected. circuit/owner
mismatch or circuit not found. Will occour when CKT ID cannot be found in
Bell Atlantic records.


1003 - Resource Limitation - Host OS not available; some link is broken. Similar
to Code 1001. Use same logic.


1004 - Access Denied or Access Failure - "A security error has been detected;
access to the system is disallowed. Will occour whenever your company is
|-s RSID/AECN is not marked as "owner" on Bell Atlantic Records."


1005 - Routing Failure - Unable to detect Request to the correct testing center.


1006 - Invalid Service Recovery Request - Service Recovery Request was denied.
For example: Predictor was down, Commitment has expired, the circuit was a PBX.


1007 - Commitment Request Failure - Commitment Modify Request was denied.


1008 - Invalid DSL Test Request - DSL Test Request was denied.

Ok, if you haven't heard about CCITT5 Trunks, I would hardly consider yourself an 
"international phreak". Basically, CCITT5 or System 5 is a software protocol used to route
telephone traffic. What is interesting to phreaks is that it is an INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOL,
and also it is analog. CCITT5 is the system loved by phreaks when they can get on it, 
because it is vulnerable and powerful. 

C5?

It is a blueboxable system. If you want to learn
how to bluebox it, I'm going to refer you to Echelon Magazine, which a UK zine focused on
CCITT5 blueboxing, but since it deals with international phreaking, it can be applied over
here as well. You should be able to find issues in the downloads section of TeamPhreak.


How can we bluebox from an SS7 served area?

The global PSTN, which the internet actually heavily relies on, connects various continents
and countries together with important gateways which then route to smaller offices. Each 
countries trunking throughout its land can be organized differently for differeant areas.
A common generic example is the T-1 trunks used in North America and Japan and the E-1
Trunks used over in Europe.

US country Directs

Switch software also varies from place to place around the globe. Because of this, gateways
need to be able to 'talk' to eachother and be able to translate information from digital to 
analog when necessary. An SS7 gateway has the capability of talking to a C5 system. When 
you call any of these numbers below your digital signalling from the SS7 packets is actually
converted to an analog format, into audible tones.

1-800-532-4462   China Direct (nice ringing!)
                 -Live Operator
		      -they hang up on me now! I call and hear "pleep!... plip!"

1-800-235-1154   Belize Direct:
                 -Automated Menu
			-Press 1 for Calling Card Call
			-Press 2 for Collect or Operator (ask to speak to a technician)

1-800-680-7622   Palau Direct: (quite possibly routed via sattelite)
		 -NCC Palau Direct Service
		 -Automated Prompt for Card #, 3 tries sucka :(

1-800-680-8363   Venezuela Direct
		 -Recording, but i believe asks to dial a number in spanish

Packet/MF Translation:

The tones they are translated to are commonly called MF tones which are NOT the same as on
the normal DTMF dialset. 

analog             digital        digital incoming                        analog
dial dtmf tones    SS7 packets    translated to MF digits outbound        MF tones
1-800-532-4462---->C.O.----------->International Gateway------------------>Inbound C5 system


It is commonly known that there are toll free numbers called "Home Country Directs" which
terminate in other countries. The previous numbers I gave you are all well-secured C5 country
directs. Toll free calls to other country? Pretty nice eh? Country Directs
are heavily monitored because keep in mind, they are still US numbers, the 1-800 number is
still located in the US. Thus Blueboxing off these is hard. What we are interested in are
Directs that go through a C5 link. These are clearly recognizable by their "pleep" upon
pickup and hangup. But if you find a C5 link that's only half the battle.

C5 links today:

Country Directs seem to be a waning, but ever slowly dying door to C5 boxing. They are nice
because you need to pass through a C5 link and it's totally free :) Abuse of Country Directs
has driven up monitoring and hanging up any call that passes "blocked tones" , which would be
any bluebox tones. I'm not sure if the US international gateways are doing the monitoring, or
if it is a little more specific to the number itself. I know DMS-100's have BlueBox detection
software to look for MF digits, but it isn't enabled by default. It is covered in an article
by di9ital in Ch4x Magazine Issue 5.

Most Country Directs are actually digital all the way through, to avoid any funny business to
begin with. Unfortunatly for phreaks, this means that probably calling directly to the country
rather than using a 1-800 is probably going to work out better. There are countries that are
C5 but have no 1-800 that take us there. Such as Libya and parts of Russia. 

There are even still trunks that accept incoming MF signalling INTO the United States, but
there are no outgoing stations that use analog signalling anymore. The real battle seems to
be getting into analog area when it seems like most of the gateways have been made to ensure
digital only signalling. 

Dialing Direct To Seize:

What needs to be done is different routing. Certain routes pass through C5 while others don't.
Venezuela actually has two directs, which both go to the same automated operator, but only one
goes through a C5 link, as obvious by the pleep.

+1-800-488-0058 "..Bienvenidos a servicio Venezuela Direto.."
+1-800-680-8363 "PLEEP!.. Bienvenidos...."

From some beige box experience and helping myself to dial various countries, I've discovered 
that routes are a little more variable, sometimes I go through C5, sometimes I don't, whereas
the Country Directs pretty much have set routes. 

Bouncing Your Call To Seize:

You might try bouncing your call via PBX, calling card or op that is located in another country.
Other countries have country directs as well, that are toll free as well. The US and UK directs
are pretty much brick walls when trying to bluebox today, but directs from other countries still
offer possibilities.

From Australia(CC +61) the following directs are C5:

1800881860            China Direct
1800881973            Bahrain Direct (SS7 from here) (nice ringing!)
1800881701            Russia Direct (SS7 from here) 
1800881682            Cook Islands Direct
1800881688            Tuvalu Direct

All SE'd by yours truly from the lovely Australia Telstra Direct operator.


So if you wanted to attempt to seize Russia?
First, lose your ANI for good measure, as once you reach inband trunks from overseas, 
without an ANI, it really  isn't about to be found without serious tracing methods like
tracing through electricity.

Your call would look like
