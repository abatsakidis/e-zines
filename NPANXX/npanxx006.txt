So, depending on where you goto school (if you even goto school)
then summer vacation is just about over. Hopefully you did a whole
lot of fun things during the summer. Maybe you confed until dawn,
maybe you stole a payphone. Well, whatever you did, it's just
about time for you to go back to school. And to get your education
started (we're only here for educational purposes afterall) we've
got a brand-spankin'-new issue of npanxx for ya. So, sit back,
relax, and read up before you have to go...sit...and...read-up.

y0 wazzup i'm j0o...im writing this article because #teamphreak needs
a cellular portion, and because my b0y pare asked me too.

The cellular telephone system consists of cellular telephones, cell sites, an M
TSO, and telephone 
company trunk lines. Service areas are divided into small regions called cells.
 Each cell is serviced 
by a low-powered transmitter/receiver called a cell site. Cell sites are strate
gically positioned 
throughout the coverage area to provide optimum coverage.
The number of cell sites in a service area is determined by the expected user t
raffic on the system. 
Each cell offers a maximum number of channels or talk paths, so high-traffic se
rvice areas may contain 
several cell sites. A cell site consists of a controller/computer, an antenna, 
a transmitter, a receiver
,and an emergency power supply. As the number of users increases, the capacity 
of the system can be 
increased through a process called cell splitting. Large cells are split into s
maller cells by adding 
new cell sites and reducing the power of the adjacent cells.

The Mobile Telephone Switching Office, or MTSO, houses the brain of the cellula
r system -- a computer, 
a switch, telephone trunk lines that connect to the local telephone company, an
d emergency generators 
to keep everything running in case of a power outage. Cell sites are connected 
to the MTSO over leased 
telephone lines or by microwave transmitters.


The MTSO sends a signal to all of the cell sites connected to it. Each cell sit
e tries to "page" the 
cellular telephone. The phone sends the MTSO a response signal. The MTSO determ
ines which cell site 
received the strongest signal from the cellular phone and connects the call.

A phone number is dialed into the cellular phone and the SEND key is pressed. A
 signal containing the 
number to be called, the number of the cellular phone, and its Electronic Seria
l Number, or ESN, is 
picked up by the nearest cell and transmitted to the MTSO.

The MTSO compares the cellular number and the ESN with its database and, if the
y correspond, the call 
is sent to the telephone company. If the ESN or the phone number are different 
than the numbers in the 
MTSO data base, the call will be blocked.

So if you were to ghost a number, the ESN and phone number would have to match.
 Which basically means
 you have to manipulate the phone to have both ESN with SID compatible to the n
earest cell.
Yes, this is illegal to do this. But programming a phone to send calls is possi
ble. You cannot receive
 calls because you are not actually assigned a number with an account for payin
g purposes. There is 
theory that this is possible and maybe someone with more advanced skills can do
 so, but for the newbie 
and moderate phreaker, I would think this information is enough.


What Is Ghosting?

Ghosting is getting free calls useing special numbers that do not require ESN
verification. Why these numbers exist is still a mystery, but infact they do ex
ist.
It is believed that telco uses they numbers for something, although what that i
s,
is not known. Every cellular phone has a keypad reprogram, to change your min.
www.cellularsecrets.net can help you with your phone.




How Do I Find These #s?

The way scanning is done is you look at area
code map and see codes around u then that will be 1st 3 #s
then start at 200 so just 4 example u have now 666-200-xxxx
the xxxx can be any #s u wish.
All working #s will be found between 200-999.
what u do is program that # in your phone
then try to make call if it doesnt work
then u go to 666-201-xxxx and so on this is how #s are found


Is Cellular Ghosting Dead In My Area?           

The way to find if the hole is patched is try programming different
npa/nxx in your fone if you keep getting 
"Welcome To Wireless Roaming" then the hole is probably patched.

Can you send me numbers for my area?

Fuck no, and don't post on bulletin boards asking for numbers either
you wont get anywhere. Just try scanning for them.

Whats the best phone for scanning?

Use an erriccson or an audiovox, those are the best for scanning ghost
numbers out.

For the longest time, I'd hear of these exploits that hackers were
commiting, and they would all have to do with something in the code
called the memory buffer. This article has been written by me, to
explain to you what memory buffer is, and why it is exploited. For
you leeto hackers out there, you might just want to skip this article.
This one is for the newbs.


Basically, when someone writes a piece of code, They want it to be a
clean piece of code that runs reasonably fast, and has no memory leaks.
If your program is taking up 90% of system resources, then your
program, in all likelyhood is a very bloated and inefficent piece of
code.


This is where the memory buffer comes in. Basically, what the memory
buffer does, is allow for the program to write a pre-determined
amount of memory to the RAM. This provides for the program to run
cleanly without memory leaks and without inefficency.


However sometimes programmers get a bit lazy. When you're coding
memory buffer, you must also close it off. Saying that it's
impossible to write anymore memory to the RAM, after you write x
amount of memory. However this is where a lot of programmers get
sloppy, and then they don't close off their buffer code.


And this is where the exploiting comes into play. When a programmer
doesn't close off the buffer code, then this allows the program to
write just about anything to the computer. This is where an exploit
makes it possible to write malicious code to the computer to make it
do whatever that program has permissions to do. If that program
happens to have root on a nix system, then in all likelyhood, you
will find this to be a root exploit.


Allow me to remind you that I'm no expert on these sorts of things.
However I have always wanted to know more about how people are able
to discover security holes and exploit them. From what I have learned
about security from various text files and other information resources,
this is what I know. Take it for what it's worth.

Belize, aka British Honduras is a central american country bordering Mexico and
 Guatemala,
with a coast on the Atlantic Ocean. Belize is a developing country, which is go
od for 
curious phreakers since they still utilize a lot of older telephone technology.

1) Belize codes
2) Signalling routes
3) Signalling information
4) End Notes


(I)

For such a small country Belize has a # of direct toll free connections
Belize Direct:
        From US-
                +1-800 746 1154 (MCI Trunk)
                +1-800 235 1154 (AT&T Trunk)
                +1-800 578 1154 (Sprint Trunk)
        From Canada-
                +1-800 463 1154
        From UK-
                0-800-890-501

If you manage to get KP1 access to Belize, or need a number to connect to to te
st 
things, Belize's city codes are:

        Belize City              2  
        Belmopan                 8 
        Benque Viejo Del Carmen  93  
        Corozal Town             4  
        Dangriga                 5  
        Independence             6  
        Orange Walk              3  
        Punta Gorda              7  
        San Ignacio              92  
        San Pedro                26 
        Stan Creek               5 


(2)

For calls from North America, the call will most likely go through one of the 1
2 major
LD signalling stations and make its way to a Central Office in West Palm Beach.
 Belize 
has no direct cable connection to anything off its coast, so either the call wi
ll be
done through microwave or sattelite, if it doesn't go through cable. However, t
he calls
to the directs seem fast enough to believe that most, if not all calls go via c
able.

From West Palm Beach, Submarine Cabling connects a variety of the carriebien in
 a fiesta
of coaxials and fiber optics, as heavily described in Faith 11 and Echelon issu
e 3.
The 2 most likely routes from West Palm Beach are 2 fiber optic connections:
The Colombus2 fiber connection to Cancun, Mexico or to Jamaica via Florida-Jami
ca fiber 
connection, then routed from Jamaica to Panama on the Jamaica-Panama fiber conn
ection.
If all channels of both fiber cables are used up, you have a good chance of rec
ieving a 
busy signal, but then again, your call could be routed all over the carribean.

From the UK, I would Guess that your call would make its way over to the NYC ar
ea via one
of the 7 fiber optic cables connection the North East USA to England, and then 
to Florida.
It is also possible for the call to go eastern towards europe, and then back ou
t to the 
atlantic, where it will connect to the carribien, then again, it could go to Be
rmuda, and
Sattelite or Microwave its way to the carribien.

Signalling information:

I am pretty sure that Belize is a CCITT5/R1 hybrid system, but it also has some
 digtital 
switching somewhere, digtal c5 on some, if not all by now. The international ga
teway 
does accept analog (inband) signalling however, which is where the fun comes in
.
Depending on the route, you could ocassionaly get an SS7 trunk into Belize, but
 that
almost never happens(as of 6/02).


Enter Belize blueboxing: sending your own clear forward, and seizing your own t
runk for
dialing away. This is theoretically possible since Belize definetly is a ccitt5
 country,
which is boxable. However, i have yet to successfully dialout on KP1 or KP2, al
though I 
have seized a trunk a few times. The timings for this system really change all 
the time,
however they are usually very fast, with no pause inbetween the Clear Forward a
nd Seize
tones. For those of you with bad memories, Clr Fwd is 2400/2600hz mixture, and 
Seize is
2400hz. These are for ccitt5 international signalling specifically. Theres PLEN
TY other 
files on c5, so i wont elaborate.

Most of the time i can't get even a successful seize, however, the switch does 
quirky 
things after blast tones such as:

-silence, blast again, busy signal, blast again, silence, etc. etc
-blast tones, single pleep back
-blast tones, click, pleep

*double pleep is successful trunk seize

Now you can't really do anything if you happen to get those responses, but I fo
und them
interesting. You really are talking one on one with the switch.

End Notes:

-Belize is always changing their systems, but they still remain to have inband 
signalling,
so don't give up.

-AT&T trunk is supersensitive in detecting 2600/2400 tones, i suggest MCI or Sp
rint.

-Belize doesn't seem like it's that practical of a country to bluebox INTO and 
call out 
from its internal switches. It could prove useful if you wanted to bluebox a ch
ain of
countries however, since the international gateway is analogue, the country's i
nternal
digital switches won't be touched, so your blueboxing hopefully won't be messed
 up.

Introduction:
-------------
I realise that there are many, many textfiles on the internet that deal with
the subject of redboxing. So why would I waste my precious time writing one
of my own? Well, for one thing, most redboxing texts on the net are poorly
written, and barely brush over the basics. (No offense to my fellow 
phreaks.)
But more importantly, I think that redboxing (although becoming obsolete)
is an important part of the history of fone phreaking. After all, many
newbies start out being drawn to the scene by the prospect of getting free
phone calls. This is'nt, of course, what being a phreak is all about; but
it's my opinion that most kids who start out with redboxes will eventually
develop an interrest & appreciation for other aspects of telephony.
So with that, on with the text!


History:
--------
First, I'll explain what "redboxing" is. When you walk up to a normal
everyday payphone, you have to deposit a quarter to make a call. If you
have'nt deposited a quarter, then the line remains closed & you can't
dial out. Why? Because of a little thing called ACTS. ACTS (Automated
Coin Toll Service) is a special type of signalling used on payphone
lines; which allows the CO (Central Office) to know when the proper
amount of money has been deposited. Once a coin has been deposited into
a payphone, the phone sends a short burst of tones down the line to the
CO, indicating how much money it detected in the hopper. The CO then opens
up the line, allowing you to dial your number. Once you hang up, your
coin falls from the temporary hopper to the coin box; and the line is
once again in it's "closed" state, awaiting another coin.

This, of course, is the principle behind redboxing. By simulating
the ACTS tones, and playing them into the mouthpiece of a payphone,
we can "fool" the CO into thinking a quarter has been deposited,
thus opening up the line for free. Cool, right?

There are many different variations upon the design of redboxes, but by
far the most common is the modified Radio Shack tone dialer. Some people
use small tape recorders, some people use MP3 players, some people use
integrated circuit recorders, like those little "memo keychains" you can
get at Radio Shack. However, it's my belief that the Radio Shack tone dialer
design is still the best. It's cheaper than an MP3 player, much more durable
than a tape recorder, and will give a much higher quality signal than an IC
recorder. The signal will never deteriorate, since you're working purely 
with
hardware. Therefor, the plans I have in this text will deal with the tone
dialer design only. There are many different variations on this design,
depending upon which model dialer you buy (or which added features you 
want);
so I'll try to list as many URL's as I can for other designs in the 
"Resources"
section later on in this text.

Due to many Telco's making use of newer, high-security payphones,
redboxing is starting to become obsolete in North America. However,
many areas are still using standard payphones. Even in larger cities,
you can still find older, redboxable payphones if you just look around.
A redboxer's main enemy is a muted mouthpiece, so just pick up the
receiver and blow into the mouthpiece. If you can hear your breath
being amplified, then you can probably use a redbox on that payphone.
You'll soon be able to identify the different models of payphone in your
area & which ones are redboxable.

Before I begin, I just want to clear a few things up. Redboxing will
ONLY work with payphones, so you can't use it to refill you pre-paid
mobile account with AT&T. You also can't use it to access phone sex
lines, so forget about it. Redbox tones are'nt some kind of universal
telephone currency; but they will help you make free local & long
distance phone calls from a payphone. If you've just rented "Hackers",
then please disregard that retarded scene where Razor and Blade describe
how to "redbox" a payphone. It won't work. Also, don't hand this in as
your grade 10 science experiment - redboxing is a crime. Just thought
I'd clear that up, so that I can deflect the stupid e-mail questions.


Redboxing in the USA:
---------------------
Unlike Canada, the United States seems to be slow to replace it's
payphones with newer high-security phones such as the Nortel Millenium
series. Therefor, redboxing is still very much alive in most parts
of America. Here, I'll describe how to build an American redbox,
using rather inexpensive parts that you can easily obtain at your
local Radio Shack. The only component you may have trouble finding
is the 6.5536 MHZ crystal; but you can buy these very cheaply online from
RedBoxChilliPepper, founder of the Phone Losers of America. You
can visit his site at <http://phonelosers.org>

Due to the ample room inside it's housing, the best model of Tone
Dialer to work with is Radio Shack part #43-146 33-memory pocket
tone dialer. It may be labelled with the Radio Shack brand, the
Tandy brand, or even the GenEXXA brand - it does'nt matter. They're
all the exact same product. You can buy these at any Rat Shack for
10 or 15 bucks, which is quite cheap considering how much it'll save
you over time. If they don't have it in stock, just give them the
part number & they'll be more than happy to order one in for you.
...Just don't tell them what you plan to do with it - remember:
redboxes are illegal devices, and the guy behind the till probably
won't order it for you if you tell him your plans. In fact, he may
threaten to call the cops. (Highly unlikely, but ya never know.
Don't be a knucklehead.)


Items you'll need:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
º 33-memory pocket tone dailer (RS #43-146)
º Soldering iron
º Wire strippers (or just a knife)
º Solder
º Needle nose pliers would help
º Coffee
º Electrical tape
º A black marker
º 6.5536 MHZ Crystal
º Small screwdriver
º Some thin gauge wire (phone line will work)
º Fun-tack or glue or anything sticky
º Patience

Assuming you have a basic knowledge of electronics, you should
have no trouble modifying the dialer. All you're doing is
removing one crystal, and replacing it with another. The only
way you can screw this up is if either a) you fry the circuit
board with the soldering iron, or b) if you don't line up
the components properly & end up crushing the crystal while
closing it back up. Follow these notes & you should be fine.

Okay, now lay everything out on a table somewhere, and maybe
play some Chemical Brothers in the background for ambience.
The first thing you need to do is remove all the screws.
There are 2 on the outer housing, and 4 under the battery
door. As with all electronics projects, I suggest you keep
the screws in an empty coffee cup so you don't lose them.
I also suggest you keep a full coffee cup nearby, so that
you'll have some tasty coffee to drink.

Now carefully run a screwdriver or knife in between the two
halves of the housing, and gently pry them apart. Be careful,
or you'll snap off the speaker wires. Open it up, and lay the
two halves down side by side. You may as well remove the two
tiny switches as well, and keep them in the cup with your
screws. Assuming you're looking at the dialer right-side-up,
you'll find your crystal in the bottom left-hand side, near
the battery compartment. It's the thin silver cylindar looking
component. It'll be glued down, so use your screwdriver or knife
to cut away the glue underneath. Once your soldering iron is
heated up, melt the crystal's solder points & remove it from the
board. Once this is accomplished, flush the crystal down your
toilet & forget it ever existed.

The next thing you'll want to do is remove the red LED from the
top right corner of the board - you'll need that space for other
stuff. Okay, here's where the delicate work comes in... I'm going
to make you do something that other FAQ's would'nt, but trust me:
doing this makes everything fit inside alot better.

Look down near the bottom of the board, in the center. You see that
fat yellow component sticking up? I'm going to get you to remove
that. (I'm not really an electronics wiz, but I think that's a
capacitor. Capacitors need to be wired up using the correct polarity,
unlike crystals, so you want to remember how this thing was wired
up.) Mark the top of the component (the part you can see, that is)
with a black marker. Then gently cut away the glue from underneath
it. You can use the pliers to lift it a bit while you do this.
Once the glue is loose, use your soldering iron to remove the
capacitor. (If this is'nt a capacitor, don't e-mail me to make fun
of me. I don't care. For the sake of this article, we'll just
assume it's a capacitor.)

The next thing I want you to do is measure out about 3 inches of
wire & bare the ends. If you're using phone line, then you can
even color code your work so you don't get mixed up! Once you
have your wire measured out, attach one end of each wire to
the capacitor's original solder points. Keeping in mind which
way the capacitor was originally attached (you DID mark the
top of it with a marker, did'nt you?), solder the correct wires
to the corresponding leads on the capacitor. Once that's done,
use a bit of electrical tape to insulate the solder points on
the board, and wrap up the capacitor as well. Why did I make
you run wire between the circuit board and the capacitor?
Well, we're going to move it so that we can make room for
the new crystal, silly. If you're looking at your dialer
the way I'm looking at mine, the battery compartment is on
the bottom, the circuit board half is on the right hand side,
and the speaker half is on the left hand side. Look over at
the speaker half, near the screw on the top left hand side.
See that empty space up there? I want you to use some fun-tack
or something to stick the capacitor up there. ...That's why
we removed the LED - so that the capacitor would fit in that
corner once we closed up the dialer. Another reason for
removing the LED is because it's completely useless & drains
your batteries for no good reason. All it does is make a
little red light come on when you turn on your dialer.

Now we start on the new crystal. It does'nt matter which lead
goes where, since polarity does'nt matter at all with crystals.
Since the leads on your new crystal are far too long, grab some
wire cutters & clip them so that they're only about one CM long.
Measure out 2 more pieces of wire, about 3 inches long. Solder
one end from each of them to the old crystal's solder points
on the circuit board, and solder the other ends to the 3.5536
MHZ crystal's leads. Insulate everything with electrical tape,
then grab a bit more fun-tack. Look at the speaker half of
the dialer again. Over on the far left hand side, between
the speaker and the battery compartment, there's a small
space that's the exact size & shape of a 3.5536 MHZ crystal.
What a coincidence! Put a bit of fun-tack in the corner there,
and lay your crystal down sideways - with the leads pointing
towards the center of the unit. Ya see how well that fits in
there??? That's why I'm making you move the capacitor over,
unlike other textfiles I've seen. ...It just fits better this
way. Trust me - you'll thank me when you're closing it up.
This way it's nearly impossible to fuck up & crush components.

You might want to tape the wires down a little bit before you
try closing it up; they tend to come loose & pull the crystal
& capacitor out of place if you don't. (I learnt this the hard
way.) Double-check to make sure you insulated all of your
work. It's going to be a pain in the ass to open this back
up & troubleshoot if you did'nt.

Now comes the hard part. You're going to try to close the
unit back up. I suggest relaxing for a minute first & drinking
a nice cup of coffee. If you're a smoker, now's the time to
take a break and light up.

...Now that you've taken a breather, prepare to start swearing.
Thanks to the dumb little switches on this model of dialer, it'll
take you a few tries before you can get everything back together
again. Since I made you move everything around, though, you don't
have to worry about crushing any components at least. Now reach
into your handy dandy cup, and take out your 2 switches. If you've
gotten this far, then you're obviously not a total idiot, so
I'll just assume you can figure out which way the switches have
to lay when you put them back in. Once you have them in place,
you kinda have to hold them so that they are'nt at an angle,
then carefully try to close the two halves back together.
Be sure not to pinch any of your wires between the two halves,
or you'll have to start over from the begining. Hahahahahaha.

Once you get it closed up, put the screws back in & put in
some AAA batteries. With the "ON/OFF" switch to "ON", and the
"STORE/DIAL" switch to "DIAL", press some of the keys on
the keypad. You should be able to hear some really high
pitched tones. If not, then you messed something up & you're
an embarassment to phreaks everywhere. Hahahahahahahahaha.

Okay, you got the new crystal in; now you have to program the
thing. We'll be using the 3 priority buttons on the top, for
"nickels" "dimes", and "quarters". In the United States, the
"redbox" tones are dual-tone frequencies consisting of a
1700 hz tone and a 2200 hz tone. Here's the timing of the
tones, cut & pasted from <http://phonelosers.org>:

<!--- Stolen Text ---!>
A nickel is 66 ms on (1 beep).
A dime is 66ms on, 66ms off, 66ms on (2 beeps).
A quarter is 33ms on, 33ms off repeated 5 times.
<!--- Stolen Text ---!>

Using a converted tone dialer actually creates a timing that's
slightly slower than that, but it does'nt matter. It'll still
work, I promise. To get the correct frequencies, you'll be
programming in a string of tones using the * (star) key. Turn
the unit's power on, and slide "DIAL/STORE" to "STORE". Press
the following keys:

MEMORY, *, *, *, *, *, MEMORY, P1.

Slide the switch back to "DIAL", and press "P1". That's your
quarter tone. Now switch it back to "STORE" and press:

MEMORY, *, *, MEMORY, P2.

Switch it back to "DIAL" & press "P2". That's a dime. "STORE"
again & press:

MEMORY, *, MEMORY, P3.

That's a nickel. There you go. Great. So now you have a redbox.
Just don't bloody get caught with it at a border checkpoint or
an airport, or you'll have some explaining to do. (Assuming
whoever finds it has the slightest clue what it's used for.)
Now go find a payphone with an un-muted mouthpiece, and play
a quarter tone into the receiver. Call up one of your freinds
and tell them how 31337 you are. Just remember not to be too
obvious when you're using your redbox. Normal everyday lamers
may have no clue what you're doing, but you just might end
up being seen by an off-duty Telco lineman, who will promptly
kick your ass and/or call the cops. Be careful.


Redboxing in Canada:
--------------------
If you're a Canuck like me, then you won't be too pleased with
what I'm about to say... Unless you live in a small town, you
might not be able to use a redbox. Most Canadian cities have
started using Nortel Millenium payphones, which kill the
possibility of redboxing. You see, a plain old payphone works
as such: The mouthpiece is NOT muted, and it sits on a special
type of line used only for payphones. It makes use of these
lines so that coin toll signalling is possible. (Note: Point
of interrest, Canada does'nt use ACTS format tones, so a Radio
Shack tone dialer won't do you any good.) A Nortel Millenium,
on the other hand, works as such:

1) The mouthpiece is muted from the point you pick up the receiver
until the point that the line starts ringing on the other end,
making redboxes useless.

2) When you pick up the receiver, you are'nt hearing an actual
dialtone. The line is still on-hook, and what you're hearing is
simply a recording of a dialtone that the phone's computer is
playing into the earpiece. Very clever. After you deposit a quarter
(a REAL quarter), you press the corresponding buttons on the keypad
for the phone number you want to dial. Once again, those are just
recordings of DTMF (Dual-tone Multi-frequency) tones that you're
hearing.

3) Once you "dial" your number, and the payphone has determined
that you've deposited enough money, it puts the line off-hook
and dials the number for you. Once the line starts to ring,
the mouthpiece is un-muted.

4) Unlike a normal payphone, a Millenium is on a POTS (Plain
Old Telephone Service) line, like the one in your house. It
won't use coin toll signalling at all, so forget about it.

Despite this horrible news, please keep in mind that Nortel
Milleniums are a rather brilliant advancement in the field
of telephony. Rather than just reading textfiles on the internet,
you can use this technology to make your own name in the H/P
scene. Study these phones closely, and I'm sure you can invent
your own little gadgets & become famous.

However, it's not as if every payphone in Canada is a Millenium.
There are plenty of places where you can still find good old
fashioned payphones, which can still be plundered with "redbox"
tones. The tones you'll be using are a bit different than the
ones used in the USA, though. They are as follows (swiped once
again from <http://phonelosers.org>):

<!--- Stolen Text ---!>
A nickel is 2200hz, 0.06s on,
A dime is 2200hz, 0.06s on, 0.06s off, 0.06s on, 0.06s off (2 beeps).
A quarter is 2200hz 33ms on, 33ms off repeated 5 times.
<!--- Stolen Text ---!>

As with many things, we don't have it as easy as the Americans when
it comes to redboxing. A simple tone dialer mod won't cut it. You'll
need to get a recording device of some kind (as high quality as you
can afford), and record the following file to it:

<http://axion.0catch.com/sounds/CANredbox.wav>

In the event that my site has moved from 0catch.com, you can also
find the file at:

<http://phonelosers.org/sound/redbox_25_canadian.wav>

...That's a Canadian quarter tone. Coincidentally, it's worth
approximately 12 cents when translated to American tones.
After you've recorded a bunch of quarter tones into your
recording device, I recommend going to an electronics store
and trying to find a suction cup telephone microphone, to
ensure the best playback quality. When you're bored, you
can use the little suction cup to give yourself tiny round
hickies all over your body. Fun for all!

Yeah. So just look around your city and try to figure out what
type of payphones you have in your area. If the phone is plain
looking and brown, it's probably a normal old-fashioned
payphone. If it's silver & space-age-looking, with a nice LCD
display & a yellow card reader, then it's a Millenium & you
can forget about it. If you happen to find a REALLY wierd
looking phone with a keyboard & a full-color screen displaying
an internet browser, then you probably live in a huge city.
On the down side, you can't redbox a web-phone, but on the plus
side you can come back later with a crowbar & bring that mean
machine home with you! :) If you're a Canadian & can't find any
payphones that you can redbox, don't get angry. It's not the
bloody end of the world, okay? There are plenty of other kewl
exploits for us that the Americans can't enjoy. For instance:
AT&T Elcotel series phones can be hacked by dialing up a toll
free out of service number! ...But I'll save that for another
textfile. Just remember, there's more to life than redboxing.


Conclusion:
-----------
Well, if all went as planned, you're now able to screw the phone
company & impress all your freinds with your cool new toy.
I suppose you could call it your "ACTS Quarter Tone Emulation
Device" if you wanted, but "Redbox" makes you sound more leet.
If you already knew how to make a redbox, then hopefully you
enjoyed my revised design, or at least maybe you were entertained
by my fabulous writing skillz. If this was the first time you've
built a Redbox, then you've done something fun & learnt a bit
about the world. Remember: no matter how secure anyone says
something is, there's always a way to fuck it up. In this case,
there's a really EASY way to get around coin tolling. That's
why I think newbies seem attracted to Redboxing - it's a good
starting point since it's not very difficult. If you ARE a noob,
please remember this: phreaking is'nt just about getting free
phone calls. Sure, that's nice, but a true phreak is somebody
who has an honest interrest in the world of telephony. Otherwise,
you're just some punk kid trying to steal phone calls. Please
don't forget about that.

...With great power .....Comes great responsibility.

Introduction:
-------------



Before I go into detail about this article, I'd like to state that this
article was written to only show how easily an attack could be made on
what may be the most important invention that the world has seen since
the industrial revolution. The Internet. If the internet were to be
attacked, and brought down, America, along with multiple other countries
which rely on it for EVERYTHING would be brought to their knees. This
article is only being written in a hypothetical sense, and it is not the
intention of any member of Team Phreak, or any contributing member of
NPANXX for this article to be published with any other intentions. We
only hope that this article will be taken seriously, so that people
recognize how easily an attack could be made.


This article is being written in two parts. The first part is being written
by bor, and will focus on the ability to, and how you would go about taking
down the internet. How easy it would be, and the basic theory behind it.
Part II will contain example code written by Visual showing how this
theoretical virus would search the internet.



Imagine One Day:
----------------


Imagine that one day, you're on the internet, and for some reason, at
the time, you think that your downloading of mp3's are going a bit slow.
Maybe you're only getting 15k/sec rather than your usual 70-80. You figure
that it's just a little congestion, there is a backbone down, or something
like that.


However as time goes on, your recognize that maybe you start slowing down
even more. It seems subtle, you don't notice a big problem. You don't really
start getting pissed off until about a week later. Your downloads are only
going at about 10k/sec. You figure that the cable company, or your ISP should
have fixed whatever is wrong by now. You call them up...They have no idea why
it's like that. Even their blazing fast connections are slower than usual.
No one can figure it out.


Imagine that weeks go by. Your internet connection slows to below what the
normal dialup user sees. Dialup users can't even use the internet because
it's impossible for them to connect. websites slow to a halt. Servers cannot
communicate with DNS servers...All domains are down. E-mail doesn't work
because e-mail servers can't communicate with eachother. NOTHING is working.



How This All Happened:
----------------------



If you're familiar with linux, then you know that there is a little program
called wget. wget is a great program. Simply type "wget blah.com/meh.xxx" and
wget will get it for you in a snap. wget also has many functions. Including the
function to fetch all pages, images, and links associated with those pages. Not
to mention links to those pages, and links to those pages, and so on.


Lets hypothetically say that someone includes that ability of wget into a worm.
This ability is specifically set in the worm to visit google.com, and multiple
other search engines and use the search term which gets the most hits from goog
le,
and then visit EVERY site which comes from that hit...and then it would visit e
very
site, and then visit every site from there.


Did we mention that it spreads itself? Of course it spreads itself. It's a worm
. It
has multiple ways of spreading. Not only does it send itself to spammers, every
one in
your address book, and mailing lists, but it uses p2p networks to spread itself
 via
infected applications, mp3s, and movies. It has multiple spreading processes wh
ich
all work together to spread the virus to as many people as possible.


The worm doesn't do all of its visiting to everything at once. It selects a ran
dom time
of the day when the computer is on to do it's bidding. If it visited every site
 on google all
at once, it would simply take servers down, and the purpose would be lost. Howe
ver if
it does it at different queries, on different engines then the slowing down of 
the internet 
would be ongoing,constant, everywhere. You wouldn't be bottlenecking the traffi
c in one place. 
Did we  also mention that it doesn't only use google, but it selects multiple s
earch engines?
It selects between yahoo, google, altavista, dogpile, and others.


The worm does nothing to let the user of the infected computer to know its ther
e. It
slows down when the computer is in use, when it's idle, it goes full blast. The
 user
is never aware that it's there, but it's always working. Always spreading with 
every
email. It's always visiting websites, always congesting the internet.



Could This Happen?:
-------------------



Sure it could. Why not? How hard would it really be to write a piece of code wh
ich used
an already existing feature to a piece of software, and use it for it's own bid
ding? How
hard would it really be to find a way to multiply itself to as many computers a
s possible
by multiple means? How hard would it really be to get this to millions of compu
ters around
the world?


It wouldn't be very hard. All it would take is someone with a bit of knowledge,
 creativity,
and an initial way of getting it to a mass of people. There would be nothing to
 keep anyone
from doing this. And the internet could not take something from millions of peo
ple around
the world visiting every every image of every page of every site of every searc
h engine.


I suppose that the main question is "Would this work?" The answer is yes and no
. It would
totally work if it got to enough computers. Like visual kindly pointed out, mil
lions of
people are on the internet every day. You would have to get this theoretical vi
rus to
millions, if not billions of computers, and they would all have to be working a
t the same
time. Remember, the goal of this worm isn't to take down individual servers, an
d google.
The goal of this worm would be to take down entire backbones. Once you take dow
n the
backbones, the internet is helpless. Everything which feeds off that backbone i
s multiple
times slower than the backbone iteslf. If the backbone's are so congested with 
traffic that
they're horribly slow, then everyone else is horribly slower than that. 


In theory, This could bring the internet to it's hypothetical knees.



                                                              - bor. (bor@teamp

    **PAST**

        Once upon a time (year 2000) there was a stoner named "Merlion" 
 he was  from the Team Virus group. He decided to do a telecommunications split
 
 off of Team Virus and name it "Team Phreak".  Merlion wasn't a phreak and didn
t
 have the drive or determination to start a group so he handed it over 
 to his first and only member at the time, Parenomen.  Parenomen took the 
 group with open arms and sat with it for some time.  All he did with his 
 time is think about how he can make this group successful.  Once he figured 
 out he needed actual members, he pulled the lamest thing he could think of.
 He started to recruit people off irc.2600.net.  
 
        Team Phreak's very first member was a kid named Fantacmet.  Fantacmet 
 was the weirdest person you will ever meet on the internet.  He believed 
 there were taps all over his house and one even on his lawn mower.  
 Once Parenomen "forgot" about fantacmet he went to go recruit some more 
 members off irc.2600.net,he came two guys named Pr0t and PPCpunk. They 
 joined up for about 2 weeks, and then later dropped.  After a long 
 time of inactivity, Team Phreak started to pick up.  The Clone joined
 and he invited some of his friends, Magma, Alan, Tek250.  

         Once The Clone joined things picked up; we got a domain 
 www.teamphreak.org.  Phractal and Bor from www.phonelosers.net 
 joined as well.  We also had a guy named Lyceria aka POS_RLS join 
 he was a former bellsouth operator.  After a month or two of this 
 disaster struck.  

        The Clone and Parenomen got into a fight, and they split the group up i
nto
  two divisions; one was "Hell South" and the other was named
 "Team Phreak". The Clone had control of Team Phreak and Parenomen had
 control over Hell South.  This did obviously didn't work out, and The Clone 
 eventualy left the group.  All of his friends followed.  Team Phreak's
 only members were Parenomen, Lyceria, Bor, Phractal, Alan, and Tekk250.  
 After a few months of inactivity and fights we were reduced to Lyceria, 
 Bor, Phractal, and Parenomen.  

**PRESENT**

        The summer of 2002 has been the most productive summer we have
 ever seen.  We are being featured in an actually magazine for the H/P
 community.  We have also started our own zine named NPAnxx.  It has 
 been very successful and will become even more succesfful.   We have 
 also gained a member, his name is stain.  When he first joined he was
 very excited and registered www.teamphreak.net and set us up a IRCD.
 He has become inactive because he is very busy running a local ISP.
   
   
**FUTURE**

        Only 4 original members remain.  Team Phreak will try to remain 
 current and alive.  But, we are not nieve. We all realize that it's just 
 a group and groups die.  Untill "we bite the big one" we will always be 
 comming out with new issues of NPAnxx.  We ask you all to join us on EFNet 
 (irc.vrfx.com) #TeamPhreak and become a Team Phreak groupie.
 Well, my article is comming to a conclusion and I would like to personally 
 thank everyone who has ever been affiliated with Team Phreak!
