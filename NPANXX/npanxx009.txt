Well, long time no see, eh? Out of the darkness I come, to write you an
introduction to an issue that I had absolutely no part of in creating.
Although I guess the same thing could be said about issue 008, I really
had no imput at all in this issue. So, where have I been you ask?

Well, my computer got screwed up about 5 or 6 months ago. Power supply
went out on it, bought a new one, installed it, and it shorted out. When
that power supply shorted out, something happened to either the motherboard
or something else on the computer. The whole problem with this, is that it
takes money to fix. So, I'll just wait awhile longer and either get it fixed
or buy a new computer. Although that hard drive has a whole lot of useful
stuff on it.

So anyways, npanxx009 is finally here, and all 14 of you that visit the site
daily should find it to be a decent issue. It's a little light on articles, but
I'm sure that pare made up for it in heart, or something like that. 

I'm going to go finish updating the site so I can upload this bad boy. By the way,
thanks for the cover graphic, vap.

P.S. - As Always, continue to send in articles. We get articles from the same
people all the time, and we could really use some more diversity in the author's
who write our articles.

This file will deal with the physical aspects of telephone and room  
Monitoring. It also lays down some basic concepts of all bugging and 
Covert monitoring.

*-*To bug or monitor there are three main parts of the operation.

1. Data Extraction. Data Extraction or DE for short is typically the 
hardest part of the operation. DE is anything that makes the media 
recordable and/or hides the presence of the device from the monitored party. 
Radio Shack makes a nice tool for this phase. The catalog number is 
43-228, it will cost you about $22.00. Do not buy the cheap one (cat 
number43-1237) because it is meant to be put between a telephone and a 
handset. The line there is conditioned. And placing the cheaper bug on a 
normal telephone line will result in an annoying buzz on the line and a 
poor recording. This buzz will also make the phone line useless and when 
the monitored party picks up they phone they will immediately know that 
something is up.

2. Data Transport. Data Transport or DT is the media that moves the 
data from DE stage to the DR stage. DT encompasses everything from a wire 
between a microphone (DE) and a tape recorder (DR). It also can be a 
wireless link using a FRS radio. The DE in that scenario would encompass the 
wires from the microphone to the radio (1), the radio's themselves, and 
the wire from the radio (2) to the DR phase.    

3. Data Recording. Data Recording or DR for short is what DT feeds 
into. DR is anything that records data for later use.  DR can encompass a 
tape recorder, MP3 player thats capable of recording, a reel to 
Reel (although these are old if thats all you have then thats all you can use). 
Go to Wal-Mart and buy the fancy tape recorder with the record control 
on it. All you need for this phase is a device thats capable of 
recording from a microphone input and also is set on voice activated recording.  

The rule of thumb is the night is the best time to place the bug.
Also get ariel photography of the area and then visit the area and draw 
out the phone boxes and other important things (dogs cages/houses, 
barbed wire, fences, these are some things that ariel photos do not reveal.) 
Ariel photography is available from Microsoft's Terraserver. 

The following will go through the details of telephone bugging. If your 
target is rural the task will be very simple. It is dark in rural areas 
and people drive like hell on dark country roads. These people are 
actually a smaller threat then you think, they are night blind from there 
own headlights!!!!!. Unless the lights are directly on you then you 
should be good. If it is an open area then you should be able to see cars 
in the distance, hide if you think your a little close to the road.  If 
you keep a minium amount of light for you to actually see to place the 
bug then you will be better off. Night vision would probably be awesome 
but I have never personally used night vision (to expensive).  Some rural 
areas will actually have the customer demarcation point as a very 
visible box in front of the property. Opening this box will reveal wire 
terminals. These terminals are where you will attach the Data Extraction 
phase of the bug. From there you can either put a small tape recorder on 
voice activated recording or what ever you want. It is advised that you 
put the components from the three phases together at your house and 
test it out. 
Some questions to ask yourself are: 
Is the recording a quality recording? 
When I pick up the phone are there any other buzzes and what ever on 
the phone then before?

1x-1x-xxx List


This is A list of 10-1x-xxx Numbers. Some people call these 'Dial Around

Servives' I've even heard people call these 'ten ten' numbers in some places.  

 



You've heard them on the Radio and Televison ads like 10-10-321 they say

you get a 20 minunite fone call for 99 cents and 7 cents for each minunite

after. Well some companys put hidden Fee's to these numbers apon connection 

with your party. These charge's include per-call access fees, minimum usage fees,

changing per-minute rates, monthly service charge, and PICC/USF fees. Always contact 

the service provider before using the service to avoid any surprise charges. 

 



Monthly Minimum Usage Charge

This fee is charged by some carriers if your specific rate plan has volume requirements, 

meaning that you must make a certain dollar amount of calls per month. For example, a plan 

may require that you make at least $20.00 a month worth of phone calls. If you do not make 

$20.00 worth of calls, the carrier will charge you the difference as a fee. If, for instance, 

your plan requires a $10.00 minimum per month and you only made $5.00 of calls, you would see 

the remaining $5.00 as a monthly charge. The Monthly Minimum differs from the Monthly Service 

Fee.  



*Key* 



PICC - Presubscribed Interexchange Carrier Charge

USF - Universal Service Fund Charge

*Note*

Not all the numbers in this list will work for the simple fact that that some can only be reached 

in cerent area's

Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've noticed over the last few years that as the web gets more
and more commercial, you're seeing far fewer "free" webspace
providers out there; and the ones that still exist are often
very annoying to use - what with the growing number of forced
pop-ups & hotlinking restrictions for image files...

Being the cheap bastard that I am, I've never been able to
just give up and PAY for web-hosting services, so I've been
stuck having to settle for 3'rd rate hosts like 0catch.com
and Geocities.com for my websites. Sadly, my penny-pinching
ways have meant that my website has been littered with ads
for webcams and online casinos. On top of this frustration,
most of these free providers have filters to prevent people
from hotlinking to images hosted on their servers. Now, I
don't know about you, but my idea of a good time on a Friday
night consists of hanging out at message boards and posting
photoshopped pictures of George Bush with a penis in his
ear. So obviously, this whole hotlinking issue is an ongoing
battle for me.

Well, it just so happens that I've found a solution to both
of these problems, and the key lies within the most basic
of all computer files, the unformatted .txt file...


Problem 1 - Hotlinking:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As I've said, I have a real penchant for going to message
boards and posting animated gifs of Optimus Prime trans-
forming. Using your average free webspace provider (Geo-
cities in this example), their servers' software would
detect that you were hotlinking to an image file, and
you'd just end up seeing an error message rather than
the intended image. As a message board moderator, I've
noticed that the most popular avatar among most posters
is a tiny white square with a tiny red "x" in the center.
After the usual self-righteous teasing on my part, I'll
explain the same process I'm about to describe here:

Step One: Using Internet Explorer (or whatever web browser
you use), open up whatever image it was that you wanted
to store online.

Step Two: Click on "File", then "Save As". Select an easy
to remember location to save your file, like Desktop. On
the bottom of that window, you'll see two options: the one
on the top is for altering the file name, and the one below
it is for choosing a file format. Just disregard that last
one: we can force a format upon a file simply by typing
the file extension after the filename. (Note: If this
doesn't work for some reason, just select "All Files" and
proceed with my instructions.) For the image's file name,
type in "example.txt", then click "Save". If you look at
your Desktop now, you should see the example.txt file,
complete with a .txt file icon. If you try to open the
file by double-clicking on it, you'll just get a bunch
of nonsense hex code - don't worry about that. Just leave
the file alone and move on to Step #3.

Step Three: Assuming you've already got an account at a
free webspace provider, go to that site and log into your
account. Go to your file manager, and upload the .txt
file from your desktop.

Step Four: Sit back and drink a cup of coffee, then type
the address of your newly uploaded .txt file into the
address bar of your web browser. Be careful not to spill
your coffee all over when you excitedly notice that you're
viewing your image in all it's glory - even though it's
technically a .txt file.

Step Five: Go to your favorite message board, and create
a post with your new image embedded. The formatting codes
differ from board to board, but your post should probably
be something like this:

[IMG]http://geoshitties.com/me/example.txt[/IMG]

Now, you might be left wondering: 1) Why would the .txt
file show up as an image, 2) Why doesn't it get picked
up by the hotlinking filters, and 3) "Why the hell didn't
I think of that?!?"

The reason for the image showing up properly is because
by saving your image as a .txt file, the image's hex
remains completely unformated, and can be converted back
to an image format later on without damaging the file at
all. When you open that .txt file using your web browser,
the browser software identifies the hex as being an image
file, and will automatically convert it into a viewable
form. (This is the same reason that your web browser will
display a web page in HTML format, rather than just
opening up the source code in a raw text format.)

And since webspace providers are only really worried about
people hotlinking to image files - since it eats up your
bandwidth quickly; they could care less about someone
linking to a measly little .txt file. So far, I've yet to
find a free provider that wouldn't let you hotlink to a
.txt format image file, not even geocities or angelfire.


Problem Two - Those Pesky Ads:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's almost impossible these days to find a free webhost
that provides a half-decent amount of storage space,
without littering your website with pop-ups and banner
ads. The webspace provider will definately force ads upon
any HTML files you store on your account, but they usually
won't force ads on regular .txt files. Why not? Because
in order to include an ad in one of your files, they have
to alter the format to HTML and include the link to the
ad in the source code. This creates an obvious problem,
since converting a .txt file to a .html file will really
mess up the formatting, and the text won't show up properly.
You'll already know this if you've ever tried including some
of your mad ASCII art in one of your site's pages.

I'm sure by now most of you have already figured out what
I'm getting to, but I'll explain it anyways...

Write the source for your webpage as per usual, but instead
of saving it as an HTML file, save it in .txt format. Upload
it to your website's account, and reopen it using your
browser. As you'll see, your page is now completely ad-free,
but it diplays as a proper HTML file. This works for the
same reason the image trick works - the source remains intact,
and your browser displays it in all it's glory. The only real
problem with this is that you can't display images on your
webpage... However, if your website is an H/P site, you most
likely have no real need to be embedding images into your
website anyways, unless it's to show off your wikkid logo
on your index page. If it's that important, then just get
off j00r lazy ass and code yourself an ASCII logo. Besides,
that'll just make you look more 1337. If you really need to
use an image for something, there's no reason why you can't
just link to the file using the "A HREF" tag.


Problem Three - Your Awkward Domain Name:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you have a great new website, you might want to
get yourself a new domain name. There are two reasons for
this: First, using http://geoshitties.com/me/index.txt
as your website address will mean that nobody will ever
bother remembering the address. Secondly, and more import-
antly, when you type in a website address (i.e. 2600.com),
your browser will by default search for the index.html page
at that domain. And since we're using text files, you'll
just get a 404 message if you type in http://freepage.com/me

To solve this, just get yourself a new domain name, and
redirect everything from there to your index.txt page at
the free webhost. From that point onward, you can just give
your new domain name to people, and your page will launch
from the index.txt page.

But what if you don't want to pay for a .com address???
Worry not, there are actually a few domains out there
that will let you register a domain name of your choice
for free. For example, my page can be reached at
http://AxionTel.tk ...To register a .tk domain for free,
just go to http://dot.tk and fill out the required fields.

Note: If it turns out that the redirect doesn't work for
you, your webhost is probably a nazi & won't allow you to
hotlink to text files. Don't worry - there are oodles of
webspace providers out there that will let you hotlink
to .txt files; as of the date this article was written,
Geocities was just fine with it.


Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~
I don't think this would technically violate the Terms
of Service at your webspace provider, since none of
these providers would have thought of these exploits
yet. But just to be on the safe side, you might want
to create a fake index.html page just so that your
account doesn't get flagged. Aside from that, you should
be able to have an ad-free hotlink-able webpage for
months or years to come. Enjoy!

VIII.Closing


I. Background
First of all, a little background on Wardriving. Wardriving is an offshoot 
of wardialing. Wardialing is setting up a modem to dial a block of numbers 
in an attempt to find something to connect to. In the same way, wardriving 
is using a wireless network card in an attempt to find a wireless network 
to connect to. In this analogy, Kismet fills the role of the wardialer. It 
is the tool used to look for available networks.

According to the Kismet website, "Kismet is a 802.11b wireless network 
sniffer - it is different from a normal network sniffer (such as Ethereal 
or tcpdump) because it separates and identifies different wireless 
networks in the area. Kismet works with any wireless card which is capable 
of reporting raw packets (rfmon support), which include any prism2 based 
card (Linksys, D-Link, Rangelan, etc), Cisco Aironet cards, and Orinoco 
based cards."

According to the Airsnort website, "AirSnort is a wireless LAN (WLAN) tool 
which recovers encryption keys. AirSnort operates by passively monitoring 
transmissions, computing the encryption key when enough packets have been 
gathered."  WEP, the encryption protocol for 802.11b networks, was 
designed to protect the content of the transmissions from eavesdroppers. 
The problem is, the manner in which it was implemented is flawed and 
therefore vulnerable to attack. More information on this particular topic 
is readily available by searching Google for "Weaknesses in the Key 
Scheduling Algorithm of RC4".

For this article, I will be using an orinoco gold card which supports 
128-bit WEP and a Toshiba Satellite 1115-S103 laptop. This laptop has an 
oz6933 cardbus controller and is running Slackware Linux with a 2.4.20 
kernel.


II. Requirements
To get everything working the following list of software (documentation?) 
is necessary. I have attempted to divide it up by tool, but there is some 
crossover in the requirements. For example, both utilities require the 
patched drivers. Later in this article I will use the actual locations of 
the packages rather than just their websites.

Prerequisites:

1. the latest version of libpcap from http://www.tcpdump.org

For Kismet:

1. the latest Kismet package found at http://www.kismetwireless.net
2. the Orinoco driver patches available at http://airsnort.shmoo.com/orinocoinfo.html
3. the Linux kernel source available at http://www.kernel.org
4. the latest version of libpcap from http://www.tcpdump.org
5. the latest pcmcia-cs package available at 
http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net
6. the latest wireless tools package available at http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html

For Airsnort:
1. the latest Airsnort package found at http://airsnort.shmoo.com
2. gtk+ v.1.2

NOTE: wireless extensions (CONFIG_NET_RADIO) must be compiled into your 
kernel. Most likely it is already installed in the kernel by default. How 
to compile a kernel is outside the scope of this article but documentation 
is widely available on how to do this if necessary. Also, you may want to 
check that kernel pcmcia/cardbus support is not included, as you will be 
using the standalone pcmcia-cs package. I have heard and read conflicting 
reports about this. On my slackware system though, kernel pcmcia/cardbus 
support is turned off and this was verified by a friend of mine on his 
slack system.


III. libpcap

We'll install libpcap before we do anything else. This is a packet capture 
library which is useful for both of the tools we're going to setup.

        Get the latest version of libpcap from www.tcpdump.org and install 
it

        aphrax@josie:~$ tar -zxf libpcap-current.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ cd <libpcapdirectory> (depends on the build date)
        aphrax@josie:~$ ./configure
        aphrax@josie:~$ make
        aphrax@josie:# make install (NOTE: as root)


IV. Patched Drivers

The first step, is get the wireless network card drivers patched and 
installed. Download and untar the latest version of pcmcia-cs then enter 
that directory

        aphrax@josie:~$ wget http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/pcmcia-cs-3.2.3.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ tar -zxf pcmcia-cs-3.2.3.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ cd pcmcia-cs-3.2.3

Next, we'll grab the patch so we can put our wireless card into monitor 
mode

        aphrax@josie:~$ wget 
http://airsnort.shmoo.com/pcmcia-cs-3.2.1-orinoco-patch.diff

We will then apply the patch to our pcmcia-cs directory

        aphrax@josie:~$ patch -p1 < pcmcia-cs-3.2.1-orinoco-patch.diff

This command should produce results like the following

        patching file wireless/hermes.c 
        patching file wireless/hermes.h 
        patching file wireless/orinoco.c 
        patching file wireless/orinoco.h

NOTE: try -p0 instead of -p1 if it doesn't work. Mine was successful with 
the -p1 switch.

Next, is to compile and install pcmcia-cs and then reboot.

        aphrax@josie:~$ ./Configure (will give you options, the defaults 
should work just fine)
        aphrax@josie:~$ make all
        aphrax@josie:~$ make install
        aphrax@josie:~$ cd wireless
        aphrax@josie:~$ make all        (patched drivers are compiled here)
        aphrax@josie:# make install (NOTE: as root)

Now, reboot. If all goes well, you should now have your wireless card 
drivers installed correctly and ready to be used. To verify, we will 
install the Wireless Tools package which we will use to verify everything 
is setup correctly.


V. Wireless Tools

        Move back out to your home directory, or wherever it is your 
keeping your source files.

        aphrax@josie:~$ wget http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/contrib/wireless_tools.25.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ tar -zxf wireless_tools.25.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ cd wireless_tools.25
        aphrax@josie:~$ make
        aphrax@josie:# make install (NOTE: as root)

This will install the wireless tools that we need to verify our drivers 
are correct. If it's correct, "monitor" will be the last option in the 
list. run the following as root to check.

        aphrax@josie:~# iwpriv eth1

        eth1    Available private ioctl :
        force_reset             (8BE0) : set    0       & get   0
        card_reset              (8BE0) : set    0       & get   0       
        set_port3               (8BE0) : set    1 int   & get   0
        get_port3               (8BE0) : set    0       & get   1 int
        set_preamble            (8BE0) : set    1 int   & get   0
        get_preamble            (8BE0) : set    0       & get   1 int
        set_ibssport            (8BE0) : set    1 int   & get   0
        get_ibssport            (8BE0) : set    0       & get   1 int
        monitor                 (8BE0) : set    2 int   & get   0

VI. Kismet

Grab the latest version of kismet from 
www.kismetwireless.net/downloads.shtml
I will assume for the rest of this example that the latest development 
version was selected as this is what I used.

        aphrax@josie:~$ tar -zxf kismet-devel.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ cd kismet-devel
        aphrax@josie:~$ ./configure
        aphrax@josie:~$ make dep
        aphrax@josie:~$ make all
        aphrax@josie:# make install (NOTE: as root)

After building Kismet, it's configuration files must be edited so that it 
can actually be used. The following commands must be run as root

        aphrax@josie:# cd /usr/local/etc
        aphrax@josie:# pico kismet.conf (or vi, or emacs, or whatever your 
favorite editor happens to be)

You will want to change the "suiduser" option to be the username on the 
system that will be using Kismet. This allows Kismet to drop it's root 
permissions when the hopper is run to a normal user account. Mine looks 
like this

        suiduser=aphrax

You will also want to change the source option. Mine looks like this.

        source=orinoco,eth1,orinoco

        - the first 'orinoco' tells Kismet what drivers to use.
        - eth1 (or whatever your wireless device is) tells Kismet what 
device to look for
        - the second 'orinoco' is the name Kismet uses for this particular 
source device.

That should be enough to get Kismet up and running. There are many other 
options listed in the kismet.conf and kismet_ui.conf which are fairly well 
documented in the files themselves. Options to configure gpsdrive, 
ethereal and other Kismet options such as sounds, colors and logging.


VII. Airsnort

We will now install Airsnort. Since Airsnort is a gui application 
(requiring gtk+) it must be run from an X window. If you don't have X 
installed on your computer, you can skip this section. Otherwise, we can 
go ahead and install it. Download the latest version of Airsnort from 
http://airsnort.shmoo.com

        aphrax@josie:~$ tar -zxf Airsnort-0.2.1b.tar.gz
        aphrax@josie:~$ cd Airsnort-0.2.1b
        aphrax@josie:~$ ./autogen.sh
        aphrax@josie:~$ make

The actual binary is located in the Airsnort-0.2.1b/src directory and is 
called 'airsnort'. You can run it from there or copy it to wherever you'd 
like.


VIII. Closing

You should now have a laptop that is configured to find Access Points 
whether or not they are using WEP. It should also be able to break the WEP 
encryption if that's what you want to do. Of course, it will take a huge 
amount of packets but it is possible. If you are still having trouble, 
there is a myriad of documentation to be found on the internet. Most 
problems can be solved by going to the website for that particular package 
and reading their forums or FAQ. The websites listed in the requirements 
section should be able to help you work through any issues you might have.

Linux Security for the Novice User

By: netmad


Introduction:
In this text file I'm going to explain why and how you should secure you Linux box.  
If you think that Linux is secure enough from a fresh install to keep intruders at
bay then your slightly misguided.  Linux is actually one of the most insecure operating 
systems you can install.  It takes some good work and effort to actually make your system 
secure.


Patches and Updates:

        One of the most important parts of securing and maintaining a secure linux box is 
downloading and installing the updates and patches from your software vendor.
Patches and updated become available on a weekly basis for the most part.  Failing install 
patches and upgrades is just irresponsible.  

SUID/SGID Files and Programs

        An attacker could attack files containing SUID/SGID bits in an attempt to gain root 
on your box.  The easiest way to prevent this from happening limit what programs are running 
with SUID/SGID perms.  Simple steps to remember.  Few programs actually require SUID perms.  
For those that do, make sure that they are not writeable.  The SUID programs that do not 
need a SUID bit, simply change their permissions with chmod -s.
SUID programs that you do not need or do not use simply uninstall them. 
Now you're probably wondering "how do I find these so called SUID/SGID files and programs?"  
Well I'm going to tell you. Keep in mind that there are multiple variations for each command.  
I will show you a couple.

To find all SUID programs/files you issue the following command at your prompt.

find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls

or

find / -type f -perm -4000

To determine what files should run with a SUID bit I suggest that you look at the man 
page for each individual program/file.

For example, if you want to know if ping should run with a SUID bit issue this command 
at the prompt.

man ping

This will bring up the manual page for the command ping




You should use the same principle for determining whether or not a program/file should run with SGID perms.  
The command to find these files is as follows.

find / -type f -perm -02000 -ls

or

find / -type f -perm -2000

This will print you out a complete list of those files.

Now I'm going to explain how you can print you a viewable list of these SUID/SGID files 
to your home dir.  For example, let's say that your home dir is /home/bob you would issue 
the following command to print the SUID files in your home dir in a text file called 
SUID.txt

find / -type f -perm -4000 </home/bob/SUID.txt

You can do the same for SGID files

find / -type f -perm -2000 </home/bob/SGID.txt

Now lets talk about how we would remove the SUID/SGID bits from these programs.  
In this example I will list a couple of the more well known programs and files 
that are a security issue.  For example, convfont which can be found in 
/usr/bin/convfont is a known weakness is some versions of RedHat Linux. 
To remove the SUID bit from this program you should issue the following command.

chmod -s /usr/bin/convfont

Another example of a file that can provide root access via SUID shell scripts is suidexec.  
This was discovered in earlier versions of Debian.  When you do your find  / -type f -perm -4000 
it will tell you what directory these files are in.  I will use /dir/dir for this example.
So to get rid of the SUID bit you would 

chmod -s /dir/dir/suidexec 
 
There are two examples of different files and the method to remove the SUID bit is the same.  
Now, lets say that you remove a SUID bit from a program that did not need it to be removed or 
you did one on accident.  You would simply give it back its SUID bit.

chmod +s /dir/dir/file

This entire process is the same for removing and restoring the SGID bits also.
Once you remove a SUID bit from a program I suggest that you test each file after you have done so.  
This will help insure that you have not removed a SUD/SGID bit from a program/file that requires it.

I will also take a moment and show you have to find all world writeable files.
The command is simple.
find / -perm -2 -type f -print
 Page 2
Summary of SUID/SGID/WW Commands
Finding SUID files is
find / -type f -perm -4000
Finding SGID files is
find / -type f -perm -2000
Finding World Writeables is
find / -perm -2 -type f -print
To take a SUID/SGID bit away
chmod -s /dir/dir/file
To give a SUID/SGID bit back
chmod +s /dir/dir/file

Programs in INETD
        Most versions of Linux will have a configuration file located in /etc/inetd.conf
This file regulates what services are started each time you boot your system.  This is also one 
of the first things you should check.  Use your editor (vi, joe, pico, ee) whatever one you use 
and look at this file.  Comment out any service that you do not wish to use.  For example, if you 
do not wish other to have telnet access to your box you are going to add a pound symbol (#) 
in front of the command string which starts this service.  I HIGHLY recommend that you do this 
for everything that you do not wish to run.  Also, If you do not know what it is..... disable it! 

Examples of services that you may wish to disable are as follows

* File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
* finger
* Network File System (NFS)
* RPC services
* Server Message Block Protocol (SMB)
* R services
* sunrpc    

The list goes on.  Determine what you want and what you don't want and comment out the unnecessary ones.

File Transfer Protocol
        FTP is one of the most commonly used protocols.  One thing to keep in mind when installing 
Linux or setting up Linux afterwards is to NOT allow anonymous FTP access. There are many bad things 
that can happen when allowing public access to your FTP server.
For example, it is possible to use FTP to bypass your system firewall.  This is not something that 
I would like to happen to me.  Would you?  I didn't think so.
FTP does have some default security features.  Of course you're going to have to edit these files.  

These three files are as follows

/etc/ftpusers
/etc/ftphosts
/etc/ftpaccess

This is where you can define your allow or deny users/hosts.
You do however want to make sure that you deny users the following commands.
chmod, rename, delete, or overwrite.  These are commands that are not essential for ftp users to have.
 
Telnet
        What can I really say here?  I'm not an advocate for Telnet, so I will keep this section short 
and sweet.  The key word in the paragraph is SSH!  I HIGHLY suggest that you install is and use it for 
a substitute to telnet.  It is by far the most secure way of allowing others to connect remotely to 
your system.

Network Auditing

        I suggest that you download and use some sort of network auditing software to test your systems 
security.  There are a couple here I would like to mention.  All of which can be found on the World Wide Web. 

* Nmap -(Network Mapper www.insecure.org/nmap)  Scans for all open ports and OS prints
* Nessus -(www.nessus.org) Scans for known vulnerabilities (My personal favorite)
* Satan - Scans for known vulnerabilities
* Saint - A Satan like program that scans for known vulnerabilities

LILO (lilo.conf)
        If you want to enhance your physical security better it is possible to set a LILO Password.  
This will prevent users from booting to your linux system with out putting in the proper password.  
This is done via the lilo.conf file located in the dir of /etc.  To do this you simply use your 
preferred editor.  In this example I will use pico.  As root at your command prompt type

pico /etc/lilo.conf

This will open up a the lilo.conf file for editing.  You will see a file similar to the following

#lilo.conf
boot = /dev/hda
install = /boot/boot.b
message = /boot/message
prompt

image = /vmlinuz
     label = linux
     root  = /dev/hda2
     read-only
#eof



Now, what we want to do is add a password so that your computer can not boot with out first supplying it.
We would add the following string
password = pass
For example purpose I will use the password 8b3Tg15nOb
So the string would read as so
password = 8b3Tg15nOb

You should add this string in the last line just before the image string.
So my entire lilo.conf file would look like this
#lilo.conf
boot = /dev/had
install = /boot/boot.b
message = /boot/message
prompt
password = 8bTg15nOb

image = /vmlinuz
   label = linux
   root = /dev/hda2
   read-only
#eof

Permissions
I am going to list the numeric permissions for you.  Using the numerics is actually better 
then using chmod +rwx commands 

* r = read
* w = write
* x = execute
* 0 = No permissions
* 1 = Execute
* 2 = Write
* 3 = Write and execute
* 4 = Read
* 5 = Read and execute
* 6 = Read and write
* 7 = Full Perms - Read, write and execute
When using the perms you have to make sure that you do them in the proper order.
777 = Owner can rwx Group can rwx World can rwx
So if I wanted to set permissions to my home dir /home/netmad defining that only I could rwx to my dir I would 
chmod 700 /home/netmad
This will also keep my directory hidden from prying eyes.                                        Page 5

Directory Security

        It's always a good idea to make sure that each individual account on your box has the c
orrect permissions set.  Some default installs of Linux come with 755 perms or even 777 perms.  
This means that anyone with an account on this particular server will be able to access your 
home dir one way or another.
One of the first things I suggest you do, considering your not running an services from your 
home directory is to chmod 700 /home/yourdir ie, chmod 700 /home/netmad
Another good way to hide your entire directory from someone is as simple as adding a (.) period 
in front on your home dir.  So for example, If I wanted to hide my home dir /home/netmad I would 
rename my directory /home/.netmad


You can do this for any directory on your server.  I would suggest doing this as soon as your 
add each user.  When it askes you for the directory you would like to add for this person...
just put the period before their dir name.
To take this one step further if you actually want to hide an entire directory you can put it 
in a hidden dir using (" ") parentheses.  So what I would do if I wanted to hide a particular 
dir and all the files in it I would first have to make the hidden dir.
mkdir " "    then I would change dir's to the dir
chdir " "
And from here I can store my files and keep them hidden from the inexperienced eyes.

Mail Security
        On of the most well known exploitable mail services in Sendmail.  The easiest way to prevent 
yourself from becoming a victim of a Sendmail exploit is to uninstall it.  I would personally install 
Qmail or fetchmail.  There are multiple other Mail service programs out there that are more secure 
then Sendmail. 
You have to realize that sendmail is one of the main targets for hacking.  It's a publically available 
service and if it's running, anyone can use it.  Sendmail usually always runs as root and it is very 
difficult in most cases to configure.
If you insist on using sendmail I would suggest getting the book "The Sendmail Nutshell" by O'Reilly.
If you decide to go with Qmail you can find a complete HOWTO at
http://www.flounder.net/qmail/qmail.howto.html


This is the conclusion of the first edition of my security related text files for the Novice user.  
Next issue will include Web Server Security, auditing logs, other Security tools and firewalls.  
I will also go more in depth explanation of the ways to actually secure protocols such as ftp and 
telnet for example.
If you have any comments, questions, concerns, or anything that you would like to see added to my 
next edition please email me at networkmadness@somtesc.org

PLEASE NOTE THE ARTICLE THAT APEARED IN 2600 MAGAZINE(20:1, spring 2003) 
has some clerical errors that have been corrected 
in this text!

This article will explain many methods of caller ID and ANI spoofing that 
can still be used as of today.  I have also 
included a brief FAQ for those of you who may not be familiar with the 
terminology and should help you understand this
article more.  I hope that this article will make many of you aware that 
Caller ID and ANI, though often can be used as 
great tools, can also be a waste of your time and money.  Please don't 
confuse this article with past's articles I've wrote, 
though this article does mention techniques I have used in the past it 
does include up to date accurate information and is 
meant to be a reference article on how caller ID and ANI can be spoofed 
and has been spoofed in the past so that all of 
those telco techs out there that claim it can't be done have definite 
proof that it has been.  You will also find some 
useful links at the end of this article, enjoy.

First some FAQs

So, just what is ANI?

ANI stands for Automatic Number Identification.  ANI is a service feature 
that transmits a directory number
or Billing Telephone Number(BTN) to be obtained automatically.  In other 
words your number is sent directly
to wherever you are calling to automatically.  Unlike Caller ID you can 
not block this feature from 
happening.

What is flex ANI?

Flexible ANI provides  "II"(identification indicator) digits that identify 
the class of service of the
phone you are calling from.  Flex ANI is transmitted as II digits + 
directory number.

What is the directory number, or 'DN'?
This is the number the switch associates with your line for services like 
caller ID, call return, etc.. it is the number 
that is displayed on caller ID or flex ANI when you call someone, but it 
is not your billing number, and sometimes not even 
the number where you receive phone calls!

What are ANI "II" digits?
Identification Indicator digits describe the class of service of the 
telephone.
Some examples are:

00 "POTS"(plain old telephone service) or home phone
07 Restricted line
27 ACTS payphone
29 Prison phones
62 Cellular phones
70 Cocot Payphone

What is an ANAC?

ANAC stands for Automatic Number Anouncement Circuit.  This is a phone 
number you can call that will
ring into a circuit that anounces the ANI number you are calling from.  An 
example of an ANAC is 800-555-1140 and 
800-555-1180.
When you call this number you will get an ARU(Audio Response Unit) this is 
the circuit that anounces your ANI.
When you call 800-555-1140 or 800-555-1180 the ARU will give you this 
information:
"The ARU ID is [id], Your line number is [trunk number], the DNIS is [DNIS 
number] the ANI is [II digits followed by ANI]"

ARU ID: Audio Response Unit ID number, this identifies which ARU in a 
group of ARUs you reached.
Line number: The trunk you came in on.
DNIS: Dialed Number Identification Service -- Tells you which number YOU 
called.(i.e. 800-555-1140 is 03123, 800-555-1180 is
03125)
ANI: II digits followed by ANI.

What is a BTN(Billing telephone number)?

BTN is a phone number for which charges are to be billed to.  It is not 
necessarily the phone number of the line you are 
calling from.  

What is Psuedo ANI?
 
Psuedo ANI or PANI is a unique non-dialable number used to route cellular 
calls. PANI is used by 911 operators to find
the cell site and sector from which the cellphone is calling.

What is an ANI fail?

An ANI fail is when no ANI is sent. Usually the areacode of the tandem 
office completing the call will be sent.(i.e. if
the tandem office is in 213 the ANI will be sent as II digits+213.)

How do ANI fails occur?

ANI fails can occur when the tandem office completing a call didn't 
receive ANI from the central office originating the call.
ANI fails can also be caused when ANI is intentionally not sent, this can 
happen by using a method called op diverting.
Another way you can cause ANI fails is through the use of the AT&T long 
distance network.  Simply dial 10-10-288-0 or dial
0 and ask your operator for AT&T.  When AT&T comes on the line simply 
touch tone in a toll free number and the call
will be completed with no ANI.  Note however that this method is dependent 
on the AT&T center you reach, some AT&T centers
still forward ANI, others send an AT&T BTN as ANI, but most AT&T centers 
currently don't forward ANI.

What is op diverting?

Op diverting is a term that describes the process of intentionally causing 
an ANI fail by having your local operator dial the
number you wish to reach.  Most operator centers are not equipped to 
forward ANI and so they complete the call with no ANI.

What's the difference between ANI and Caller ID?

ANI is the BTN associated with the telephone and is the direct number from 
where you are calling from.  Caller ID is usually
the BTN but occasionally can be incorrect, i.e. the main number of a 
business instead of the actual number being called from.
Another difference in ANI is that it shows the class of service of the 
phone number while Caller ID just shows the name and
number.


Now that you have an idea of what ANI is and how it differs from Caller ID 
I will explain some methods for spoofing both of
them. 

Spoofing Caller ID

Method #1 Using a PRI line.
Major companies that have a PBX with many hundreds of lines hooked up to a 
Primary Rate ISDN(PRI) line can spoof caller id
by setting the caller ID number to whatever number you want for a given 
extension on that PBX by typing a simple command on
the PBX's terminal.

NOTE: In my 2600 article I was talking about how this method also spoofs 
ANI, I'm actually wrong about this, it spoofs Flex 
ANI, not ANI! hah maybe I should read my own FAQs! Anyways, flex ANI is 
the Directory Number on the switch, it is not the 
BTN! The real ANI is the BTN.  Most 800 numbrs use Flex ANI, not real ANI, 
so I thought ANI was being spoofed but in 
actuality it was only the caller ID and flex ANI being spoofed.

Method #2 Orangeboxing
Orangeboxing is Caller ID signal emulation through the use of a bell 202 
modem, sound card software, or a recording of
a Caller ID transmission.  Orangeboxing is not very effective because you 
have to send the signal AFTER the caller has
answered their phone.  However through the magic of social engineering you 
could have one friend call a number and pretend
he has reached a wrong number while sending a Callwaiting Caller ID signal 
fooling the victim into believing he is receiving
another incoming call from the name and number spoofed and when the victim 
"flashes over" have your friend hand you the 
phone nand continue with your social engineer.

Method #3 Calling Cards
I learned this method from some phone phreaks on a party line a long time 
ago.  I can't recall the name of the calling card
company but all one had to do was provide a credit card as a method of 
payment to obtain a pin number.  Once you had the pin
number you just op divert or cause an ANI fail to the 800 number for the 
calling card and it would ask you to please enter
the number you are calling from, you touch tone in ANY number you want, 
then it would ask for your pin number and then what
number you wanted to call.  The person you called would see the number you 
touched tone in as the caller ID for that call, 
if the number was in the same area as the caller it would also show the 
name associated with the phone number.

Spoofing ANI

Spoofing ANI is a little more difficult than spoofing Caller ID unless you 
have access to a central office switch.

A few years ago when Verizon was still GTE here in California, the local 
verizon '0' operator center was located locally
to me and they did have the ability to send ANI without ANI fails.  
However I found a test number on a DMS-100 Switch
in Ontario that would give me a local '0' operator only she'd see an ANI 
fail and have to ask me for what number I was
calling from, any number I gave her would be used as ANI for any call I 
had her place.  A while ago AT&T used to send
ANI when you placed calls to toll free numbers through the AT&T network 
and you could only call 800 numbers that were 
hosted by AT&T, after publishing an article about how to spoof ANI by op 
diverting to 800-call-att AT&T had their
networked changed within a month of publication.  Their new network 
however just made it easier to cause ANI fails
to toll free numbers.  On the new network you could call any toll free 
number, not just AT&T hosted numbers, and their would
be no ANI on the call, unless you were calling 800-call-att or a few other 
numbers that are internal numbers hosted by the
call center it's self.  All you have to do to cause ANI fails to toll free 
numbers now is dial 10-10-288-0 and touch tone
the 800 number in when AT&T comes on the line.  This method of causing ANI 
fails is great because you don't have to speak
to a live operator and you can even have your modem wardial 800 numbers 
without fear of your ANI being logged.

However there are some AT&T call centers that still forward ANI, and you 
may be able to reach
them even if the call centers aren't in your area, try op diverting to an 
AT&T language assistance operator since it
is not likely that your call center will have a Tagalog speaking operator 
so you will get routed to a different AT&T
center that does, possibly an AT&T center that still forwards ANI.  If you 
get an AT&T center that still forwards ANI
you can spoof ANI by simply giving the operator the number you want to 
spoof as where you are calling from and social 
engineering her into placing a call to the toll free number you wish to 
call. Here are some AT&T language assistance
numbers:


1 800 833-1288 Cantonese
1 800 233-7003 Hindi
1 800 233-8006 Japanese
1 800 233-8923 Korean
1 800 233-1823 Mandarin
1 800 233-8622 Polish
1 800 233-2394 Russian
1 800 233-9008 Spanish
1 800 233-9118 Tagalog
1 800 233-1388 Vietnamese
 

 The best method for spoofing ANI and Caller ID is social engineering a 
Telus operator to do it for you.
I stumbled upon this method when I was testing out a theory.  In my 
previous 2600 article about spoofing ANI through AT&T I 
mentioned something known as the 710 trick.  This was a method of making 
collect calls that the called party wouldn't be 
billed for.  The way the 710 trick worked in the past was you'd op divert 
to 800-call-att and give the operator a 710 number
as where you are calling from and have her place a collect call to the 
number you want to call.  The called party would never
get a bill because 710 is a non-existant area code.  AT&T does it's 
billing rates by where the call is being placed from and
to and because you used a 710 number there were undetermined rates.  I was 
testing to see if the 710 trick also worked with
a canadian phone company called Telus.  After testing it out my friend in 
canada dialed *69 and it read back the 710 number
I gave the operator, this is how I discovered Caller ID spoofing was 
possible through Telus and I began to come up with a
social engineer to get them to place a call for me without selecting a 
billing method.  I now know that it is also possible
to spoof ANI through Telus.

 Telus' toll-free "dial-around" is 800-646-0000, by simply calling this 
number with an ANI-fail you can give the operator 
any number as where you are calling from.  As of January 2003, Telus can 
now place calls to many toll free numbers and the 
ANI will show up as whatever number you say you're calling from. So by 
simply causing an ANI-fail to Telus dial-around 
service you can spoof Caller ID AND ANI to anyone you want to call, not 
only that if the person you are calling is in the 
same area as the number you are spoofing, the NAME and number shows up on 
the caller ID display. To cause an ANI fail to 
Telus all you have to do is op-divert to 800-646-0000 or dial 10-10-288-0 
and touch tone 800-646-0000 when AT&T comes on the 
line.

 You can social engineer the Telus operator to place "test calls" for you 
which is a free call with no billing, you simply 
tell the Telus operator at the beginning of the call that you are a "Telus 
technician" calling from [number to spoof] and 
need her to place a "Test call" to [number to call].  

The social engineer pretext looks like this:
You pick up the phone, at dialtone 10102880
AT&T Automated Operator: "AT&T, to place a call"
Touch tone 800-646-0000
AT&T Automated Operator: "Thank you for using AT&T"
<RING>
Telus: This is the Telus operator, Lisa speaking. (or, This is the telus 
operator, what number are you calling from?)
You: Hi Lisa, This is the Telus technician, you should see an ANI failure 
on your screen, I'm calling from [number to spoof]
I need you to place a test call to [number to call]
Telus: Thank you from Telus

  What just happened was AT&T sent an ANI fail to Telus, you told the 
operator to key in your new number calling from, Telus
then places the call and uses the number you gave as both ANI and CALLER 
ID! NOTE about spoofing ANI to Toll freee numbers: 
Not all US toll free numbers are accessable from Canadian trunks, so even 
though you are spoofing a US number the call will 
not be able to be routed through Telus.

  Of course, the social engineer will probably become ineffective soon, 
though I've demonstrated it at H2K2 in July 2002
and It's now 2003 and is still working.  The spoofed caller ID also shows 
up on collect calls(though I think you can only 
call people in Canada collect with this service), third party billing 
(would you accept a third party bill call if the 
caller ID said your girlfriends number and the op said she was the one 
placing the call? :)), and calling card calls, so you 
could even legitamatily spoof Caller ID if you had a Telus calling card, 
however the rates are pretty expensive, though you 
can get one if you have Telus as your local phone company or if you live 
outside Canada you can pay with a credit card
(you need a Canada billing address though!), call 1-800-308-2222 to order 
one.

 The sad thing is that ANI spoofing and Caller ID spoofing is so easy, yet 
many companies use ANI and Caller ID as a 
security feature -- Kevin Mitnick even stated in his book "Art of 
Deception" that Caller ID was easy to spoof with ISDN PRI 
lines but that you can't spoof ANI(even though on some certain switches it 
will spoof ANI.) here you can spoof Caller ID and
ANI using a simple social engineer that is very effective.  T-mobile 
allows you to check your voicemail without entering your
password if the Caller ID shows your cellphone number, credit Card 
companies allow you to activate credit cards simply by 
calling their toll free number with the ANI of the "home phone" number you 
put on their application, Some calling card 
companies allow you to access your calling card by simply calling from 
'your number', some utility companies including the 
phone company allow you to set up online billing using only a call to one 
of their toll free numbers that use ANI to verify 
that you are calling from the phone number listed on the account and 
activate your online billing with no further 
verification.  ANI and Caller ID can be nice tools for verification, but 
you should also verify other identifying 
information such as a social security number or pin before letting just 
anyone calling from a certain number access your 
services.
