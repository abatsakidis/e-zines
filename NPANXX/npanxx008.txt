        Whats up all you slack eyed, half crazed, a little insane, techno wanna
be 
intelligent freaks! Here is a brand new issue of NPANXX! Don't worry, we know y
ou 
fear it and love us. We know.  Here is some information that'll make you fall o
ver 
in your chair, smack your mom, and load a huge bowl just to get a glimpse of wh
at 
the hell we are talking about.

We've packed this issue with a little bit of everything from each of our minds.
 
(Pretty scary huh?) We are some crazy mofos. Anyway, we've had some troubles 
lately with our site, and getting things rolling, but now we got it all under 
control. We got up off of our lazy, slacking, no good for shiz asses and put 
something together that duck tape can't even keep together, so watch out!

TeamPhreak is back, slicing, dicing, and doing everything that Chef Boyardee 
can't to give you the information that you only dream about in your wettest 
dreams, so wait no longer, scroll right down and read! read! READ!

It's Christmas time

And TP's on the prowl

Even Parenomen, Yes, 

He's hit puberty now!

Bor is at home

Supplying the speed

Giving us the network

We so badly need

Where oh where

Is that damned stain

If something goes wrong

He's the one we blame

But all is well

And we're still here

Supplying you all

With TP's Christmas cheer

So forget your presents

Forget all of that

It's a new issue 

So chill and relax

While we feed your mind

With information thats new

Introduction:
-------------

        It seems that as time goes on, and people get more politically

correct, this country of ours is turning into one giant pre-school. 

No longer are people allowed to be ignorant or stupid.  In this day 

and age, killing someone because of their race carries a larger 

penalty than simply killing someone for any other reason. Shouldn't the

act carry the same harsh penalty no matter what your motive was? In 

today's america, people get scared, and they call for security, but do

we allow ourselves to do anything that would be considered anti 

politically correct? No. When american's get scared, we simply tell the 

government to fix it, but don't go out of your way to keep our rights...

who needs them? In today's america, people have forgotten what this 

county was founded on. No one remembers that our personal freedoms are 

what made us different from many countries in the world.

        Today in america, if someone doesn't like what someone said to

them, they can pass a law.  If someone doesn't like the fact that 

someone is smoking in a restaurant, pass a law. If someone thinks that 

we need to be safe...Watch everyone. That's the way it seems to work now. 

If someone wants something done, then pass a law. Restrict us even more.

Take away more and more rights. Lets make more laws, and take away more

rights.


Lassen Sie mich Ihre Papiere sehen.
-----------------------------------

        In over a year, we have gone from being secure with no strong 

visible problems, to a country that wants to build a central database 

which would include every website that you visit, every time you fill 

your car with gas, every credit card transaction, among other things 

which they probably don't want us to know.


Under the spreading chestnut tree...I sold you, you sold me.
------------------------------------------------------------

        Today america is still a country with great freedoms. 

Compared to many other countries in the world, we have more freedom,

live better, and pay far less taxes. However with upcoming terrorist 

attacks more likely than ever, how much will people panic? When 

people got scared after September 11th, we allowed the government to

pass law's with access to our personal lives like never before. 

No longer does the FBI need a court order to tap your phone line or 

watch your email. No longer will someone exploring a computer system 

be free from un-needed persecution. No longer do we have the rights 

that we had before.

        And what about after the next attack? What happens after we 

get attacked one more...or even two more times? Will there be 

marshall law? Will the military have to take over the streets after

the scared and ignorant riot? Will the government be forced by the 

will of the ignorant to force people to "show us their papers?" 

How long before america gets more and more like nazi germany?

        There's a simple solution to all of this rather than taking

away our personal rights to live and breathe like normal. If we would

simply close the borders to this country, our rights could be protected

without reprocussions. Would this totally rule out terrorist attacks 

by citizens of the United States?  No, but nothing that we're doing now 

makes sense as it is. While we check ever third person in line at the 

airport, the terrorist who can count gets right through the line. While 

we patrol the skies, who is patrolling the borders?


Stability, insisted the Controller, stability. The primal and 

 the ultimate need.  Stability.  Hence all this.
-----------------------------------------------------------------


        No need to walk to another restaurant today. The whiners of

America have forced the entrapaneur to force away business from his

own establishment. More and more states are passing laws which FORCE

business owners to conform to the requests of a few people. No longer

can a restaurant owner simply put a non-smoking section in their 

restaurant, no smoking is allowed at all. The amendments all say the

same thing. They all insist that it is for the health of the public. 

Everyone insists that it's for our own good. Why are we not allowed 

to choose what is for our own good? Why can't the business owner 

decide who's business he wants to turn away? In today's america, 

if we can't please everyone, we must please the people who are 

"trying to protect us."

        Why can't the non-smokers simply decide to go to another 

restaurant that doesn't allow smoking? There are hundreds of 

restaurant in every major city. I'm not a smoker myself, however 

even though I'm not, I believe that if I don't want to smell 

cigarette smoke, and someone has decided to allow it in their 

establishment, it should be up to me to go somewhere else. 

Why punish the business owner for having such a policy?


Conclusion:
-----------

        Today, America is much too hesitant to keep what this country was

founded upon. No longer is it okay to have personal rights. No longer is 

it acceptable to be stupid or ignorant...it is a crime in many cases. 

Today in America, we no longer have the right to choose who we want in 

our own businesses. Today in America, it's looking a lot more like Mexico,

rather than America. Will we ever gain our personal rights back? Maybe 

once the borders are closed it will be a start. While we are the only 

country left in the world who allows nearly anyone in, Australia and 

other countries with strict imigration policies have less crime, and 

do not need such drastic changes in their laws every couple years.

        Keep america like it was. Allow us to be stupid, idiotic, 

and ignorant. Allow us to choose who is allowed into our 

businesses. Allow American's to choose what's right and wrong 

for them within the limits of the law. But don't change the law 

to choose what's right and wrong for us.

Introduction:
-------------

        Have you ever heard of a 'burnout' or ghost phone? Well, I hadn't until
 

this summer. I was on a greyhound bus riding up to NYC to meet my crack connect
ion 

and this brother man next to me started talking about 'burnout' cell phones. 

Being the shady phone Phreak that I am, I pumped him for as much information as
 I 

could. Unfortunately, the fucker couldn't give me shit. Well, this information 
lay 

dormant in my head for several months. Until a klubie popped into #cellular and
 

asked, "what's a burnout number?" This individual, being a klubie, had no initi
ative 

to actually do some research.

        I'm telling you, phreaks best friends are his voice, for social enginee
ring, 

and http://www.google.com for looking before you ask. Remember there are no stu
pid 

questions, just stupid people. Anyway, my interest had been rekindled, so I use
d my 

second best friend and started searching. Two cellular message boards were my p
rimary 

and most valuable finds. I discovered that 'burnout' is street slang. Most phre
aks 

actually call them ghost phones, or ghost numbers. I also learned that any moro
n 

could do this with the proper instructions, like the ones contained in this fil
e.


Ghost Number: 
--------------

        So what is a ghost number anyway? For all intents and purposes, 

it's a number that you can use to make free phone calls with. Why they work 

is all theory. I've yet to meet anyone with actual knowledge on the matter. 

Following are some existing theories.

        One theory is that ghost numbers are actually cellular numbers from oth
er 

Areas (roamers) that pass certain tests on the cell tower/cell switch that your
 

currently on, such as matching up in a database of cellular npa-nxx's etc. 

This makes sense on one level because several ghost numbers have been tracked 

back to a cellular switches. Unfortunately I haven't been able to check a large
 

amount of ghost numbers. Test this theory yourself. This is interesting in the 

search for new ghost numbers, assuming this theory is correct. Another theory, 

a little weaker, is that the switch actually logs all the roaming calls made 

and then communicates them back to the "ghost" switch at a later time. With no 

real time authentication, the ghost slips by. 

        Now either of these theories could be complete bullshit or both could h
ave 

a basis in fact. Irregardless ghost numbers are most definitely a glitch in the
 

switching software. Whether it's the switch or the cell towers software is anyo
ne's 

guess at the moment. In order to test the location of software glitch, try movi
ng 

around with your ghost numbers. See if you can determine if its cell tower or s
witch 

dependent, remember you're probably going to have to change your SID if you cha
nge 

switches. Ghost numbers don't work everywhere, so I'm leaning towards a switch 
dependent 

glitch.


Finding a Ghost Number:
-----------------------

        To find a ghost number, locate an NPA near you but not your own. Progra
m a 

number with that NPA into your phone, starting with NXX 200. The last four digi
ts don't 

matter. So if your NPA was 202, you'd program 202-200-XXXX into your phone. If 
you can't 

call with that number try the next NXX, 202-201-XXXX keep going until you reach
 999. 

If there are no ghost numbers in that NPA, move onto another. I should remind y
ou that 

this does not work in all areas, and you may scan until your fingers turn black
, blue, 

and eventually bleed. Sorry about your luck.


Nokia 5165: 
----------- 

        The Nokia 5165, this is the phone I have, so this is the phone I will t
ell you 

how to ghost. If you don't have this type of phone, go fuck yourself... It all 
goes back 

to the introduction, its easy enough to find out how to ghost your Particulate 
phone. 

All you have to do is change the NAM and getting to that menu only requires you
 to input 

a simple code (for most phones, some need data cables... in which case, get a d
ifferent 

phone).
        The code for most nokias and the 5165 included is *#639# enter that int
o the phone 

and you'll be prompted with "Cellular Number:" Now, input your ghost number. Ne
xt, you'll 

then be prompted with "Enter Code:" this is the prompt for your SID enter one l
ocal to you. 

The phone will then reboot. Call your local FBI field office, if someone answer
s... SCORE! 

You have a ghost number.

Fax on demand is a system used by a lot of large corporations. 

Fax on demand only offers one feature witch is sending 

documents via fax machine. The cool part is that you can input 

any telephone number in North America and that's where it will

be sent. I also should add that it's untraceable so that means

you can attack whomever you want whenever you want and not have 

to worry about getting busted. 



When you dial into the fax on demand system 90 percent of the

time they will say something like this.....


'You have reached blank corporations fax on demand system' 



Pretty easy to indentify huh?  



The other 10 percent will have one option to transfer you to 

the fax on demand system.


They'll give you a few opinton's to choose from each company

have there's setup differently but here's any idea of how 

there setup.


Note: one system is actually setup this way  



1: To get index of documents sent to you 

- Enter the fax number followed by the # key

- Repeats number entered

- If the number is correct press 1

- To re-enter the number press 2 



2: To get documents sent to you 

- you may order up to 3-5 documents by entering your 

1st section now.... 



Depending on how large the company is and how many documents

they offer will effect how long the document numbers will be.

I've seen everything from 1 to 5 digits Long.  



9: To end the call  



Like I said earlier in this article each system is setup 

differently. Some have more features than others but 

none the less there pretty much the same.  



Another side note if for some reason when fax on demand calls

and the line is busy it will call the party 3 more times. Some

systems' will call 3 times with 15 min. intervals. Or the 

system will call 3 times within that 15 min's  



As an extra bonus I'll include some numbers for your 

phreak enjoyment!!!!

        Chances are you already know someone who is subscribed to the

MCI Worldcom Long Distance Calling Plan or may be a user yourself.   

Imagine if you will, recieving a rather large bill from MCI Worldcom 

with charges upon charges for calls you never made or know nothing   

about. How did this happen?  Believe it or not, it is happening all  

across the US and the methods used to rip someone off may not be as  

entirely difficult as you once thought. While exploring the MCI      

Worldcom service, these past couple of months, I've discovered things

MCI just might not want the average person to know. Things that are  

so obviously exploitable to almost anyone, but you may have never    

thought about. In this analysis I will discuss just how one person   

can go about charging calls to someone else with a little common 

sense, the use of a phone, and some social engineering skills.

        When signing up for an MCI account, most people aren't smart 

enough to read the fine print. Who reads fine print anyway?  You may 

be getting stuck with something you don't exactly want attached to 

your bill, but guess what? There's nothing you can do about it 

because no matter what, MCI slips this little handy dandy feature 

into your calling plan. A little pushy, huh? So what is this feature 

you may ask. A 1-800 Number directed to your home line or any other 

line you may choose to use when signing up with MCI Worldcom.  

If you go to the MCI website (www.worldcom.com) and check out their 

calling plans you'll notice that the whole bit about the 800 number 

is on a completely different page and not mentioned in the calling 

plan. Kinda misleading, huh? If you sign up via the web, after you 

are confirmed, about a week later you'll recieve an email stating 

that your 800 is now active. WTF? 800 Number? Ehm, ok.  So what's 

the big deal about this 800 number anyways?  More on that later,

because that's the very key to MCI's big security flaw.  

        When signing up for MCI service you are asked the basic questions, 

name, address, etc. No big deal. After all of this, you are asked to 

provide a four digit security pin. What is this pin used for, you 

may ask? A couple of things as a matter of fact when it comes to MCI 

service.  Are you starting to see the big picture yet? Focus. Most 

people are not that smart and are gonna pick pin numbers like: 1234, 

1969, 4321, 6969. But then again, how hard could it be to guess an 

actual working pin number?

        Now this is where the 800 number comes in to play. I've also 

discovered that MCI owns the whole exchange of 1 800 484 ****. 

So let's say you call up any number in that exchange. What you'll 

usually get is an automated operator who asks for you to enter 

your 4 digit pin. Let's say for instance you enter 1234. If the 

pin is active on that 800 number it will begin to ring someone's 

home phone and guess who? The person with pin number 1234! Amazing, 

isn't it?  If it doesn't work then it will ask you to re-enter your 

pin and if you get it wrong again you'll be forwarded to a live 

operator. Now where am I going with all this? Wait, it gets better.

        How terribly difficult is it for someone to call up 800 484 **** 

and enter random four digit pins until they finally come across a 

working pin? Ok, so let's say 1234 is in fact a working on this 

particular MCI 800. You call it up, enter your pin and a conversation 

with the person on the other end whom you are trying to own MIGHT go 

something like this:

Person: Hello?

You: Is Janet there?

Person: No, I'm afraid you have the wrong number.

You: Oh, I'm sorry, what number did I call?

Person: 555 1212

You: Oh, that's funny, which area code?

Person: 710

You: Ok, thank you, goodbye.

Person: Bye.

        Ok, so some people might not wanna give out their area code so easily, 

but you'd be surprised just how many people are in fact willing to do 

so and think nothing of it. Think about it, how many wrong number calls 

have you recieved and people ask you which number they dialed?  It 

happens everyday and most people don't think twice about it. It doesn't 

seem like that big of a deal at the time. After reading this you may 

think twice about doing so.

        So now you have the person's area code, home phone number, and MCI Pin,
 

what the hell can we do that? Simple. If you haven't realized by now, 

you have just acquired an MCI Calling Card Number. Now that wasn't so 

hard, was it?  The same pin that is used for your 800 number is also the 

pin used for your calling card. Great security measures on MCI's 

behalf, huh?

        The format of the MCI calling card is as follows:

Area Code + Number + 4 digit PIN

In other words, simply dial 800 888 8000 (Auotmated MCI Calling Card 

Number) and when it asks, enter "your" account info and wa la! You now 

have free long distance all at the expense of some other schmuck,  who 

was too stupid not to sign up with MCI in the first place. On another 

note, you can also place International Calls with your newly acquired 

MCI account. Also, you may note that the account has unlimited minutes 

of use. I've seen these things last for months at a time before anyone 

caught on to what was happening. Just imagine, how many dollars worth of 

fraudulent calls could be racked up at just about anybody's expense due 

to pure stupidity on MCI's behalf.

        MCI really dropped the ball when it comes to security. There are so 

many ways this method of stealing calling cards could be avoided. 

Perhaps, separate pins for each account? That's not too difficult of 

a task. Do you really think MCI cares though? I highly doubt they do 

and the time it would take to change everyone's pin now is more than 

likely something they wouldn't be willing to do. Time is money.

        Also, I've been informed of another hole in the MCI service that you 

could incorporate into this little hustle.  Whenever you call the MCI 

Direct 800's you'll notice that if you push * for about two seconds 

instead of entering any pin, you will automatically be forwarded to a

random MCI subscriber. With that in mind, you could easily pose as an 

MCI Operator and come up with a number of different scenarios to attain 

someone's phone number and pin.  As I stated earlier, we're not really 

doing genius' work here.  Anybody with a little time on their hands, 

such as myself, could have thought of these little scams earlier and 

MCI should realize that.  By not implementing larger security measures 

on their MCI long distance plans, they are basically slapping their 

customers in the face.  Hopefully, someone from MCI might just read this 

article and understand what is happening and can actually do something 

about it for the sake of their customers, but I highly doubt that.

I can also tell you that by speaking to the MCI operators themselves 

you might be able to con them out of a pin and phone number rather 

easily.  About a month ago on a teleconference redxer and myself were 

having a little fun with MCI Worldcom when we forwarded to an operator. 

Redxer was able to get a pin and phone number out of them in about 5 

minutes. Makes you wonder what kind of people they are hiring to work 

for MCI. Obviously not the brightest people on the planet.

I do not encourage anyone to try the things discussed in this analysis 

of a very serious security problem on MCI's behalf.  Doing so would 

more than likely subject you to federal prosecution. Plus, I'm one 

hundred percent positive that MCI logs all calls on their 800 numbers.  

So, unless you have a surefire way of not delivering your ANI, I wouldn't 

even attempt these actions. It's your life though.  I'm sure some of you 

will be trying and won't care what I just said.  Finally, please note, 

you've been warned of the consequences you may face when attempting to 

rip off MCI.

        Well, I'll start off with a quick description of Octal's history.  It 

all started out with DEC's Minicomputers which were 

made to challenge the IBM Supercomputers which were out at the time 

(1960's).  DEC made sure that no software could be moved

from IBM mainframes to DEC Minicomputers, DEC designed its machines 

completely in base 8.  

        Now heres the fun part...

lets try counting to 10 in Octal (base 8, remember) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 

7, 10, 11, 12.  Now, they didnt get rid of 8 and 9, 

they just changed the names to 10 and 11.  They didnt really change the 

names for the column's values though.  The columns 

go as follows: Unit, then to the left of that, 10's column.  But the 

annoying part about that is of course when they 

say '10' it actually is 8.  so the 10's column actually has a value of 

8.  Heres an ASCII graph to show it a bit better.  

It comapres it to Decimal, which if you dont know is our common 

numbering system (taught in schools after 1960's).

Octal           Decimal

Numeralals      Equivalent

1               1
2               2
3               3
4               4
5               5
6               6
7               7
10              8
11              9
12              10
13              11
14              12
15              13
16              14
17              15
20              16
21              17
22              18
23              19
24              20

That should give you a pretty good idea about Octal vs. Decimal.  

        Remember that each column in a given number base has a value base times
 

the column to its right, so the tens column

in Octal is actually the eights column.  The next column is the 

hundreds column, but the hundreds column actually has

a value of 8 x 8, or 64.  Next column has a value of 64 x 8, or 512, 

and next is 512 x 8, or 4,096.

        A digit in the first column (units, or ones) tells hows many units are 

contained in the octal number.  A digit in the next

column to the left, the tens column, tells how many eights are 

contained in the octal number.  A digit in the third column,

the hundreds column, tells how many 64's are in the octal number.  for 

example 400 Octal would mean that the number contains

four 64's.  which is 256.  so the decimal form of 400 octal is 256.

        Lets dissect a number to make conversion a bit easier.  

Octal number 76225

7 would be in the 4096 column, so 7 would = 28672

6 would be in the 512 column, so 6 would = 3072

2 would be in the 64 column, so 2 would = 128

2 would be in the 8 column, so 2 would = 16

5 would be in the 1 column, so 5 would = 5

 28672
  3072
   128
    16
+    5
=31893 in decimal.

And thats that.  It takes a little while to get used too, but not all 

that hard, either.

        Do you remember those old CompuServe numeric accounts?  they looked 

like "76711,470".  Notice theres no number higher

than 7?  Thats because When CompuServe was created (a long time ago) 

they were using a large bank of DEC computers, with all 

their login ID's in octal.  But they changed their systems and started 

using alphabetic ID's.
