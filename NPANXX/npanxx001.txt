Well, here we are. We, TeamPhreak, the IRC whores from 2600.net 
finally got off our asses and put out a zine. TeamPhreak has existed for
a while lurking around irc.2600.net and on the PSTN. But rather than just 
conf and irc all hours of the night, we decided to put together a 
magazine. This first issue has enough to keep you interested for a while. 
We also would like to announce that if you want to contribute, we accept 
articles about phone and computer (in)security. Expect future issues to 
deal with computer information as well. As for now, we have plenty to 
bring out the phreak in you. We hope for the mag to flourish and provide
the h/p community with fresh info, much like past magazines. The early
Phrack issues are a major inspiration to us.


        -Phractal of TeamPhreak.

OPERATOR 21**.

Welcome to the BellSouth Operator Assistance Training Manual 2.5
This manual will show you how to operate efficently within our
regional call centers. Different etiquettes may be required in
different regional settings. Please ask your supervisor if you
have any inquiries.

I. Starting your day the RIGHT way (OPRS 9:00A BGN/SHFT)

When you leave for your call center in the morning, make sure
that you make arrangements to arrive at least 10 minuts earlier
than you are scheduled. Bring all of your belongings to your 
workstation,
including personal items, and safety items. You will also need your
security card should a member of our personnell ask you to verify
your identity. Failure to bring items may result in in-efficency
of your workflow or posible ejection from the facility.

Please note that you are only allowed to enter the building 10 minutes
before your shift. Once you leave for the day, you will only be 
permitted
to re-enter the building with a police escort.

Make sure your workstation is clean and free of dust or foreign objects
left by previous operators. Always make sure that your station is clean
when you leave for the day. Alcohol wipes and other sanitizationary
items are available at the resource table in the front of your 
supervisor's
station. Should supplies be low, or empty, please notify your 
supervisor
of this inadequacy.

You may greet the surrounding operators, but please remember that they
are working, and a quiet environment is necessary to process calls on 
the
Bellsouth quality level. Persons who adversely effect the workplace 
environment
will be promptly removed by security personnel.

Sit quietly at your workstation for a few moments to clear your mind. 
Make
sure that personal problems dont enter the workplace. To the customer, 
you
are probably the first friendly voice they have heard all day long, so 
please
be as friendly as possible.

Clear your throat 3 times or less, but no more than 6 times. Your job 
will
place un-needed stress on your vocal cavity.

II. Begin your shift (ALL OPR.)

Sit upright at your console. Feet touching the floor, slightly apart.
Your shoulders should be aligned with the bottom of your viewscan, and
your wrists should come middle ways of your keyboard. If these 
locations
do not match up, adjust your chair using the levers on the bottom of 
it.
A supervisor will be glad to assist you should your chair be 
un-comfortable.

WARNING:  FAILURE TO OBEY THESE URGONOMIC STANDARDS CAN RESULT IN
INJURY TO YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Insert your headset jack in the receptacles found underneath your
console. These receptacles are marked ANOD. and CATHOD.

Now, depress the START key. Today, you will be running the PRACTICE 
lesson.
You may need to re-read this section in order to obtain maximum 
learning.

A Blue rectangle will appear on your screen, with the traditional 
BELLSOUTH
logo under the textbox. Type in the text as following.

Type in BELLSOUTH_1, Then BELLSOUTH_TRAIN.1
Press the START key again.

You should hear a single tone. This means you are logged in and your 
console
is ready for operation. If you hear 2 tones, log out, and step away 
from
your console IMMEDIATELY. Hail your supervisor IMMEDIATELY, and alert
a condition 26.

Now, press ACPT_RDY. This will alert the system that you are READY to 
start
accepting calls. An incoming call is preceeded by a single tone. Press
ACPT to accept the call. Here are the demo calls. There are 5 demo

 ----  Before you will be able to dial-in via the CSX platform, you must:
  
     1) Have an active SecurID (NAC or DIALS) account 
  
     2) Have recieved an E-Mail confirmation from the Remote Access and Security Management

----   Using Your SecurID Card for thee FFirst Time


 The first time you attempt to use your SecurID card, you will be required to change your
 four digit PIN code. It is recommended that you do this prior to making your first 
 connection. This new will be effective for 120 days.
 If you are using a script to automate the connection process, THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK!!!!
 no one in BellSouth supports scripts and problems are harder to detect with scripts 
 running. It his recommended that you disable all scripts and login manually each time. 
 If you are having problems changing your securID pin and you are using a script, disable it
 and follow the procedure stated above (in number 1).

3.-----Definitions--------



A. CallForwarding - A service offered by local phone companies 
to their Subscribers and a feature of PBX systems that allows a User 
to make calls Dialed to their Phone Ring to a differnt phone or phone number. 


B. Caller ID -  A feature offered by local phone companies 
that sends the phone number (and often the name of the caller) down the
phone line in a digital data packet between the first and second ring.
To receive teh data, a subscriber that has signed up for the service
needs to have a caller-ID unit (also called a caller-ID box) plugged into 
the phoneline. The caller-ID unit displays the name and number of the calling
party for each incoming cal. CallerID only works if the caller and the called
party's phone service is fed out of a C.O (central office) that has Caller ID 
capability. If the C.O does not have Caller-ID capability, the display will
read "out of area" to the called party. If the called party does not have
caller service, they will get a display that says "no data sent." 


C. ANI (Automatic Number Identification) - This feature, offered by local phone companies, 
sends the phone number (and often the name of the caller) down the phone line in a digital 
data packet between the first and second ring. To receive teh data, a subscriber that
has signed up for the service needs to have a CAller ID unit (also called caller ID - 
box) plugged into the phone line. The caller-ID unit displays the name and the number
of the calling party for each incoming call. Caller ID only works if the the caller and
the called partys phone service is fed out of a C.O tht has caller-ID capability. If The
C.O does not have caller-ID capability, then the display will read "out of area" to the 
called party. If the called party does not have caller service they will get a display
that says "No data Sent."

D. C.O (Central Office> - A building that houses a telecommunications switching or trafficking 
system. Typical switching systems installed in central offices in North America are Lucent 
Technologies' 5ess and Northern Telecom's DMS family of switches. There are five classes of 
Central offices and five major parts to a central office. as a whole these parts are referred 
to as inside plant.

*****Section 5*****The DATU Modes and Practical Uses*************************
*****************************************************************************



                         


        [disclaimer: unless you are a certified technician, any DATU you access 
is not your property and therefore is electronic trespassing into the 
insides of your local Central Office. Know what you're getting into. This
information may or may not have been test by someone certified to operate 
a DATU. This is merely information, nothing more.]

I. Intro
        Well, a great many of articles have been written recently 
regarding the Direct Access Test Unit (DATU). A DATU is a computer 
that you can connect to via the PSTN, all you need is the phone number. 
My local Central Office uses a AT&T 5ESS switch, so I know for a fact that 
those switches use DATUs, I am not sure about others, like DMS switches,
but chances are, your local, residential Central Office has a DATU. DATUs 
use the ring and tip wires a lot to test lines, the ring and tip wires 
are often the red and green wires that go into your phone.

        DATUs are tubular little wonders that allow the phone company and 
phreaks to perform tests on local loops. To test a line outside your 
Central Office's area, you need the DATU number for the Central Office 
that serves it.

I should mention that this article discusses but is not necessarily 
limited to testing POTS lines.

From the PSTN to your home:

II. The Format of DATUs

The format of most DATUs is xxx-9935

It is up to you to find an exchange that works, it shouldn't be too hard 
since most non-toll COs only serve less than 15 or so exchanges. If you 
still can't find it, the DATU could be anyplace else, or you have a 
different switch, but for most 9935 is the suffix for the DATU. You can 
try wardialing for them. You will recognize a DATU by it's weird prompt. 
It is a 440hz tone sounding like a low hum. The prompt is asking you to
enter in the DATU password on your DTMF keypad. All passwords that I have 
found to work are 4 digits, the default is 1111. If it isn't the password, 
try pairs like 3535 or 9292, i have found some that work with pairs, as 
well as 4300. Then again, don't try and brute force the password, at least 
not from home. If the Telco notices a lot of failed DATU logins then they 
will contact you or they will change the password, causing a headache for
all the linemen and phreaks who already know it. Use your head :)



The real hardcore hardware nerdy stuff of DATUs can be acquired by reading 
Phrack 52, and PPM issue 2 and 3. 

Therefore I'm not going to heavily explain what all the functions do 
inside the DATU.

Also, for a quick reference, check Telec's article @ phonerangers.org

-Once you have the DATU, and the 440Hzz ttone, you will have to dial the 
password using DTMF tones. There are two accounts/passwords THAT I KNOW OF
for each DATU. There is the normal account which is a 4 digit password, 
and there is an ADMIN account, which is * followed by 7 digits.

III. Test Mode

Default passwords for the normal account are 1111 and 4300
Once inside the DATU using the normal account you will hear a second 
440 Hz tone prompting you to enter in a seven digit phone number that 
is served by the switch the DATU is at. After that you should hear an OK 
to confirm, otherwise you did something wrong, or the line is busy. You 
can perform tests on the line by using the corresponding codes:

Code:   Test:                     Fuction:
1       ----                      Announces the menu over the phone

2       Audio Montior             Hear SCRAMBLED traffic on the phone, can
                                  be used to test if there is activity on
                                  line or not.

33      Short to Ground           Shorts the ring, tip and ground wires of
                                  your line back at the CO(red and green 
                                  wires)

37      Ring Ground               Shorts ground and ring wires 

38      Tip Ground                Shorts ground and tip wires

44      Ring/Tip High Tone        Bursts a high level tone onto the Tip 
                                  and Ring Wires

47      Ring High Tone            Bursts a high level tone onto Ring wire,
                                  Tip grounded

48      Tip Hight Tone            Bursts a high level tone onto Tip wire, 
                                  Ring grounded

5       Low level Tone            Bursts low level tone onto tip and ring 
                                  wires

                                  the time 10  minutes is the max, to 
                                        prevent things like a line being open

                                  test, like the Control-C of a DATU.

IV. ADMIN MODE:

/!#@$%@#$

HI, I just want to make a point of saying that the following is info is 
NOT confirmed, I am writing this from my experiences using admin mode. 
For example, I don't know if option 3 actually has the power to delete 
exchanges or not, i haven't tried it, and neither should you, really.

The Admin mode is entered by entering in a * followed by a seven digit 
passsword. I currently am un-aware of any 'defaults' for this. The 
options in the admin account allow you to do things that pertain more to
the Central Office and how it serves the public. You cannot test local 
loops with the ADMIN ACCOUNT. Once you get a valid password, you should 
NOT hear a second 440hz tone, you should just automatically hear an 'OK'. The
following codes work for the ADMIN mode:

***PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ACCESS HERE, EXPLORE WITH CARE! YOU COULD SERIOUSLY
CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOU AND YOUR LOCAL NEIGHBORS SERVED BY THE LOCAL CO. I 
WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO CHANGE OR ACCESS ANY OPTIONS 
OTHER THAN TO CLEAR YOUR TRACKS(covered later).

There are other kinds of lines and functions that you can do with the DATU
computer, but I suggest you look them up in Phrack or PPM, or maybe I'll 
write a part 2 sometime later :)

BTW, the only tests that work on a busy line are: Audio Monitor, Low Level
Tone, and Permanent Signal Release.

To cover  your tracks, clear the onboard logs, aka Timers, via Option 7.

V. Practical Uses for DATUs:

Busy Lines: 
        Let's say you call a number, be a friend, or wardialing and its 
busy. You can use the audio montitor to test if there is actual traffic 
on the line, if not, then maybe the line is somesort of test line or 
someone left a phone off the hook. I have found audio monitor useful when
trying to hack weird modern COCOTs. Let's say you know a BBS or some 
carrier that you want to connect to, but it's busy, like a COCOT's 
computer modem, you can blast a Low Level Tone to throw off the modem and
have it get disconected, you can also remotely disconnect any modem from 
a connection if you know the number of the line. (You can only do this if 
the line has a ground going into thehouse, or building and not just at
the CO) If there is a number you have found that is ALWAYS busy, i mean 
ALWAYS, try  opening the line and dialing it right after the line is 
shorted back. I find that COCOTS almost always have grounds in them.

*Most residential lines will not hear Low Level Tone, because they have 
no ground going into the phone.

Beige Boxing in a large Telco Boxes:
        When beiging in a large telcobox, depending on where you are, it 
can be a puzzle to find the right pair to connect to the line you want to, 
if it is a specific line that you are looking for. You can use High Level
Tone Tests to look for the pair, when you reach a pair that has a beeping
you can bet its the same line you inputted into the DATU. If the line is 
busy, or you want to be more stealthy, you can use the low level tone, 
which is less likely for someone to hear unless they have a ground going 
into their phone, most don't nowadays.

Remote Busy Box:
        Remember the Busy Box? You crossed the green and red wires to busy
out any line. The green and red wires are tip and ring, so test code 33 
can remotely turn any local line into a busy box since the tip and ring 
wires are shorted out at the CO. Be in mind that most likely you can only
keep a line shorted for 10 minutes after you hang up, if you want longer,
just keep dialing in every 10 minutes. The same goes for opening a line 
(shutting it off) or any tone tests.

(Hint about time limits, study ADMIN functions)

Some notes about Audio Monitor:
   
--- The Audio Monitor feature is not aa ttap or eavesdropping feature, you 
can not understand any speech or capture any DTMF tones traveling along 
the line though the DATU. It is merely used to verify that there is indeed 
activity on a line, if the line is busy and there is no acitivy, then 
there could be a problem.

VI. Theoretical Uses for DATUs:

Creating Phone Numbers:
        Have you ever dreamed of creating a phone number out of thin air,
with no billable address like the Legion of Doom did back in the day? 
Well, the first step could be creating a new exchange to use your numbers 
on. Once the exchange is created, I can't really tell you where to go 
from there. If you find other ways of entering the switch, like thru a 
dialup or over some Packet Switched Network, then go for it, but be 
careful, respect the telco's turf, and DON'T MODIFY OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF!

Mapping Switch Hardware:

        I have heard some DATUs announce the switch they are attached to.
This can be useful to find out info on how to remotely explore the switch. 
Also, if Permanent Signal Release is enabled, then you could find a stroke 
of unbelievable good luck, Step by Step switching, which in theory of 
course, all kinds of things would work, like blueboxing (inband 
signalling), black boxes, etc...


VII. Final Notes:

DATUs are for testing lines only, they apply certain tones and can short 
lines, but they are not used to add features or anything to a line. You 
cannot add three way calling to your line through a DATU. You cannot add 
Call Forwarding to you line, you cannot get ISDN or ADSL. And please test
responsably. If you keep opening a line to annoy someone then the 
password will most likely get changed.

As far as I know, if you have the dialup and password, you can access the
DATU from anyplace on the PSTN, there is no confirmation that you are 
calling from a local number or anything, so If you are in NY, you can test 
lines in California providing you have the DATU k0d3z.
