 To start off with, I'd just like to say this file is a collectithe
 latest BBS crashes. Many people have grudges and reasons to 'crash' a bbs,
 well this file is served as an aid to them and also to sysops who want to
 prevent their own bbs' from being attacked. And that's enuff talk for now,
 let's get on with the good stuff (everything is in cookbook format for speedy
 reading).


[-=:  Apple Net :=-]


1. Post a message (can be bbs,feedback,newuser etc.)
2. Press space bar util you get to the very last line (40th col.)
3. type ctrl-D
4. (after the word wrap to next line) Type any dos command (Preferrably FP)
5. get into editor ('/E')
6. list the program
7. You should be in basic or executing whatever dos command you entered


Requirements:

- Must have wordwrap activated
- 40 columns mode should be activated
- Their must be a (L)ist command in the editor


[-=: Telecat 2.x & 3.0 :=-]


 2.x
-----


1. Go to the board section
2. Newscan the last board accessable
3. After the first message, type 'B' at the prompt (To jump to next board)


Results:

- If it was the last board on the bbs, chances arethat will break into Basic
- If not, then it will go on to the next board (which is handy and surpassess
  the security level crap)

 3.0
-----


1. Post Message
2. Type a line of text
3. type ctrl-V


Results:

- This should either hang the system or break into basic
- It is trying to center the line but it fucks up

[-=: GBBS Pro :=-]

Method 1:

1. Go the the editor
2. Hold down tab key
3. or press space and type ctrl-C

Method 2:

1. Upload to a full volume

Method 3:

1. read the userlist
2. hang up when it gets to the Sysop
3. call back and log on and you'll be a sysop

[-=: Proving Grounds :=-]

Method 1:

1. (On older versions) Enter decimal or negative numbers

Method 2:

1. Call board and enter the user number of a Remote sysop
2. Enter any bs for a pw
3. Do the same thing again (more garbage the 2nd time it asks)
4. Now enter your real number and pass
5. At the first input prompt type 'Remote'
6. This should give you the Remote Sysop menu and access

Notes:

- Using Sysop's user# will give you 10 extra minutes on system
- The second method works only on unmoded newer versions of Proving Grounds

[-=: Renegade 7-17 :=-]

Method 1:

1.  Upload an ansi bomb.
2.  Go into the archive menu.
3.  Ask to view it.

[-=: Unix / Venix :=-]

1.  Call it up, at the Login: prompt type one of the following:
    Root
    Sys
    System
2.  Now it will say Password:
3.  Type one of those again <Does not have to be the same one.>
4.  You're in!  Now all you need are the unix commands...
5.  That will be explained in another file.


Thanks to Memorex for the help.
