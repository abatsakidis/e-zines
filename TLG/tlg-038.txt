well ever wonder how to play in an ansi file sequence? well to have fun i'll
tell ye the parameters used in ANSI escape sequences. they are are:

Pn
    Numeric parameter. Specifies a decimal number.
 
Ps
    Selective parameter. Specifies a decimal number that you use to select
    a function. You can specify more than one function by separating the
    parameters with semicolons.
 
PL
    Line parameter. Specifies a decimal number that represents one of the
    lines on your display or on another device.
 
Pc
    Column parameter. Specifies a decimal number that represents one of the
    columns on your screen or on another device.
 
ANSI escape sequences for cursor movement, color, and editing
 
In the following list of ANSI escape sequences, the abbreviation ESC
represents the ASCII escape character 27 (1Bh), which appears at the
beginning of each escape sequence.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


ESC[PL;PcH
    Cursor Position: Moves the cursor to the specified position
    (coordinates). If you do not specify a position, the cursor moves to the
    home positionÄÄthe upper-left corner of the screen (line 0, column
    0). This escape sequence works the same way as the following Cursor
    Position escape sequence.
 
ESC[PL;Pcf
    Cursor Position: Works the same way as the preceding Cursor Position
    escape sequence.
 
ESC[PnA
    Cursor Up: Moves the cursor up by the specified number of lines without
    changing columns. If the cursor is already on the top line, ANSI.SYS
    ignores this sequence.
 
ESC[PnB
    Cursor Down: Moves the cursor down by the specified number of lines
    without changing columns. If the cursor is already on the bottom line,
    ANSI.SYS ignores this sequence.
 
ESC[PnC
    Cursor Forward: Moves the cursor forward by the specified number of
    columns without changing lines. If the cursor is already in the
    rightmost column, ANSI.SYS ignores this sequence.
 
ESC[PnD
    Cursor Backward: Moves the cursor back by the specified number of
    columns without changing lines. If the cursor is already in the leftmost
    column, ANSI.SYS ignores this sequence.
 
ESC[s
    Save Cursor Position: Saves the current cursor position. You can move
    the cursor to the saved cursor position by using the Restore Cursor
    Position sequence.
 
ESC[u
    Restore Cursor Position: Returns the cursor to the position stored
    by the Save Cursor Position sequence.
 
ESC[2J
    Erase Display: Clears the screen and moves the cursor to the home
    position (line 0, column 0).
 
ESC[K
    Erase Line: Clears all characters from the cursor position to the
    end of the line (including the character at the cursor position).
 
ESC[Ps;...;Psm
    Set Graphics Mode: Calls the graphics functions specified by the
    following values. These specified functions remain active until the next
    occurrence of this escape sequence. Graphics mode changes the colors and
    attributes of text (such as bold and underline) displayed on the
    screen.
 
    Text attributes
       0    All attributes off
       1    Bold on
       4    Underscore (on monochrome display adapter only)
       5    Blink on
       7    Reverse video on
       8    Concealed on
 
    Foreground colors
       30    Black
       31    Red
       32    Green
       33    Yellow
       34    Blue
       35    Magenta
       36    Cyan
       37    White
 
    Background colors
       40    Black
       41    Red
       42    Green
       43    Yellow
       44    Blue
       45    Magenta
       46    Cyan
       47    White
 
    Parameters 30 through 47 meet the ISO 6429 standard.
