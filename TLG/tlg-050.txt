    Five days ago today, a bomb of ANFO's [Ammonia Nitrate &
 Diesel Fuel]   blew the face off an Oklahoma Federal Building.
 Inside the building  resided a Secret Service office, a Drug
 Enforcement Agency office,   a Marine Req. Office, a FBI office,
 ATF office, and among many other things  a day care center open
 to the public. Today, 4-23-95, Is now a national  day of mourning
 for the victims.
 
    Original blame was placed on the middle easterners, who were
 by FAR  the biggest suspect. But evidence as it builds shows that
 it was Americans,  or to put it more correctly Non-Americans
 (They Denounced Citizenship)  that destroyed the lives of
 workers, friends, relatives, and children.  And for this, I
 salute you.
  
    I no longer question the motives of the mad-bombers. To some
 they may  be the new anti-Christ's. I used to feel hate and anger
 towards the bombers.  Whoever they are. Now... I question the
 motives of the government. 
    
    As 'John Doe #1' was carried to the police van, the public
 cries could be heard uncensored through national CNN TV. "Fuck
 off!", "Child Murder!", and  cries of the sort rang out. And for
 showing no remorse on your face, I  salute you.
 
    Clinton has promised to push for the death penalty. So has
 Janet Reno, a  official OPPOSED to the death penalty. They want
 their JUSTICE. Their lame  two-faced, hypocritical justice. 
      
    They want their justice, AND I WANT MINE. Why would a federal
 building  share a child care center with the ATF? FBI? SS?
 Obvious targets of   foreign aggression and domestic aggression. A
 child care program should HAVE  NEVER BEEN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
 LIKE THAT. A program for the people who work  in the building, I
 understand, but not for the publics children. However, A private
 one shouldn't even be in the same building. To the  survivors,
 For your strength and courage, I salute you. 
    
    And if they push for the death penalty.. I encourage the death
 penalty.  Death to the government, For placing innocent children
 in the face of  danger, which resulted in many dead. Why then,
 did you put a day care  center here? Why? So if anyone attacked
 the government, Millions of mindless  minions would run around in
 rage because someone killed American children.  
    
    This is a blunt attempt at brain-washing the American public. The
 same   American children that you use to control the minds of us,
 that you use   to turn people against people, are the same
 children that would have NO  RIGHTS when they are in high school,
 just years down the road. These   children are OLD enough to DIE
 for YOUR cause, but will not be OLD  enough for possession of
 FREEDOM of Speech until they are out of SCHOOL, and 18 years old. 
 And for this government, I say "FUCK YOU!".
 
    You placed these KIDS in danger so that if any thing ever
 happened you  and your little minions and claim "You killed our
 children" in your squeaky  whinny voices. "You killed our
 children, And now, we must kill you."  
 
    You have made these children into a excuse to kill your
 nations enemies. If  communists blew the building up, You would
 have attacked Russia. You would  use these poor defenseless kids
 to destroy any national threats that you   couldn't ever justify
 before. If your actions meet your words, I expect the  
 punishment of whoever's idea and whoever supported this. 
    
    And to all you with your faith in our, no wait, YOUR
 government, remember   they are using you. They used your kids.
 They'll use YOU. Hear my words...  Hear my words, For one day the
 truth will emerge. And to the rescue workers  for your brave,
 mindless heroism, I salute you.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
    To all those hell-bent on fighting the oppressive system, I salute you.                      
                      May your dreams become reality.
