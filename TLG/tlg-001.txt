*** get fucked. **************************************************************
******************************************************************************
               

        Now I know in the begining of this magazine you probally read
     a disclaimer telling you that basicly you have no right to try and
     get us into trouble for writing this file. However, I know have  
     another kind of disclaimer. But this one, is a warning. 
       
        As most of you probally know, I am a skinhead. This means, what
     I write doesn't apply to jocks, preps, fags, possers, trendies, or
     any other little "wrong" prejudice stereotype. (NOT RACIAL MIND YOU).
     See, I know some one in every single one of those catagories is going
     to get their greasy little hands on this, so right now, I have two 
     things to tell you... FUCK YOU and FEAR ME. FEAR ME FOR REAL. I have
     lost almost everything that means anything... And if you do fuck with
     me, I WILL FUCK YOU UP. 

        Right about now your probally think I am hinding behind my handle.
     But the truth is, I have made a huge name for myself. In this state.
     Out of this state, and out of this COUNTRY. For that reason, I don't
     have a very low prophile and its not hard to find out who I am. Also
     I am the ONLY skinhead hacker in Warren County, and probally 908.
     
        Now this file your about to read.. I wrote it in DECEMBER of '94.
      I wrote it at the time where i saw everything fall apart. The hackers
      became MIA. It wasn't untill about a couple of days ago when two
      friends helped me get back into the shatter remains and ruins of my
      old scene. I'd like to think Mr. Sandman of Titaniam Expose for bring
      908 back to life, and Mog & Mulder for kicking me back to the scene.
      

                           THANK YOU.
                             Abigwar

  OK listen here guys!  Now that we have weeded out the undesirables lets
 move on. Shall we?
    
   Alright, The scene is dying. (Huh?) It doesn't get much more blunt than
 that. People just don't give two shits anymore. (Huh?) I know you all have
 real lives. Well most of you anyway. But I'm sure you can find spare time.
 Even I have been having trouble coming up with time lately, But still, I can
 put something off to the side, and do that later. 

   Now, What would one of my files be with out my paranoid ramblings about the
 takeover of America, and the oppression of our people? Well, Allot better I
 suppose. But like usual, here it is anyway.  Why don't you people fight any
 thing???

   Some one tells you to do something, and you do it. I don't mean like a 
 friend telling you to try a spliff, I mean like some one in authority telling
 you to change the way you think, act, dress, or anything else with evil 
 consequences like being thrown out of school? Or having a fucked up future?
 I'm so sick of it.

   People think they can walk all over us, just because a little bit of 
 authority went to their heads.  And you know what's sad? They can. They do.
 And they will continue until we ALL start to resist. Damn it, You don't 
 people do not seem to realize it, but every time they step on us, other
 people think they can get away with doing the same. It builds up damn it.
 Then people get creative, and make more shit to oppress us with.

   No one really believes me. No one who I talk to anyway. Only a few people.
 I want you to open your eyes, and look around you. Take a GOOD and CLOSE 
 look.

   I used to want to change the world. Back when I started with BGR. Now I
 realize that I can't change the world, and that I would be a complete moron
 to think it. Then, I focused my attentions. Maybe to avoid failure, Maybe
 I was running away from everything to avoid looking like a hypocrite. 
 Now, if I find I changed one person, If I find I opened one persons eyes,
 It all would be worth it. All the effort from over the past years, would be
 completely paid off.

   ...And I keep thinking it. I keep hoping one day I will hear that someone
 understands what I am saying. And yet, that little dream has gone unawnsered.
 Maybe no one gives a damn what happens to them. And from me to them: I don't
 give a damn what happens to you either. But from me to anyone who cares,
 DON'T EVER LET THEM TAKE YOU. DON'T EVER LET THEM TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU.
 Its your life, you have the right to choose. The government may not think
 so, But I do, and thats what counts.

   ...So all the pride of the hacker scene has faded? I don't think so. Where
 is it? Where???? Hiding I suppose. Maybe it was all lost when the Wares 
 dudes came along. Or maybe when the 'artists' or what ever the fuck they 
 call them selves came along. (No offense to any 'artists') But what ever
 happened, BRING IT BACK! 

   So now, I am torn between calling this "Peptalk"  or "The last of the 
 Hackers". Peptalk sounds prissy, but it is what I hoped it to be. And so
 if I am the last of this breed, You know I wont betray it. And you know
 I wont betray my skinhead scene either. I have been bound for life, weather
 I grow up or not, it will always be in my blood. 

   Once something this powerful is in your blood, it may never leave. And
 all those who come and go like the trendy little wanker army they are, 
 mean nothing to me anymore. I spit on you if you run like water, And I'll
 piss on your grave. 

   Pride. Ha. How can I have pride, when everything is falling apart? When
 we had it so great? How can I have pride in this monstrosity that we call
 our H/P/ect. scene? It was funny to watch last night, a show on The 
 Discovery channel, called the 'Hack Attack'. So funny.  It made us seem like
 we were the worlds plague. Originally I thought only skinheads were plagued
 with this cancer. Now they are attacking hackers? The only person on the
 whole show who made any truth out of anything was Emmanual Goldstien [2600],
 who is often considered a sale-out bastard anyway. Sorry I fucked up the
 spelling of your name Goldstein. Ha, What do I care, he will never read this
 anyway.

   As much as I hate to, I may just sum  this up with a Gwar song. I hate 
 Gwar. But, I'M SO SICK OF YOU! Most of you run like water, and those of
 you who don't, I appreciate your existence. I hate the world.
