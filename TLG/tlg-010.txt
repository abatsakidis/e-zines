   I am a hypocrite. Don't listen to me. I am a fool.

 Description: These are the plans to a light sensitive bomb, An Abigwar 
              original. You need a train yard, or a place where they park
              trains over night. Best train company to try is conrail.


  This is an easy way to get acsess to a light sensitive switch, and every
 thing you need for a bomb, except the explosives, And if you are intelegent
 even the explosives.
   
  First of all you need to find a train yard. This is a place where they will
 park trains for an indefinate amount of time. In my case trains maybe parked 
 from 2- hours up intill 48+ hours. Usually when a train is going to be there
 at night it will have the switch we are looking for. Look for a silverish
 box on the last car of a park train. If it is night look for a yellow 
 light blinking at 1 or 2 second intervals. On (1second) off (1second) on...

  Make sure there is no one around. If their are people *IN* the engine some 
 where down the tracks, do your deed quickly. Run up and grab the box. Press
 the red button, The top one if they are both black. Now look at the back of
 the box. It should have a black cable running off it. Follow it down, its 
 about a foot and a half long. Unclip it. Now pull the box out. It should 
 weigh about 25-45 pounds. 

  Get out of there. Or if you scoped out the area, and there are running  
 engines down the line without people in them, you might want to stick around.
 If you are going to be adventourus, and stick around, go to =*=STAY=*= if
 you feel like you need to get out of their, something in your gut is wrong
 or you know there are people there, go to =*=LEAVE=*=.

                                
 ------------------------------- =*= STAY =*= -------------------------------

  Ok, Go up to the engine. If it is a BLUE conrail engine, then you're in 
 luck. If it isn't, you are on your own from here. There will probally be a 
 couple of engines. Go up onto the rail. Just use the steps on the side. Go 
 up the steps on the BACK side, behind the cab. You can go infront of the 
 cab later if you want.

  Now, take a look inside. Look in the cab FIRST. JUST IN CASE. If some one
 is in there, use your head. DON'T RUN for gods sake. Ask some question as if
 you are intrested, and you knew there where people up there. 

  If it's all clear go back to the back of the engine. There will be a set
 of double doors that say "Tool Box" ,"Emergany tools", "Fire Extinguisher" 
 or anything to that effect in it. AND DON'T BE AN IDIOT AND FART AROUND IN
 THE DOOR THAT SAYS "Danger, 9000 volts", DUH! Go in the tool box room. Look
 around. There should be alot of cool stuff. A fire extinguisher, an ax, a
 large hammer.. And a bunch of other stuff. Oh, by the way, it will be warm
 in this room, so don't think the train is on fire.

  Get all the fun stuff, and look for a box that says "FLARES", or  
 "EXPLOSIVES".  All trains have these in them, and sometimes they are in 
 this room. If they arn't don't worry, they are in another compartment, so 
 just look around. 
  
  If you find a little packet, Kind of thick, with two wires running off the
 side, THOSE ARE EXPLOSIVES. Pressure bombs to be exact. They are fun. Read
 the instructions on the side of them.
  
 ------------------------------ =*= LEAVE =*= ------------------------------

  Ok, So you left. Thats understandable.  Take your box, and open it up.
 This is done by turning the two black knobs on the front of the box. Turn
 them 1/4 or 1/2 of a full turn. Then the top will hinge open. Lets take a
 look at it and see if we have the same boxes. 
 
  There are two buttons on the side. On red, on black. Red (the top one) 
 turns the light and the LED off. Black (the bottom one) turns the light and 
 the little LED on. There is a small dingus sticking out near the two buttons.
 this is the light sensor. If the green LED is lite up, and the light doesn't
 flash, stick your finger over the dingus. Hold it there for a second. If it
 flashed then good. If not, does it have a big black battery inside it?

  Inside the box is some circutry, and a big black battery. Lets get this 
 fucker ready. Cut the two wires leading to the light bulb. Cut them as close
 to the light as you can. These are attached to your explosive.

  You have a bunch of  choices. Basicly, i just use the box it comes with for
 the explosive container. That way i don't have to worry about disassembling
 it. From here it is self explanitory. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE. What i mean this
 time is, MAKE SURE it is LIGHT out when you turn the box back on after the
 explosives are wired in. Also, make sure the dingus is free of obstructions.

  If your not careful in this way, BANG... Your dead.
