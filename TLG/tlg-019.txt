         Considering that TLG Editor's/Writer's are superior to the rest
    of the human race it is only right that they should have thier own
    type of writing style, Not just the topic but the word. I decided to
    put together a sort of language to be used in writing. If you happen
    to be  TLG writer then USE IT! For if you don't Satan Will rip your
    spine out your butt. A little hint: A good way to stay in the right
    jargon is to say it in Scottish. Tis a bit mer fun laddy's!
