	hello all you phreakers out there.  this is how to make a crunch box.
a crungh box is basicly nothing more than installing a phone jack in a grey
box(one of those multi line boxes outside in a suburbin neighborhood) or in an
apartment box.
	crunch boxes are useful because they eliminate the need for a beige
box by adding a jack into yer phavorite phreak site.  this is useful because
if you need to use the line to call that narly board out in bumfuct idaho,
you dont need to kill the whire from the pcmia modem card, because those
little whires are like 15 bucks a pop! and i, even tho i have a job, still
dont have enough money to pay for them.

what you will need:
	acomplace
	alagator clips (2)
	balls
	beige box. (just to test the line if you are to lazy)
	crazy glue
	enough external phone wire to make it to your spot. 
	flashlight
	flat head screwdriver (maby philips depends on the jack)
	needle nose plyers
	phone (no need for a beige box now!)
	regular phone jack from radio shack
	thin phone wire, make it single line but you'll need 2 of um.
	
phase I: at home!
	-get the phone jack out of the package you swiped it in.
	-open the jack and disconect the whires from the plate inside, they
	-schould all screw out. be careful not to rip the wires from the jack
	 itself you need them.
				  _
	-    .r. . . .y.         (_  hole the whire to jack gose in
	     .        _.        rygb red yellow green black duh!
	    []       (_.          [] a little gery box with 4 wires
	     .         .             coming out of it. this is the jack itself
	     .g. . . .b.

	-line 69, squeese the neerest member of the opposate sex!
	-now take the plyers and bend the plastic around the jack off so that
	 the jack comes out with 4 wires attached to it.
	-take the needle nose plyers again, and streighten out the outside
	 connectors in the jack.
	  ______
	 |      |  the 1234 are the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th wires inside the box.
	 |      |   the 1st and 4th (outside ones) schould be the ones you 
	 | 1234 |   strieghtened. good. now take them out. they schould be 
	 |------|   the black and yellow wires. if not, just make sure that 
	 | .... |   the ones you took are NOT the middle two.

	-there is yer crunch box. 
	 
phase IIa: the streets.
	-well i'm not gonna go into specifix on where to set up the box.
	 just make sure it is a low 5-0 area, and it is late.
	-get to that kewl phreak spot, open up the case. there schould be
	 a crooked ladder of conections on the left side. like so.
	 x        and they go down more. find where the existing wires go 
	    x     to. they usualy start at the top. you can use the falsh
	 x        light if you cant see in the dark like the rest of us 
	    x     aliens. W00Pz. o-well. 
	-use the beige box to test the lines find out wich one is a good
	 connect.
	-glue the crunch box in somewhere on the side. and connect the red
	 wire to the left conection rod, and the green to the right conection
	 rod( you might need extra wire for this.
	-done.

phase IIb: ready made beige box!
	-take the crunch box and attach 2 alagator clips, one on each wire.
	-conect phone into crunch box.
	-now you have a beige box.

phase IIc: extended crunch box
	-ok this is riskyer then the regular, but more accesable.
	-you need an extra requirement, a place to run a line.
	   -find somewere with dirt or something to cover the whireline all
	    the way to the spot you are gonna be at.
	   -the spot can be behind a sched or in the woods, but it must be
	    away fron the grey box neer the street.
	-open the grey box.
	-puncture hole in bottom of box.
	-get acomplaces to start a 6 inch ditch from the box to the spot.
	 my favorit way is to use a fat headed screwdriver, run it threw the
	 ground, and pit the wire in after it. less time, less mess, less
	 evadence!
	-run wire from outside, threw the hole, into the box.
	-find a good connect with your beige box.
	-run the wire behind all the wacky things in the grey box and connect
	 it to the 2 termanals you just tested.
	-get acomplaces to fill in the hole.
	-close grey box.
	-go to the spot.
	-puncture hole in a coffe can and run the wire threw that.
	-install the crunch box onto the wires you used in the grey box.
	-wala, an external phone jact from some guys house.
	-just be careful not to use it allot, all the time! or you
	-might get caught.

this is my personalised discalimer. as if there isnt enoughf of them!
	if you (the person reading this) get caught. it is your fault. i did
