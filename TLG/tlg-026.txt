Form: Internal Revenu Sevice
Subject: Increased Tax Payments


      Dear Taxpayers:
             
             The only thing the Internal Revenu Sevice has not taxed is
      your pecker.. This is due to the fact that 40% of the time it is 
      hanging around unemployed, 30% of the time it is pissed off, 20% of 
      the time it is hard up, and 10% of the time it is employed, but it 
      operates it the hole.. Furthermore, it has two dependents and the 
      are both nuts.
       

             Accordingly, After March 1, 1996 your pecker will be taxed 
      based on its size, using the "Pecker-Checker Scale" below. Determine 
      your catagory and insert the additional tax under "Other Taxes," 
      Page 2, Part V, Line 61 of your Standard Income Tax Return.



                            PECKER-CHECKER SCALE
                            컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
            10-12 inches .............. Luxury Tax      $50.00
       
             8-10 inches .............. Pole Tax        $25.00

             6-8  inches (Privilege)                    $15.00

             4-6  inches .............. Nuisance Tax    $ 5.00


             Note:  Anyone under 4 inches is eliible for a refund.
             PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR AN EXTENSION....................
             Males with peckers in excess of 12 inches should file
             under CAPITAL GAINS..


      If you are unsure of you correct category, please call our office and
      we will send out a Peter Meter Reader.



                                                Very Truly Yours,

                                                   Your Tax Woman
