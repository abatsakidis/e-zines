        Well first you'll need to know something about money, sports, and
        morons who you can make money off of!

STEP 1:  Put some money in the bank(under you're bed, whatever.)
STEP 2:  Pick a sport, maybe two or three.
STEP 3:  get a cool little book. (to keep all of you're notes in)
STEP 4:  Follow the sport for a few weeks to pick up on things, key players or
         whatever.
STEP 5:  Start an argument with someone about a upcoming game.(this will 
         get people to realize you'll take bets.)
STEP 6:  tell maybe a few people that you'll take the bets. Word will get
         around quick.
Step 7:  make bets, and keep 1/4 in a jar, incase there is a few major upsets.

                                HINTS!
                           ----------------
1.)  Make sure you're not dumb and bet with NARKS,COPS,TEACHERS,SNICHES!
2.)  Keep good records.
3.)  DON'T LOOK AXIOUS.  If they don't like you're spreads, then fuck'um, 
     they'll come back. 
4.)  Pay back you're debts SOON, it will make you look more Honest!?
5.)  Don't take double-or-nothing bets too much.  If you make someone
     owe you too much, you'll never get it.
6.)  A game helps many betmakers, here's what I used to use.
        NFL: pick 2 games, and the winners.
        if the player wins both, he gets 30$, 
        if the player wins 1, and loses 1, he owes 10$
        if the player loses 2, he owes 25$
     this is a trick I use, and it brings in allot, but if you change it, it
     could still work good.
