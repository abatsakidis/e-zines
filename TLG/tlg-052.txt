     I was looking through old files today, and came across some
   thing terribly alarming. A person, apparently in the new 
   breed of the h/p/a scene, made the statement; "You know only
   what your told." This implies that if the government doesn't
   want you to know something you wont know it. This is a false
   statement.

     There are two sides to every lie. If someone lies to you,
   i.e. the government, There is always someone who knows the 
   other side of it. An attitude such as this is totally unhealthy
   to the H/P/A scene. It takes HPA by the balls, and throws it 
   against a brick wall, spits on it and insults its mother.
   It's bullshit in the worst degree. 

     The point of hacking is to explore. A hacker explores what
   he is not supposed to know. You don't have to explore what
   is known, because to explore is to try and learn what is not
   known. 

     This does not only insult hacking, but it insults me. What I
   have learned in my years added all together is a weapon. A weapon
   powerful enough to be used against the government. As a young 
   child, I learned wilderness survival skills, And I mastered them.
   As a child I earned the NRA certified rank of Sharpshooter bar 4.
   This isn't the top rank, But it is high enough. As a teenager, I 
   learned more. I learned hacking. I learned hunting. I learned about
   chemistry. I learned of physics. I learned of my heritage. I learned
   martial arts of an unexpected kind. I learned to fight like a Viking.

     I can handle any weapon I touch with some degree of skill. Many 
   with a high degree of skill. I learned of love, and life. I learned
   of freedom, and oppression. But most importantly I learned about ME.
   Add all of it up, and everything else my life experiences taught me,
   and I am a fucking hell. Thats what I am. My skills don't end there.
   I can weld, I have a business sense, I know of metallurgy, mechanics,
   and much much more. The scary thing is I'm 17. What will I know when
   I'm 30?

     If something can be used against a government they do not want you
   to know about it. Plain and simple. No right minded leader would want
   it any other way. Ok! Ok! This is all too broad... Here, look...

     Nazi Germany oppressed the people in its reigns, right? The oppressors 
   would never ever want the oppressed to know what freedom is right? But
   yet a resistance was formed, right?

     I'm saying WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW, THEY CAN. Now, I know what your
   thinking. Your thinking the people of Nazi Germany had freedom before
   they lost it, well let me turn things our way. Thats right, Good old
   fuckhead  America. 

     We are oppressed. Americans (excluding American Indians) never once
   tasted freedom. Not once. The government does not want us to know of 
   true freedom. Where else in the world does freedom exist any more?
   I know ONE PLACE. The tribal heart land. The tribes of Africa to my
   knowledge have no restrictions and answer to no one. But that is off
   track, The point is, why would our resistance, our anti-American,
   pro-freedom, resistance want freedom, if that  statement holds true.
   IF WE ONLY KNEW WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED US TO KNOW, WE WOULDN'T
   KNOW FREEDOM.

     Now here is where I'm going to make an Abigwar first happen, I'm 
   going to admit something I would never ever admit before. A complete
   TRUE FREEDOM CAN NOT EXIST IN TODAYS SOCIETY. Granted, America has 
   more freedom than some countries, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO CALL OUR SELVES
   FREE.

     I have sworn my life to a cause. I swear I will never in the course
   of my life do anything to hinder the British release of Northern 
   Ireland, and will do anything in my power to help N. Ireland to 
   become a single republic with FREEDOM from any British rule. Maybe
   I'm a freedom fighter, But the freedom I talk of here is much different
   than what people see freedom as. 
   
     I write this file as a veteran of the H/P/A scene. I was there...
   I know what it is about. And I hail to the new breed of hackers,
   I truly do, But hacking like all scenes has become corrupted by
   capitalism, and with that always comes someone who knows it all 
   but yet nothing. Mulder, Rapid Dom., They caught the end of the 
   scene, The tail end... But right now, they are the local scenes
   only hope that I know of personally, and that I'll trust.

     It's kind of funny, As a skinhead, I look up to my older friends,
   Because they where there when I wasn't. As a hacker, I look down
   at this current breed, Because I was there, and they weren't. It's
   different now. It really is. I wish I still had the old ones around
   to look up to, Mr. Sandman, Mogel, all of them, But they are gone.
   You aren't. Don't let the scene be killed with an attitude that can
   only harm H/P/A/V/C!
