   In a land that once was free, reigned a foreign and evil government. An
 imperialistic band of bureaucrats stole this land from its people. They
 wrapped their greasy hands of imperialism around a whole country, and 
 tightened their grip. 
   
   From this oppressed land rose a great and mighty band of soldiers,
 determined to take back their country. They fought and died, while new
 soldiers rose from the broken land. In an effort of peace, a once great 
 man went to the imperialists and tried to cut a deal, but when he returned
 with a country that was divided in two, once again the  blood flowed in the 
 streets.
   
   Innocent men, women, and children from both sides of the conflict where 
 killed, and still are being killed. Bombs blew up in pubs and on the 
 streets while not to far away soldiers, raped, pillaged and  plundered
 private households and homesteads.

   On both sides, many great 'heros' arose. Heros of the imperialists where
 the ones who killed many innocent people, while heros of the oppressed where
 the ones who defended their land without running in fear. It is not hard to
 tell who the real terrorists are, is it? I do not support terrorism, however
 I will not condone the occupation of other peoples lands. Freedom NOT 
 Terrorism.

   America once broke away from the very same oppressors, and now 'proud and
 free' Americans have the nerve to look down upon these freedom fighters in
 disgust? As the rebels look to Americas history as inspiration, the Americans
 forget their history and spit on the rebels. This appalling, hypocritical 
 action can only be expected from the people in the United States.
   
   We as Americans have no right to be in this land just as they have no 
 right to be in another mans land. We became the one thing we hated the most, 
 We have lost that one thing that we take pride in the most. America does not 
 belong to us. Americans destroyed this country, Americans heritage comes from 
 our own homelands. Africa, Europe, Asia and so on. But the people who we 
 killed and destroyed for this land are now too few, and too minute to give 
 it back to. The Irish are still alive, Still fighting, and the British 
 should be forced out. The fighters that follow in our footsteps need help,
 But most of the people in this land wouldn't lend the Irish a cup of sugar
 if the needed it. Stop the Hypocrisy.
