       Psilocybin is the active substance contained in the body of the
  Psilocybe mexicana mushroom. Psilocybin is a hallucinogen, which is
  considered 100 times less potent than LSD. The use of Psilocybin is 
  illegal within the United States. Included in the hallucinogen drug 
  category are LSD and mescaline. Mescaline is extracted from the cactus 
  peyote.  Most hallucinogens are regarded as much more potent than 
  Marijuana.

       All natural hallucinogens are regarded as relatively safe,
   with damage being caused after MUCH chronic abuse. It has been shown 
   that the use of drugs, such as the mushroom do not have psychological or
   medical effects when used as part of a culture, or religion. It has not 
   been proven otherwise, that the effects of "normal" (as in pure, not 
   laced) hallucinogens, in which they alter the chemical composition of 
   the brain, to be irreversable.

       When the drug has been ingested, by what ever means appropriate, 
   It takes effect on the mind by altering the chemical "balance" of the 
   mind. Thus causing hallucinations, feelings of extreme well being, 
   often referred to as "Euphoria" by drug researchers. 

      As the person is more intoxicated, they will most likely have
   increased and more "interesting" perceptions, sensations, and mental
   feelings. After some time into the "trip", the user will experience some
   amounts of altered perceptions, and changed views of reality. The 
   emotional state of the person will almost always be amplified, Placing 
   the user at risk, if previously being depressed.
   
      Feelings of paranoia, terror, and being scared are quite
   common with bad trips. However, The more common Euphoria, can be 
   accompanied with feelings of divine power. Mushrooms, which have been 
   used ethnically for an unestimatable time, are some times referred to 
   as the "Flesh of the Gods" because the psilocybin often make people feel 
   as though they where with or being talked to by the gods.

       Indian tribes in North America and Mexico have been documented 
   back to the 16th century for the use of psilocybin. Also, Nordic
   warriors including the vikings, have been said to use the mushroom's 
   "magic" power to bring them to a battle plane called "beserker", where 
   they would do battle with other mighty warriors and gods in their minds, 
   to gain practice for the time called "Ragnorok". The Twilight of the Gods, 
   as it is often referred to because it is said that the sun will grow dim, 
   to a point of twilight, and then all evil must battle all good. 

       Their are many species of psychoactive mushrooms. The most
   common is "Liberty Caps" which are about 2-4 inches tall. One of the
   first known to be psychoactive was the Fly Agaric, a large colorful
   mushroom. The prices now days are expensive because mushrooms are not 
   that common any more. The price is usually about $30 for a 1/8th of an 
   ounce. This is enough for 1 person to "trip", and for 2 people (splitting 
   it in equal portions) to have slight hallucinations, including the
   visualization of "trails".

       It has been a major theory that anything used in moderation
   that can be controlled is safe. One major draw back from this is that the
   people some times get more than they bargained for. A lot of drugs these
   days have been "laced" or mixed with PCP. PCP is a drug that CAN alter the
   mind with irreversible effects. Also, its effects the way the drug it is
   combined with works. Often PCP causes an extreme headache after the peak
   of the high, and can "Burn out" people much more than other softer drugs.  

      PCP is cheap to make and can be sprayed or dusted onto the
   drug that is being laced with. Users often don't know that the drug they
   are using has been laced, until they feel the strange effects. First time
   users may regard the bad experience as a bad trip, not realizing what
   was wrong  with it.

      This is the main threat to the drug users, next to the law.
   PCP is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Undetectable to be more
   exact. PCP causes fits of extreme rage with or with out being provoked.
   Finally, it is important to remember that drug use, and abuse are two
   different things, although they are both illegal.
