What's a pull down menu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a pull down menu is a menu that you use the arrow keys to move the cursor 
around and select your option. Although Pull down menus are a nice touch 
to any BBs, don't go crazy with them. Don't make every menu a pull down,
that gets annoying real fast.

	best places to use them:
		oneliners; feedback; conference selections; new scans; 
		goodbye; any other yes/no type commands you have sitting
		around.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So.. how do we make these things?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Its really easy to make a simple one, and a complex one can make ya lose all
your hair.

so.. for this I'm gonna show you a simple one, a feed back menu, to get
you started.

okay first go to Thedraw and draw your ANSI... something like this:

			Leave the SoP mail?

				
				
of course yours will be MUCH more interesting than the one that I have here...

then hit alt+j and select op animation method.

then make it look like this:
		
			Leave the SoP mail?

			       |01%01
			       |02%02

make sure they are in the |01 and |02 are in different colors than the %01 and
%02, else it won't work. save the file as feedback.ans with the spped set to
the fastest there is(I believe thats 0) in your textfile directory.

now go into Obv and go to the menu editor. and change the feed menu. in the
pulldown file(option G) put in feedback.ans. and leave the other fields blank.

push H to change your options, and add 6 options then change the first one.
fill in the blanks as shown below.

a: YES                          - option name
b: (leave blank)                        
c: no
d: -L                           - clears the screen
e: Y
f: (leave blank)
g: 1                            - sets the pulldown to 1(|01 and %01)

hit ] to goto the next menu

a: 
b:
c: no
d: es
e: Y
f: 1
g: 0

this command is "stacked" meaning that it comes after a previous command 
that has the same keys to execute it... thats why there is a 0 instead of 1
in the pulldown id... the first command in a stack is the only one that
gets the pulldown id number.

hit ] to goto the next option

a: 
b:
c: no
d: -L
e: Y
f:
g: 0

all this command does is clear the screen, so that when the user gets sent 
back to the main menu after leaving mail, the screen will not be a different 
color... obv does this sometimes after a pull down menu. 

hit ] to goto the next option

a:
b:
c: no
d: -/
e: Y
f:
g:

this send the user back to the menu which the command was launched from.

hit ] to goo the next option

a: NO
b:
c: no
d: -L
e: *
g: 2

this is the second option in the pulldown menu(hence the 2 in the id slot),
this clears the screen before sending them back to the main menu.       

hit ] to goo the next menu

a:
b:
c: no
d: -\
e: *
f:
g: 0

send `em back...

after the first option names(option a:) which is either set to yes or no, 
it doesn't matter what the hell you put in them, most of mine still say
new option... the first one is the one that counts.

after that just make sure everything is in the right spots...(it should be)
and that the main menu calls the feed menu for the feedback option.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So.. if I want to see some good pull down... where do I call?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why the AirWayS BBs of course...
