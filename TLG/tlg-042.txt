   I left, and now I regret it. I have been away from the hacker scene
 for a long time now. At least what was left of the hacker scene. I 
 looked back, tonight, at some of my old writing. Maybe I did it for
 inspiration in my life, or maybe just out of boredom, but the point is
 that I did.

   Once upon a time long ago.. or maybe not so long ago, I wrote that when
 something as powerful as a hacker is in your past, that it will forever
 be in your present. I was right. When all is lost, all is gone, and 
 you have nothing in your life their is one thing that will always be with
 you... And thats your past. 
 
   Let me explain what past is to me. The past is something that you can
 always fall back on. If something goes wrong, you can always backtrack.
 Not to be too redundant but here is an example; If you get a job doing
 masonry work and you get good at it, but you leave that skill for a 
 higher paying job like welding, and the welding doesn't work out, you'll
 always have your masonry skills.

   No one can take your past away from you. A wise man, David Wynder once
 told me, "...They always want to take something from you. Your house, your
 money, your freedom. And then they look at you thinking they have you beat.
 But you tell them loud and powerfully, I WANT TO DIE IN COMBAT, I WANT TO
 GO TO VALHALLA. And all they can say is FUCK, HOW CAN WE TAKE THAT FROM HIM!"
 
   Now, that wont apply so much to most of you. Thats more of a 
 skinhead/odinist thing, but your past is the same. I always used to say
 never to look back, keep going strong. But every thing and every one has
 a breaking point. It takes a man to stand up and wait things out, but
 it takes a smart man to take a look at the situation and say "This is what
 I'll do. I'll back up on that and then excel past." Now I don't know if
 you can visualize that. I don't know if you even want to, but what I'm 
 saying is this.
                        
                        W
                        A
                  A  B  L  C         
                        L        
                              
  
   Your at point B. You started at point A. You want to be at point C,
 which is a straight line from A to C, but their is a wall conveniently
 placed between B and C. So you back up to A, and find a different rout
 to C.

   I feel like I'm writing a math test. But anyway the point of the story
 is ALWAYS remember where you come from, and what you've done. ALWAYS.
=============================================================================

    One last thing. I would like to thank the new breed of hackers. Without
    you, ALL WOULD BE LOST. You are the truth. You know who you are.

Keep the faith, 
Abigwar
