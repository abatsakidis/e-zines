*** NOTICE ***
All misspellings and attributions to the wrong person are in
fact on purpose. This supposedly adds another layer of humor
to the humor packet switching system, or HPSS. Please note
that this issue is so highly offensive that I will personally
rm it after passing out copies at my local chapter of "The
Church of Scientology".

Now on with the show!            (special thanks to otopico@dto.net)
