Introduction


Greetings, from Starbuilders! The Earth consciousness sure is shifting!

We have entered a new cycle here at Starbuilders. It is to build
multidimensional structures. In practical terms, we are incorporating
fifth-dimensional principles into new business ventures. 

In the past, we had never cared to make much money. What would we do with
the money? Upgrade our computer? Buy more clay for Malchora's ceramics, or
more massage oil for Emmanuel's work? The needs of our "Mission Bubble" -
the parameters of our Mission - were fulfilled; the universe was providing
everything. 

Spirit, however, has presented us with an exciting new vision. It is to
begin establishing businesses. (In the past, this would not have been
exciting for us, just commercial.)

The jobs we are creating offer Lightworkers opportunities in which they
can (1) follow their spirit without hesitation, (2) remain in their
integrity, (3) expand and embody their experience of living in eternity
("There is nowhere to go, nothing to do, except your next step, as
directed by spirit"), (4) live, work, and be treated as a master (Divine
being, or however you define your higher self), (5) serve others, and of
course, (5) make money. 

Many of us know these principles, at least intellectually, and have
integrated them into our lives to some extent. The focus of these business
experiments is to ground these principles into practical, materialistic
reality. This will show that they work. For many who are still searching
for their Right Livelihood, this could be a step in that direction. 

We are grounding our relationships into the concrete world of business.
From a fifth-dimensional perspective, this creates a solid network for the
Force of Evolution to use. Our work is the hub of our association. 

In these ventures, please remember that we are not your "boss." We already
have had to deal with people's "boss" issues. We are masters organizing on
a business level. 

The articles that follow describe some of the changes we have gone through
and that have lead to this Vision. We hope you enjoy. 
 
In Oneness  
The Starbuilders Team.

Directions of Consciousness

In the West, tradition teaches us that consciousness moves in one of two
directions - upward or downward. Eastern traditions include the directions
of no movement and omnipresence. What follows is an extraterrestrial
model. Like all models (and traditions ), it is a *picture* of How It Is -
a sketch. It is not reality itself. In this model, there are five classes
of movement. Try viewing each class not as superior or inferior to one
another, but rather as ways in which spirit interacts with the planetary
consciousness. Each class has its own pleasures, insights, and adventures.
 
	When you are exploring a certain class, do not expect those who
are exploring other classes to understand what you experience. It may not
be real for them.  There is no blame for exploring any of these classes,
but attachment to any class is suffering. Resistance to any one is
illusion. Spirit and the Force of Evolution are at work in all classes.
None of them are "The Right Way" or "The Wrong Way" to live.  The five
directions of movement are (1) Horizontal, (2) Upward, (3) Parallel, (4)
Downward, and (5) Transcendental. It is possible to shift from one
modality to another in an instant, although we also may move into them
gradually. 


(1) Horizontal Movement
  
Horizontal Movement (HM) is how most beings on the planet currently
operate. The planetary consciousness, however, is phasing out this
possibility. It is becoming harder to live this way. 

*Behavior*

When we are in HM, we are unconsciously living out patterns of the
planetary consciousness. It is strictly a time/space reality. The planet
embeds these patterns in our genetic structure. They include the animal
instincts - survival, mating, territorialit y, and pecking order - plus
the need to know "How It Is." This last instinct, the need to know, is a
real human need. When someone challenges our picture of "How It Is," we
may fight to defend it. "What can I get [or do] next?" is an example of
the HM mindscape (a promotion, a better car, new clothes, a new conquest).
	
	It is the search for "more and better." We try to look and act our
best to get linear rewards, and, at times, feel as if we are on a
treadmill. Since linear goals are our prime focus, there is little time to
invest in spiritual realities. We are usually very active when exploring
this class, with much to achieve, many good causes, aspirations, and noble
hopes. 

*Free Will*

As we act out planetary programs, are we any different from other species?
A cheetah charges a herd of bison. At some point, she singles out one of
them and chases him down. Is this Free Will? To an extent, it is: She has
made a choice. A human sits down at a restaurant. Pondering the menu, he
thinks, "Do I want a t-bone steak or a tofu burger?" Is this Free Will? To
an extent, it is. 

	Let us distinguish between two kinds of free will: "free will"
represents choosing between two or more options that our instincts present
to us. "Free Will" represents our ability to act beyond the parameters of
planetary programming. In this context, the preceding examples show the
use of "free will." 

	Stated another way, the choices that the planet offers us are
fruits from the same tree. She drives us to seek pleasure or to avoid
pain. We exercise a linear version of Free Will as we try to enhance our
chances for survival, mating, power, pleasure, or pain avoidance. At this
level of participation, our decisions seem very important: free will is
real. This contributes to the irony: when we use Free Will the least, we
defend it most vehemently. 

*Self-Help* 

If our strategies for dealing with life are dysfunctional (we are not
getting what we want), we may seek the services of an HM professional.
They will teach us instinct enhancement strategies, which may relieve some
degree of suffering. 

*Defining Reality*

While in HM, we label all of our experiences, whether positive or
negative, as real. Bad is bad, good is good, all is real. We think reality
is objective and etched in stone. 

	We consider only information that we receive through the five
senses (although "hunches" are sometimes used) as real. The mindstream is
the major source of information. 


(2) Upward Movement


More and more beings are practicing Upward Movement (UM). The planetary
consciousness will drop this modality after the ascension. To picture the
relationship between our conscious intent and our "stuff" (imperfections,
blocks, karma, etc.) in UM, make a "T" with your hands, like the "Time
Out" signal made by the referees in a football game. (For those who are
sports deficient, place your right hand in front of your chest, palm
facing left, fingers extended upwards. Lay the palm of your left hand on
top of the finger tips of your right hand, making the "T.") The right hand
represents our intent of upward movement (ascension), while t he left hand
represents our stuff blocking our way. 

*Behavior*

When we explore UM, we are unconsciously participating with the astral
aspect of the Earth's consciousness. We gain a sense of moral right and
wrong and do our best to rid ourselves of the wrong. At times, we can find
ourselves on the "I've-got-to-get-myself-together [spiritually]"
treadmill. We send our good works upward, hoping that God will acknowledge
them and reward us in some way. 

	As in HM, we hold a tight grip on our definition of How It Is. We
may fight (or resent) others who contradict our hard-earned picture of
reality. In UM, we perceive ourselves as "different" from those in HM. We
may see ourselves as special. While this distinction adds to our sense of
identity, it also separates us from the HM masses.  

	We often display much good will, dedication, devotion, and love
when we move in this way. Most of us have a heart-felt desire to serve
God, humanity, our higher self, or the mission. We want to do good. 

*Free Will*

Free Will seems very important, because we perceive it as a choice between
good and evil. If it did not exist, how could we measure our progress? How
could we define sin, or know how to act? 

	We are still acting on astral information provided by the
planetary consciousness. Is choosing between two planetary options (good
or evil) considered Free Will, or is it a sign of a spiritual agreement to
participate in a planetary drama on an astral level? 

*Self-Help*

In UM, we try to clean out our chakras, release suffering from past lives,
and get information from psychics or channeled entities. Feelings of
unworthiness, of guilt, or of our inability to serve the mission more
effectively can be a source of much suffe ring. 

	We view the position of our consciousness as below our stuff,
pushing upward. Our goal is to push up through the stuff to become a
better person. We need to be worthy of ascending (or becoming
enlightened). We work very hard at it, trying, at times, to fix others as
well. 
	
As a result of our struggle, we often find it difficult to accept the
notion of an unconditional ascension. We are working hard for liberation.
Why should God save others who are lazy or are downright evil? (The
others, too, are suffering. They are working in the only way that they
can.)

	When we explore UM, we can become psychically weary, because this
stage feels like it goes on forever. 

*Defining Reality*

The planetary consciousness provides us with another means of veiling
ourselves: dogma - word structures mistaken for reality. In UM, dogma,
mixed with belief and experience, defines our reality. Since UM implies
movement "towards God," it is vital that we find the right dogma that we
can use to guide our actions. When we participate with the planetary
consciousness in UM, we do not believe in illusions. There is only one
reality for us: whatever conforms to our world view, we define as right,
whatever do es not conform is wrong. 

	We fear and fight the Dark Forces in UM. To gain support for our
cause, we may use them to frighten, er, alert others to this threat. In
some cases, we might even "quote God" to coerce others to behave like we
believe they should: "If you are a male and h ave long hair, you will burn
in Hell for eternity. God hates men with long hair." (This is real. I did
not make it up.) This is *fear sharing* and can be contagious. 

	In UM consciousness, we need to be right and do good. Attachment
to either, however, creates polarity. The universe rearranges itself to
accommodate our picture of reality. If we must do good and be right, we
imply that something is bad and wrong. Thus, we simultaneously co-create
stuff to work through. Because of the dual nature of UM, there is no way
that we can live in the state of "doing it right." Therefore, we guarantee
suffering by moving this way. 


(3) Parallel Movement

Parallel Movement (PM) differs radically from HM and UM, because it
recognizes the possibility of illusion. 

*Behavior*

When we are in PM, we classify our experiences differently. Instead of
judging them as right or wrong (as in UM), or asking ourselves, "is this
the best strategy?" (as in HM), we define our experiences as either real
or illusion. Just because we perceive something with our Earth body's
perceptual mechanisms is no guarantee that it is real. 

	What criteria do we use to determine if something is real? We use
our vision of Heaven on Earth. If an event is something that we would call
heavenly, then it is real. If it is less than heavenly, then it is an
hallucination. As the universe rearranges it self to accommodate our
picture of *reality* (as opposed to illusion), we manifest portions of
Heaven on Earth through our selections. 

*Free Will*

This is the first level at which we exercise Free Will. We are labeling
experiences as real or unreal based on our spiritual vision, not our
animal instincts. 

*Self-Help*

The goal is to separate illusion from reality. There are many
fifth-dimensional technologies dedicated to this end. 

*Defining Reality*

We define reality, in part, by labeling negative experiences "illusions."
When viewed from other modalities, however, this can appear as a form of
denial. Ironically, it is actually an affirmation exercise. Here we use
the universal principle that says "Whatever you are fascinated with, you
get more of." We are fascinated with the real and we accent it. We
acknowledge illusions as such and ignore them (or deal with them quickly).
This is another means of manifesting our Divine Vision. 

	As in UM and HM, we know that suppressing our emotions is harmful.
In PM, however, we extend this understanding to include our thoughts.
Thought suppression - even the suppression of negative thoughts - is
viewed as harmful. The universe does not rearrange itself to accommodate
our thoughts per se, but, to an extent, what we think is real. If we
suppress them, we imply that they are dangerous and, therefore, real.
Instead, we view negative thoughts as simply illusions. They pass through
us easily. 

	When in PM, we define the struggles associated with HM and UM as
hallucinations. 


(4) Downward Movement

The term Downward Movement (DM) may give the impression of lowering one's
awareness. In this model, however, it describes the grounding of spiritual
awareness into the body. 

	To picture the relationship between our conscious intent and our
stuff, make an inverted "T" with your hands. (An upside-down version of
the "T" used in DM.) The hand that is pointing downward represents the
movement of our consciousness, the horizontal h and represents our stuff.
In DM, we engage with it voluntarily, but it does not trap or cover us. 

*Behavior*

When we explore DM, we realize that being right does not serve our
mission. Doing good does not necessarily serve. To be "New Age Correct" is
not a motivation for action or inaction. Allowance and awareness are our
friends. We are direct and deliberate.  Do we interact with the planetary
consciousness? Yes and No. Yes, in the sense that we engage with it; No,
in that we base our actions on information from our spirit (instead of the
planetary consciousness). The Watcher is at the forefront of our
consciousness. There is nowhere to go and nothing to do (except to take
the next step that spirit directs us to take). 

*Free Will*

In DM, we observe planetary imperatives pushing us in certain directions.
It is love, however, that is the deciding factor for our actions. We move
smoothly. We use Free Will to love or not to love. For example, say
someone insults you. Instead of automatically defending yourself, you are
in a position where you can look at the situation rather objectively. You
need not hide your feelings, but, instead, express your wisdom. (Wisdom is
a Divine, living art. It is a masterful blending of Divine and planetary
consciousnesses. Its expression is an illuminating form of love.)

	The notion of using Free Will to love or not to love is
paradoxical. If we choose not to love, we instantly leave DM. (Not to love
means we are acting unconsciously and, therefore, are incapable of
exercising Free Will.) If, however, our consciousness is anchored in DM,
we can watch ourselves, in a detached way, moving in UM, PM, or HM. That
is the paradox: we leave DM, yet we stay. We note the momentary shift. On
the other hand, if we begin struggling to get back into DM, we are, in
effect, practicing UM. 

	A question: If our true identity is spirit, and spirit *always*
follows the dictates of God (or The All That Is), can Free Will be
anything other than illusion? 

*Self-Help*

We do not struggle to move through our stuff, nor label it real or unreal.
Instead, we are open and investigate it. Sometimes, we use technologies,
not because we yearn to blast through the negativity, but because spirit
directs. 

	Suffering still exists. As long as we are in human bodies, we must
suffer. Our relationship to pain and imperfection, though, has changed. We
are not trying to push ourselves upward through it. Instead, it is below
us. We are situated above it (and this applies to our self-image, as
well). Pushing is unnecessary. 

*Defining Reality*

Everything is (relatively) real, even hallucinations. We observe, "Oh,
that is real for their mental, emotional, physical, or spiritual bodies."
It is okay. The line that separates the various forms of movement grows
very thin. 

	Trusting in the Divine nature of the universe, we embrace our
experiences. We interact to see what happens. The Great Mystery deepens.
Life and the Divine Plan unfold in ways in which we cannot anticipate. We
accept that and are willing participants. Some times we play the Fool, the
Normal, the Bad Guy, the Hero, the Wrong One. We do not judge ourselves.
As servants of The Force of Evolution, we just do it. 


(5) Transcendent Movement

Transcendent Movement is no movement at all and is omnipresence. The more
that we say about this class, the less accurate the description will be.
It is a paradoxical way of life. 

*Behavior*

We give the planetary consciousness 100% free reign. We give the Divine
consciousness 100% free reign. The two become one. (1+1=1) There is
nowhere to go and nothing to do. 

*Free Will*

"Free Will is like a free lunch." 

*Self-Help* 

Not applicable. 

*Defining Reality*

Truth is not words. It is something that we can experience as an
intrinsic, living Force.  

	We are here. 


Conclusion

Each of these classes of movement offers us unique ways to explore our
dreams and visions and to manifest beautiful (or not so beautiful) forms.
The awe-inspiring cathedrals, for example, are by-products of exploring
UM. 

	No matter what class of movement you find yourself exploring,
remember that you are in the hands of your spirit, as is everyone. And
regardless of any perceived shortcomings, the Creator of the Universe, as
well as the universe itself, loves us unconditio nally.  ***

Checking Your OQ (Oneness Quotent)

When we embody a fifth-dimensional perspective, we are at One with
everything. Being in a human body, however, does not support this state.
The six senses engulf our consciousness in a deluge of differences. 

	This article defines various ways in which we separate ourselves
from others. It also outlines a simple yet effective method for observing,
analyzing, and ultimately shifting our relationship to our alienating
reactions. 


Structures of Separation
 
Our emotional, mental, and physical bodies each function in ways that
separate us from the universe. The physical body has an undeniable sense
of "I" and "you." The mental body works in a linear fashion. It constructs
pictures of reality by using distinct ions. The emotional body is
personal, as opposed to transpersonal, and usually only knows how "I"
feel. More developed emotional bodies can tune in to the feelings of
others (empathy). Yet, they will still perceive the other as "other." 

	Additionally, most human social structures divide humanity.
Religious, political, monetary, class, philosophical, and nationalistic
systems superficially link beings together in groups, but separate the
groups from the whole.  

	The planetary consciousness further adds to the division by
endowing its inhabitants with programmable genetic codes. These trigger
feelings of separation automatically, whenever we are in the presence of
those who fit into the "enemy" group. (Irish vs English, Israelis vs
Arabs, etc.)

	Other planetary-induced prejudices involve survival, sexual,
hierarchial, and territorial codings. Plus, there are interplanetary
issues - astrological biases - that we must contend with. Let us call
these perceived distinctions "prejudices." We will include "preferences,"
"biases," and "isms" under that name. 

	When circumstances activate a prejudice, our relationship to our
prejudices will determine whether or not we will leave the Oneness zone.
For example, we naturally discern physical features. If an adult is, say,
three-and-a-half feet tall, we can say he i s short. If we reject the
person for this, then we have left the Oneness zone. Yet, if we simply
discern this relative feature rather than judge it, then we do not leave. 

	If we embody the understanding that prejudices are *relative,*
then we do not throw others out of our Oneness space when circumstances
activate them. Conversely, if we experience our prejudices as *absolute,*
then we will indeed suffer. *Though it feels like we are throwing others
out of our Oneness zone, we are actually throwing out ourselves.* We hurt
ourselves more than our target. 

	Labeling someone - including ourselves - "too tall" (or "too"
anything) implies rejection. It reveals an embedded cultural or planetary
prejudice. Usually, when we reject someone, there is an accompanying
emotional, physical, and mental reaction. The good news is that these
reactions never reflect the opinions of our spiritual body. 


Oneness - The Ideal

Most spiritually-oriented beings intuitively know the value of being at
One with the universe. Peace, harmony, love, and ecstasy are but a few of
the joys of this transcendental state. Some beings, however, use the ideal
of Oneness like a whip: they beat themselves if they do not live up to
their ideal. The ideal becomes the proverbial carrot that they can never
reach. 

	On the other hand, we can pretend that we already *are* in the
Oneness state. This delusion helps reduce the pain of separation. But to
transcend the illusion of separation we must first see how we really
relate to our prejudices.
	
	Before we delve into this technique for shifting our relationship
to separation, we will first explore a model that classifies this kind of
alienating behavior. 


Categories of Separation 

In this model, there are two categories of prejudices -
Physical/Psychological (a two-in-one category), and Interactive. The
Physical side of the Physical/Psychological category is the most simple to
grasp. We reject others because of their physical appea rance (which is
relative). For example, we can judge others who are too short, fat, dark,
ugly, old, or "too" anything. This includes the opposites of the
attributes just mentioned. 

	On the Psychological side of this category, we assess behavior.
(All behavior is relative.) Is that person too angry, happy, artificial,
dry, or plain gullible, slow, or clumsy? (Again, the opposites apply
equally.)
	
	The Interactive category is the most nebulous. We reject others
based on demands that are usually unconscious. For instance, "I am angry
at Shirley! She was supposed to call me last night, but she didn't!" In
this example, the fact is that Shirley forgot to call. The hidden demand
is that she must live up to her word. Therefore, I have cast myself from
the Garden of Oneness. 


Guidelines for Using The Technique 

The technique that follows helps to expand one's vision. If spirit draws
you to experiment with it, use it gently, like a meditation of love and
acceptance. Do not bother to strain your brain; it is neither a mental
exercise nor a test. 

	The important points are (1) your intent to see, and (2) the
application of the technique. That is all. It is not about forcing
yourself to change, or even to increase your OQ. If you find yourself
doing this, be aware that you are beating yourself. You will be exploring
Upward Movement. 

	We reject different traits with different intensity. Some traits
are easy to transcend, others are difficult. Practice, however, shifts our
perception about them. This technique works because of the universal
principle, "Anything that you focus your attention on will change." (The
amount that something will change is relative to the degree of attention
we focus on it. The degrees of attention range from various kinds of
unconsciousness to the many varieties of wakefulness.) When we expose
something to the light of awareness, it must change. This is enough. 


Processing Prejudices

Use this four-step technique for processing both Physical/Psychological
and Interactive prejudices. 

Step One: Recognition

When you are around other beings, watch your thoughts and feelings. First,
notice that a prejudice has been activated. You are in separation. You
throw someone out of your heart because they do (or they are) something
that you do not like. Without this recognition, you are behaving
unconsciously. 

Step Two: Recounting the Incident with the Hidden Demand or Expectation 

After recognition, identify precisely why you are doing this. You leave
Oneness because you have a hidden demand that the other did not meet. 

	For Physical/Psychologic prejudices, you say, "I reject you
because you are ___ [e.g., too young] ____" (or too radical, Angolian,
skinny, etc.). Be as precise as possible. Next, search for the hidden
demand. Ask, "Why would I reject you for ___ [being too young] ____?" You
might answer, "You are too irresponsible. I demand others be responsible."
So, restate your prejudice, using the hidden demand: "I reject you,
because you are irresponsible." 

	For Interactive separations, you must *be aware of the order in
which the events unfolded.* Say, for example, Tom dropped and broke your
favorite Ming vase. You are absolutely furious. No way can you stay in the
Oneness space. So, state your feelings cle arly: "I am mad as hell at you!
You broke my vase!" (To be most effective, verbally share your sentiments
with Tom. If you need justification, say you are doing a spiritual
exercise.) Usually, we put our emotions first ("I'm mad..."), before the
action th at triggered it. Chronologically, however, emotional reactions
*follow* the incident. So, for accuracy, you would restate the events in
the order in which they occurred: "You broke my vase! I am angry at you!" 

	Next, search for the hidden demand. In our example, it is "do not
destroy my possessions." So, restate the prejudice again: "You broke my
vase. I reject anyone who destroys my belongings. I am angry." Emotional
reactions are the result of someone (or some thing) not living up to our
hidden demands or expectations. You may notice that once you expose the
hidden demand, the interaction becomes transpersonal. It is not about Tom,
but anyone who destroys your belongings. 

Notes on Hidden Demands and Expectations

Hidden demands imply complete pictures of reality. For example, human
beings naturally want their possessions preserved. There is no fault in
that. Yet, this may imply attachment. If we were only human beings, then
we could say no more. 

	Our humanity, however, is only a very small part of our wholeness.
In our expanded identities, we do not attach ourselves to objects,
feelings, or pictures of reality. We are at One with everything. In this
light, the hidden demand "do not destroy my poss essions" reveals aspects
of a third- and fourth-dimensional lifestyle. 

	Many times, we believe that particular incidents - the forms -
reveal our real demands. In reality, we layer incidents over (and mistake
them for) our real demands. That is why we call them hidden: we mistake
the form for the demand. For example, say some one has lied to you. You
say, "I reject you because you lied to me." You then search for the hidden
demand and find, "I demand honesty." This, however, does not feel like the
root demand. So, you go deeper. You discover that you cannot control those
who lie. The root demand would then be, "I reject you, because I cannot
control you when you lie." 

Step Three: The Question

After you have noted and exposed your hidden demand, ask, "Can I be at One
with someone who ___ [hidden demand] ___?" (e.g., "destroys my
possessions.")

Step Four: The Answer

Lastly, answer the question. There are two possible answers: either you
can be at One or you cannot. If the answer is Yes, you will know it to be
true. If the answer is No, simply make a note of it and continue with your
life. 

	Whatever your answer, stay with the feeling for a minute or so.
This allows the emotional and physical bodies to "grok" the experience. 


Notes On Processing Prejudices

For those accustomed to severe or intense disciplines, this exercise may
sound impotent. Yet, some beings can experience it as a powerful tool for
exploring their wholeness. Its power lies in the universal principle,
"Anything that you focus your attention on will change." However, the
technique takes a considerable amount of concentration to follow through. 

	It may surprise you when you find a prejudice that you want to
keep. This is a normal symptom of attachment. Just note it, feel it, and
go on with your life. 

	Another view: Some beings may believe that this approach could
weaken one's personal power. In many instances, however, we unknowingly
derive personal power from the Dark Forces. Any time that we try to bend
someone to our will or liking is an act of dark ness. On the other hand,
surrendering to Oneness increases our access to the Solar Force - the
Light of our Truth within. When we express this Force, we have done our
best and need do no more. 


Summary

There are four steps in processing prejudices.
 
First, be aware that you have rejected someone - that you are out of the
Oneness space. 

Second, define the hidden demand or expectation: "I reject you because
_______." (For Interactive separations, order the events chronologically). 

Third, ask, "Can I be at One with someone who __ [hidden demand] __?" 

Fourth, answer Yes or No. Stay with the feeling for a moment. 

After a little practice, the four steps amalgamate, making the process
very smooth and easy. 


Epilogue

Why do I use this exercise? I use it because spirit dropped it into my
lap. I think, "Earth will unconditionally ascend. Oneness will not be an
issue on Ascended Earth; it will be a given. Am I just experimenting with
humanity's struggle with Oneness? Or am I becoming a living embodiment of
the principles and energies of the Unconditional Ascension?" If the latter
is true, then the question I need ask is not "*Can* I be at One with
someone who ______." More to the point is, "*Will* I be at One with
everyone." 

	Of course, I may simply be hallucinating. Nevertheless, as I live
the Great Mystery, I realize that I can only act within the limits of what
I receive and live my vision in integrity.  ***

Embodying The Unconditional Ascension

We are here to live miraculous lives. This is the most that we can do to
serve the Force of Evolution. Like a dress rehearsal for living in the New
Civilization, we act according to the principles of ascended Earth. 

	In this process, we see everyone as saved. This requires that we
surrender judgment and forgive ourselves. As we do this, we embody aspects
of our Divine self, and our other-dimensional Light expands into the third
dimension. 

	To embody something means that a particular trait, energy, or
perspective becomes integrated into our Ground Crew - the emotional,
physical, and mental bodies. Whether or not the Ascension happens, this
process invites Divine Love to merge with the Ground Crew. This, in
itself, is enough motivation for any spiritual undertaking. 


Elements of The Ascension

We may embody Oneness, Eternity, Divine Direction, Allowance, Divine
Identity, Faith, Immortality, Divine Support, Presence, and Integrity, to
name a few. 

Oneness: Differences never separate us. We relate to differences with
detachment. 

Eternity: "There is nowhere to go and nothing to do [except the next step,
as directed by spirit]." Ascended Earth is timeless. There is never a need
to rush or push. 

Divine Direction: Because we respond spontaneously to the direction of
spirit, our actions are in harmony with the Divine Will. 

Allowance: Allowance is natural respect for other beings and their
expressions. 

Divine Identity: We are masters, angels, or other cosmic beings,
co-creating a miraculous civilization. 

Faith: We cannot and need not know everything. Yet, we have faith that the
universe is unfolding exactly as it should, in its cosmic sequence. We do
not doubt. 

Immortality: As children of God, we know immortality. All forms change,
and at the time of the Final Ascension, all must vanish into the Formless.
Our spirit, however, which is beyond form, always *is.*

Divine Support: We know that wherever we go, into whatever dimension, the
universe always supports our work. 

Presence: We are tuned in to the moment, the Eternal Now. We remain
current and alive in our thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations and
perceptions. 

Integrity: Integrity ("The Internal Hound of Truth") means acting upon
information that we know in our hearts to be true. There is no blame. 


Results/Implications  

As we enter this process of embodiment, we begin to mutate. Rigid internal
structures start to collapse. They cannot remain stable in such expansive
energetic atmospheres, because the "negative pressure" created by the
newly embodied state causes them to explode. 

We become living examples of the Unconditional Ascension, cutting pathways
in the direction of this Event. Our ever increasing vibration moves us and
the planet towards that reality. The Force of Evolution paves the road
through us. It manifests circumsta nces, perceptions, and relationships
that support that Event. 

We are Starseeds. Plant us (in the energetic soil of a planet soon to
ascend) and watch us grow. We embody the Ascension and shine. Eventually,
our Ground Crews, along with the Earth's body, burst into Light,
fulfilling our Mission. We are microcosms of t he future Earth Star.  ***

Varieties of Ascension

There are three popular Ascension stories in circulation today - Personal,
Group, and Planetary. How we relate to the Ascension can reveal many of
our unspoken desires, beliefs, and fears. 


Personal Ascension

A Personal Ascension is an event in which an individual shifts from a
dense physical body to an immortal Light body. (Materialistic versions do
not include transforming into a Light body; rather, they envision having
an eternally healthy physical body.) Here are two example of Personal
Ascensions. 

	Perhaps the most publicized Personal Ascension is that of Jesus of
Nazareth. According to the Christian Scriptures, after He died, his body
disappeared from the tomb. He descended into Hell - the darkest realm of
the fourth dimension (astral plane) - for two days. He then returned in
His luminous Light body. After visiting his disciples, He ascended into
Heaven. 

	The Hindus do not reserve Personal Ascension exclusively for their
deities. They know that many perfected yogis have ascended. When this
happens, the light/life force leaves the body, and the physical body
either disappears or turns to ashes. Today, Personal Ascension is a very
popular goal. For many, it is an attractive release from suffering. It is
the preferred alternative to dying. If this is our motive for Ascending,
then our work may lack the force, conviction, and clarity needed to supp
ort the planetary project effectively, though it will serve at some level. 

	With the above in mind, we may deduce three motives for Personal
Ascension: To (1) break free from the anguish of Earth hell
(third-dimensional), (2) escape from the wheel of karma
(fourth-dimensional), or (3) serve The All That Is in a higher way (fifth-
dimensional). 


Group Ascensions

Many religious and philosophical groups have Ascension stories. To ascend,
one must abide by certain rules: "If you belong to our group and behave in
the manner that we prescribe, then you will ascend with the rest of us."
In this context, Group Ascension s are conditional. 

	There are also stories about Cultural Ascensions where entire
civilizations ascend. As Group Ascensions are conditional, however, it is
unlikely that an entire civilization could ascend. All historic
civilizations have members whose vibrational frequency would disqualify
them from ascending. This leads to the conclusion that Group Ascensions,
at least in the way that groups present them, are illusions. 

	On the plus side, those involved with these movements can find the
company comforting and supportive. There are many others who share one's
vision of salvation. 


Planetary Ascensions

Planetary Ascensions come in two flavors - Conditional and Unconditional.
In Conditional Planetary Ascensions, anyone who meets certain criteria
enters the Kingdom. If they do not, they are left behind. 

	Essentailly, these are planet-wide Group Ascensions, made up of
consciously advanced members of various groups. No single group has an
exclusive on the Event. It is improbable that all the members of any one
group ascends.  

	There are many psychological forces at play for those pursuing
Conditional Ascension. They can manifest as "Get yourself together,
quick!" or "Go out and save everyone!" or "Fight the Evil!" or "You've got
to be in the right place so the e.t.'s can beam you up!" It is dualistic
by nature. 

	Conversely, in an Unconditional Ascension, the planetary
consciousness invites all of its inhabitants to enter the Garden. Our
information states that the Ascension of Planet Earth will be the first
Unconditional Ascension in the history of the Universe. 
                                                  
Unconditional Ascension psychology says, "We are all in the hands of our
spirit. The 'Third- and Fourth-Dimensional Reality' phase is ending for
the planet. It is time for everyone to come home." It represents a
planetary expression of unconditional love. 

	Our motivation for participating is, "It is my job, and I love my
work [most of the time]."  ***


......................................................................
......................................................................


Liberation and The Unconditional Ascension

Unconditional Ascension means that everyone, regardless of how flawed we
judge them to be, will have the option to ascend. There will be objections
to this, stemming from our third- and fourth-dimensional belief systems.
If we put a price on salvation - have limits on love and forgiveness -
unconditional ascension will sound unfair. This is to be expected. The
planetary consciousness has *structurally designed our vehicle (the
mental, emotional, and physical bodies) to love conditionally.*

	Eventually, however, the entire universe - with everyone in it -
will leap back into the Source. Earth's Unconditional Ascension heralds
this Event. By understanding the principle of unconditional ascension, we
realize that we do not have to save others or the world. This is very
liberating. Even saving ourselves is a fear-based activity. If our true
identity is Divine, who will condemn us? 

	Instead of the Ascension being "The Day of Judgment," it will be
"The Day of Forgiveness." This embodies the loving nature of The Christ
more accurately, as we are *all* Children of God.  ***

*** "The Orion Ascension Technologies"

"The Orion Ascension Technologies" are a set of nine interactive,
code-activated tools. They are interactive in the sense that the user
activates them with specific codes, visualizations, or symbols. These
technologies build upon one another. 

	For example, the first, "Processing Planetary Hallucinations,"
links the individual directly to the plane of archetypes. When the
universe sees someone working at this level, it responds. "Here is a being
who is working directly with human archetypes. He will need a greater
energy base to do this. Make it so." Then the universe rearranges itself
to accommodate this new energetic state. This new foundation enables the
user to experience the delightfully esoteric energies of the second
technology, "Spiritual Synchronization." 

	"The Orion Ascension Technologies" are unique in another way: We
use them for a certain length of time and then "absorb" them – embody
their energetic structure. They become part of us. It is a form of E.T.
Alchemy.  The work culminates with the application of the ninth
technology: The Suit of Light. This establishes a firm and permanent link
between our physical embodiment and the I AM. This Light link is dynamic
in the sense that we feel it, initially, as a small be am focused on our
Heart Chakra. It then expands, encompassing us in a column of Light. The
following is a brief summary of the nine steps. 

"Processing Planetary Hallucinations"

This technology, using codes and visualizations, rapidly expands the Heart
Chakra. It allows us to work directly with planetary archetypes. 

"Spiritual Synchronization"

The focus of this exquisite technology is on the Third Eye. We redefine
The Self in cosmic terms with every application. It injects a most holy
energy into the body. 

"Ecstatic Future-Self Overlays"

This works intensely with the First Chakra. It etches lines of
communication through the time/space continuum. We connect to the energies
of our ecstatic future self while in our present embodiment. 

"The Totem"

The universe determines what kind of reality to manifest based on the
information we act upon. This information sources from either the
physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual body. This technology works with
the Crown Chakra, urging us to act from the spiritual body. 

"Re-interpreting Planetary Communications"

This tool expands our work from the planetary to the interplanetary
realms. When we use it, we create an even broader energy base for us to
use. 

"Restructuring Internal Hells"

This technology evokes vast, inner transmutation. It transforms internal
"dark caverns" into luminous galleries of Light. 

"Agony and Ecstasy"

There are many dualistic patterns that are inherent in the human
condition. This technology disassembles the self-created "roller-coaster"
variety. 

"No Handles"

There are situations in which the mental body cannot easily grasp the
source of negativity. This technology addresses negative situations
without first having to figure out exactly what it is. 

"Suit of Light"

The Orion Ascension Technologies culminate in the creation of the Suit of
Light. We have seen the golden symbols of each of the eight previous
technologies embedded in a swirling vortex - The Suit - of Light. We
activate it by using customized commands. 
  

'The Orion Ascension Technologies" is available on cassette tapes. It
includes "The Sonic Rites Initiations I - III." The donation for the set
is $345. 

................................................................
................................................................

*** "The Heart Chakra Hypercube"
(or “Struggle Buffers”)

We developed this technology especially for those beings who are
participating in "Upward Movement" (UM). UM is how most beings try to
"work through their stuff," struggling all the way. This shifts that
energy, releasing a great amount of blocked energy from the Heart Chakra. 

No prerequisites required.

It is an At-A-Distance Grid Application. 

The donation for The Heart Chakra Hypercube is $99.

..................................................................

*** "Downward Movement Technology"

A potent tool for those exploring Downward Movement. A code activated
technology. 

The donation for the Downward Movement Technology is $77.

................................................................

*** "Tune-Up" A Tune-Up consists of a brief consultation followed by a
crystal layout and the application of several tools ("The Mystic
Accellerator," "Etheric Laser Scalpel," and others). Available at
Starbuilders Transformatioal Center. 

The donation for a Tune-up is $55.

Sonic Technologies


Please Note: These tapes are sonic applications that disassemble
disharmonic energy structures within one’s system. Some beings have strong
emotional reactions when listening, while others appreciate this style of
sound. 

Some beings report that if they listen while they (or their environment)
are tense, the sounds magnify the tension. Others have reported that the
sounds actually relieve tension. 

.........................................................

*** "Sonic Access"  $11

This collection of channeled sounds "flips on internal switches." We
recommend using headphones (for all sonic tapes).

energy." - Andron

................................................................

||| "The Sonic Rites Initations, I, II, and III” ||| $17 each.

We view these sounds as symbolic structures, many of whose meanings have
no easy translation into human language.
