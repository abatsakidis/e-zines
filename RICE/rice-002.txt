        this 'zine is shareware.  however, if it evokes thought, or drives
 you to any sort of emotion, wether it be happiness, anger, pity, or the
 like; you owe us, like, $8.50.
 
        if you are offended by anything published in rice, you are seriously 
 one dumb motherfucker & if we ever get our hands on you, we will beat your
 stupid ass to a bloodied pulp.
        
        thanks.

 introduction
 by - dead cheese

        hey kids.  welcome to the second issue of rice.  we've received quite
 a reaction to rice since we released the first issue.  it seems that around
 90% of the people who read rice, enjoy it.  9% are members of doomed to 
 obscurity, a poorly managed, poorly written 'zine that frannie and i quit to 
 devote our full attentions to rice.  the other 1% are assorted farm animals
 and household appliances who refused to comment intelligibly.
        we were shocked at the reactions we received, both good and bad.  
 they ranged from "this is one of the best 'zines i've ever read!" to 
 "where's the humor?  am i missing something?" to "moo."  several people 
 cheered us for quitting dto and "fighting" the juggernaut blight that has 
 deprived the underground 'zine world of growth and creativity.  rice is not 
 about fighting anything but prejudice and discrimination against rice and 
 rice products.  mostly, we're in this to have fun.  we don't care about 
 numbers of readers, or how the format excludes certain people, or about 
 getting on daytime tv talk shows.  black francis and i just like to write.

        beware the rice revolution.

 reflect the mindset of the entire rice militia, for he is a communist.

  by - black francis

        hi.
        
        in the previous issue of rice, i published an article entitled "die,
  bF, die!", which i wholeheartedly believed was written by cerkit.  well,
  come 6/17/96, vanir confronted me on irc to let me know *he* was the one 
  who actually wrote that article; *not* cerkit.  so, my apologies to you,
  cerkit.
        ok, you can all make fun of vanir now.
 
        also, we of the rice militia would like to extend our metaphoric hand
 & welcome styx to our humble organization.  his service begins this issue.
 also joining styx in the rice legacy; ideal & mercuri, who have enlisted 
 with our ever-growing legion of rice freedom fighters.  your contributions 
 to the cause are greatly appreciated, men.

        at ease.

 "the rice militia list of demands"
 by - the rice militia
 
 1)  the well-being & love for all rice & rice products.
          
 2)  the beating, maiming, torture, & eventual death of uncle ben & his rice
 opressing thugs.
        
 3)  the demise of communism because we all know communists hate rice.
  
 4)  that rice be recognized as the caring, loving, nutritious grain that it 
 is.
         
 5)  that all strains of rice be treated with the respect due to a food of
 such high caliber.
    
        &
 
 6)  the institution of rice as the united states of america's official food.

        we will not reason nor will we take "no" for an answer.
        
        we of the rice militia do find this document to be consistent with 
 our beliefs as they are contained within the sound minds & bodies of the
 members of the rice militia.  it is with great pride & a shining hope that
 the rice militia produces this electronic magazine.  thank you for your
 time.
        
        resistance is futile.

 "distorted"
 by - dead cheese

        why do you haunt me?  why do you follow me where i go?  i am not your
 whore.  i go where i want, where i need.  i am not yours to flog.  yeah, you
 like to beat me with your whip.  you like to see me bleed.  you like to pour
 the sweet juices on my open, weeping sores.  you watch it drip down my back,
 swirling in multiple shades of crimson.. watch it until it threatens to 
 plummet to the floor before you swipe it with your tongue.  your sick, 
 twisted desires have become needs, obsessions.  you are unable to
 distinguish fantasy from reality.  can't you see what's happening, happened,
 will happen?  open your eyes and see the comets racing from star to star.
 believe in the magic of gods long dead and beings from places long
 forgotten.  the end is nigh, but the sky is high and it's a long time coming
 down.  we'll laugh in the dark sunlight filtering through the disease and
 ravages of time.  we'll bask in the polluted light of your imagination.  the
 light rains, pours on my head and i laugh at the folly of it all.  it pours
 down on me and i feel it beating against my skull.  ..let me in.. ..release
 me.. but i can fight.  i am strong, i am strong, i am powerful in my own
 right and i will fight you.  you would not have it any other way.  you
 thrill for the chase, the hunt, the game, the inevitable kill.  ..not this 
 time, lover.  i am fast.  my mind is quick and i race from moon to sun in 
 quicksilver flashes, though it be my end.  i race around your black light 
 and i look, i watch scornfully.  i see your torment and your delight in mine
 and i laugh, simply throw back my head and laugh at the irony.  you want me
 as you and it's working, but it will end soon, lover.  it will surely end
 for i am through with this play, this silly game we frolic through night and
 day.  do you see how it shines, glistens in the light?  do you not see?  it
 is so beautiful, though it is death in thine eye.  i twist, lunge, thrust,
 and twist again.  so pretty, the colors.  see how they swirl along the edges
 of your skin?  they follow where they lead.  i don't want, i don't _need_
 the juices to see the pleasure in it.  i can see.  i see it all.  don't
 worry, lover.  i'll bring me to you soon.  maybe we can play again, where
 only the stars give light.  we will play, then.

 "frank esposito, world's worst detective, does it again!"
 by - black francis

        for many months, explicit rumors of atrocities & horrors unseen
 taking place from behind the black iron wrought gates of 2856 spruce street
 circulated throughout the small innocent suburban community of chesterville,
 iowa.  local children & family pets were disappearing at an alarming rate
 while vagrants, drifters, squatters, & runaways were spotted entering the
 large stucco dwelling only never to be seen alive again.  residents, while
 not gagging on the horrid stench of rotting flesh that loomed over their
 entire neighborhood, even claimed to have seen bloodied body parts dangling
 from the green plastic trash bags in front of the property.
        under intense pressure from city officials & guys with big fuzzy
 hats, the chesterville police department decided to make haste, using what
 little evidence they had managed to gather.  thinking swiftly, & moving
 twice as fast, they sent frank esposito, world's worst detective, to
 investigate.
        after scaling a rusty barbed wire fence & fighting off a vicious
 attack dog under the unrelenting august sun, detective esposito knocked upon 
 the vault-sized steel door at the front of the house & was greeted by a
 large dark skinned man, whose hands were encrusted with blood.
        
        "good afternoon, sir.  i'm detective frank esposito, with the
 chesterville police department.  do you mind if i ask you a few questions?"
 posed the detective as he removed a small notepad from his trenchcoat pocket
 & flipped it open to an empty page.         
        "what do you want, you fuckin' pig?" the man snarled, obviously
 agitated by frank's presence.
        "has there been any killing, maiming, or any other violent illegal
 activities taking place inside this residence?" he asked as he removed a pen
 from his other trenchcoat pocket.  the man at the door looked nervous.
        "uh ... no.  no, there hasn't."
        the detective smiled at the man & promptly closed his notepad.
        "ok, sir.  thank you very much for your cooperation.  i hope i didn't
 disturb you."
        the detective then his notepad & placed it, along with the pen, back 
 into his trenchcoat.  he bid the gentleman farewell & made his way back to
 his squad car, carefully stepping over the decapitated heads of children 
 sprawled amongst the walkway.
        detective esposito received a promotion for his work in the case &
 was assigned to lead an elite task force of really clueless bastards before
 mysteriously DISAPPEARING while patrolling spruce street.
        a highway rest stop now stands in his honor.

 "little johnny"
 by - dead cheese

 little johnny was a sight to see.
 all covered in dirt was he.
 his trousers were worn,
 thus earning the scorn,
 of his mother, his father, and me.

 little johnny was playing where he shouldn't have been.
 what could've caused him to commit such a sin?
 his ball had gone outside the fence.
 it cost him all of three pence!
 so he chased it to bring it back in.

 little johnny climbed over the pickets..
 and fell in the thorny thickets!
 pulling his way free,
 he earned a scrape on the knee,
 limping as though he had rickets!

 little johnny looked all around.
 with his eyes, he scanned the ground.
 he searched all he could,
 but though his eyes were good,
 his ball was not to be found.

 little johnny didn't notice the man.
 the man had an axe in his hand!
 i thought he was bolder,
 but the man's hand on his shoulder
 made johnny scared and he ran!

 little johnny dashed for his yard.
 his skin and his clothes were scarred.
 he had such a fright,
 stayed up through the night,
 and used teddy as a guard!

 little johnny's lesson was learned.
 more his pride, than his knee, was burned.
 the man with the axe was good.
 he was only chopping wood!
 and johnny's ball was returned.

 the rice militia selected incident chronology
 by - the rice militia

        august 1981 - bombed the us embassy, the bank of america, the
 coca-cola bottler, & a dairy product firm associated with the carnation
 company, all in lima.

        july 1982 - threw two dynamite bombs at the us embassy & set off
 bombs at three private businesses, injuring three people.

        august 1984 - burned an evangelical church run by us missionaries in
 southeastern ayacucho department.

        march 1986 - assassinated three provincial mayors by shooting them in
 the head in the town of chacra pampas.

        may 1986 - rice militia member black francis was arrested for having
 a bomb in his luggage at schiphol airport in amsterdam.  he was later 
 deported to japan.  black francis had been a member of the black helmet
 (kuro hero) radical organization in japan before that group joined forces
 with the rice militia in 1971.

        june 1986 - indonesian police released photographs of dead cheese,
 17, a rice militia member whose fingerprints were found in a hotel room from
 which crude mortars were fired at the japanese & us embassy buildings in
 jakarta on may 14.  the anti-imperialist international brigades (the rice
 militia) claimed responsibility.

        march 1987 - took over a radio station, invaded a church, & occupied
 a private manufacturing concern to give revolutionary speeches & urge
 participation in the "armed struggle."  this form of propagandizing was a
 new modus operandi for the rice militia.

        june 1987 - fired two rockets at the british embassy in rome.  about
 30 minutes later, detonated a car bomb across the street at the us embassy
 compound.  once again, the aiib claimed responsibility, leading to the
 belief of rice militia involvement.

        october 1987 - when 12 captured rice militia members committed
 suicide by taking cyanide capsules, the group unleashed a wave of terrorist
 attacks in reprisal, killing more than 200, including several captured sri
 lankan soldiers.
