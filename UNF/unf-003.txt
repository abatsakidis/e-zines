===] phile 003 [=] MetallicA: No Leaf Clover / - Human Lyrics [=] Johnny^B [===-

Ever since the first Metallica/Symphonica bootlegs came out, several people
have asked me the question: "Where can I find the clover/human lyrics?"

Well, up until tonight, I didn't know! It seems that noone I knew felt like
posting them.. (shame on you guys, do I really have to do everything myself?)

So, to help those of you who might still not have found the lyrics, I went
home and listened to S&M full blast until I was able to make sense of the
lyrics. (believe me, my neighbours were pissed) So to those of you who might
find this remotely interesting, here are the lyrics for the two new 'Tallica
songs. Compliments of Johnny^B:

No leaf clover
--------------

and it feels right this time
on this crash course with this big time
pay no mind to the distant thunder
today fills his head with wonder

said it feels right this time
turned around and found a bright light
good day to be alive, yes sir
god day to be alive, he said

and then it comes to be
that the soothing light at the end of the tunnel
was just a freight train coming your way

and then it comes to be
that the soothing light at the end of the tunnel
was just a freight train coming your way

don't it feel right like this
all the pieces fall to his wish
sucker for that quick reward, boy
sucker for that quick reward, they say

and then it comes to be
that the soothing light at the end of the tunnel
was just a freight train coming your way

and then it comes to be
that the soothing light at the end of the tunnel
was just a freight train coming your way

and then it comes to be
that the soothing light at the end of the tunnel
was just a freight train coming your way

- Human (Minus Human)
---------------------

Don't you leave me, father time
take me with you

tell me does your sun still shine?
come squeeze the world and drip it down my throath
oh, yeah... down my throath again

you've got to breathe, man, breathe
coming up for air
you've got to breathe, man, breathe
coming up for ... air

touch me so I think I'm here
skin my senses
barely breathing
minus human
squeeze the world and drip it down my throath
oh, yeah... down my throath again

you've got to breathe, man, breathe
coming up for air
you've got to breathe, man, breathe
coming up for ... air

you've got to breathe, man, breathe
coming up for air
you've got to breathe, man, breathe
coming up for ... air

------------------------------

Well, that's it, now was that really so hard? Hope you enjoyed this! After
all, we're all MetallicA fans, right? Yeah, and we all worship the devil!
Oh, no? Of course we do, we're MetallicA fans, all Heavy Metal fans worship
the devil, right?@!~! and make human sacrifices, and drink blood, and have
wicked sex orgies - heh, I wish... Okay, so maybe we don't worship the devil
but hey, that doesn't mean we can't have fun, and tell people that we do,
right? I've done it heaps of times myself. Whenever I run into religious
fanatics or other equally clueless fucks, I just tell them that I worship the
devil and see what happens, I've had some really funny experiences involving
religious fanatics. Look forward to a upcoming phile about that!

As always, contributions/comments are welcome... uNF wants you for world
