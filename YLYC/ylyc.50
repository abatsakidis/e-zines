Letter from the Editor

Happy April everyone! This being Cancer month, it seems 
only fitting that we make people aware of how serious this 
illness is, and hopefully share some news too.  The American 
Cancer Society states that in the year 2000, about 1,220,100 
new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed. This  is the 
second leading cause of death in the US, the first being heart 
disease.

It looks as though there may be some wonderful break throughs 
on the horizon. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have 
conducted studies on new ways of detecting cancer other than 
biopsies. It seems that certain cancers can be caught by testing 
related body fluids, saliva showed changes associated with head 
and neck cancer, bladder cancer was discovered by testing urine, 
and samples of lung fluid can indicate a presence of lung cancer.

Doctors may soon be able to better tailor cancer treatments 
to the individual. Scientists are working with computer 
technology that can monitor thousands of genes in cancer 
cells, making the diagnosis of cancers much more precise. 

Scientists are already aware of signs that are indicative 
that some cells are likely to become cancerous. Still in the
experimental stages, is a vaccine designed to encourage 
the immune system to recognize and destroy those "marked" 
breast cells. This type of treatment is geared to prevention, 
and it's planned use is for women at high risk of obtaining 
breast cancer. 

It is quite common for people with cancer to incorporate 
complementary therapies with their treatments. There are 
a number of natural methods that have shown to be helpful 
in relieving pain, minimizing the side effects of traditional 
treatments, and improving the quality of life. 

A macrobiotic diet has been known to help some cancer patients.
An American physician, Anthony Sattilaro, claims to have cured 
himself of advanced prostatic cancer using this diet. However, 
there are varying levels of intensity, and there are some areas of 
the macrobiotic diet that are somewhat questionable. So I 
caution you to ensure that your guide in this diet is highly 
reputable and qualified, and your physician is involved in 
the process. 

There are a great number of herbs that are helpful in 
dealing with various aspects of this disease. There are 
blood cleansers and immune system builders, stress 
relievers, herbs to help recover from chemotherapy, and 
many more advantages. Some helpful herbs are Pau D'Arco, 
ginseng, green tea, beta-carotene, echinecea, astragalus, 
chaparral, garlic and mistletoe to name only a few. 

Aromatherapy, meditation, art therapy, t'ai chi, music 
therapy, yoga and massage therapy are all avenues that 
can be very instrumental in alleviating the stress that 
always accompanies this disease.

Nutritional Therapy is an avenue that many cancer victims 
pursue. A diet filled with whole grains, vegetables, and fruits; 
high in fiber, low in refined sugars and sodium and low in fat. 
Typically a vegetarian diet is recommended with no meat, 
poultry, and fish. 

High doses of vitamin C are often prescribed to cancer patients. 
Researchers have found that  tumors often shrink after vitamin 
C treatments. It has also been known to reduce some of the 
side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Being 
a tremendous antioxidant, Vitamin C is very effective in 
repairing free radical damage.

There are many holistic treatments to consider. I encourage 
you to investigate as many as you can, as thoroughly as you 
can. Remember you will have issues to address such as the 
efficacy and quality of supplements, quantities to consume, 
interactions amongst each other, your medication as well as 
any other health issues. I strongly recommend that you be 
certain you are working with a certified practitioner for all 
the avenues that you pursue, and include your doctor in 
these decisions. There is no reason that you shouldn't have 
consultations including your physician, your holistic 
practitioner(s), and yourself. This way everyone can work 
together in your best interest with no misunderstandings.
Enjoy the newsletter, and stay well until next time.

 "Foot Reflexology: Health Conditions Revealed and Healed" 
				by Laurel Duran

For over two thousand years, the Chinese have relied upon
their knowledge of the body's intangible electrical system to 
bring about physical healing. The intuitive science of 
acupuncture is based upon the fact that when the normal flow 
of body energy (chi) is blocked, disease can result. By applying 
very thin needles to specific points on the body, the 
acupuncturist can either increase the energy flow (tonify), or
decrease an overabundance of energy flow (sedate), thereby 
helping the body to heal itself. The massage technique known 
as acupressure works on the same theory as acupuncture, but 
instead of using needles, the massage therapist uses her 
fingertips. 

Foot reflexology is considered to be a sister science to 
acupuncture because it is based on the fact that the feet 
contain energy spillage points which originate in specific 
internal organs. Foot reflexology is, in very simple terms, 
the intuitive science of applying finger pressure to the feet 
for the purpose of releasing any blocked organ energy that 
has spilled there. By applying pressure, not only will the 
crystalline energy spills dissolve and move, but the organ 
connected to the spill will receive the electrical impulse to 
flow freely once again. The Creator designed the feet to 
serve as miniature blueprints for the entire physical body. 
Very briefly, the heels contain spillage points for the lower 
back, reproductive organs, hips and legs. On the mid-section 
of the bottoms of the feet there are spillage points connected 
to the colon and the kidneys, and on the upper half of the 
bottoms of the feet, just as in the body's upper half, there 
are spillage points connected to the stomach, liver, spleen, 
pancreas, heart, breasts and lungs. On the tops of the feet 
between the tarsal and metatarsal bones, there are upper 
back and between-shoulder-blade spillage points. At the 
base of the toes there are spillage points for the eyes, ears, 
neck and throat. The great toes contain spillage points for 
the brain, pineal and pituitary glands, while the 4 remaining 
toes are connected to the sinuses. This way of translating 
foot problems through the language of foot reflexology is 
radically different from the way podiatrists view the feet. 
Whereas podiatry works on the belief that the feet are a 
sort of closed system, having little if anything to do with 
how the rest of the body functions, foot reflexology not 
only accepts that by applying pressure to the feet the 
condition of the internal organs and the entire body improves, 
but also the condition of the feet gives valuable clues about 
the person's entire health. 

For example, if a massage therapy client complains of soreness 
in her heels, she may also be experiencing sciatic pain and lower 
back pain. By both massaging the lower back/buttocks muscles 
and applying deep finger pressure to break up the crystals in the 
bottoms of the heels, the blocked energy which manifested as 
sciatic and low back pain can be eliminated or at least greatly 
reduced. 

I have often found that folks who have calluses on the outside 
of their great toes characteristically have neck tension. These 
two areas are directly connected to eachother. If a person has 
bunions or plantars warts anywhere on their feet, it is because 
the internal organ is attempting to release toxins. The reason 
why having a podiatrist remove the bunion or plantar's wart 
usually does not solve the problem is that the source of the 
problem - congestion in the corresponding internal organ - is 
not addressed. More often than not I have heard massage 
clients' stories of how they returned to the podiatrist again 
and again to repeat the same ultimately unsuccessful surgical 
removal procedure. Only when the client nutritionally 
detoxifies the corresponding internal organ along with 
receiving bodywork sessions (foot reflexology, massage 
therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic, polarity therapy, to 
name a few), do the feet cease to receive toxic spillage 
from the originating organ and ultimately heal. The 
corresponding internal organ receives healing to boot 
(that's a foot pun)! 

There are many bodyworkers who, like myself, fold foot 
reflexology into their whole bodywork sessions, and many 
who administer only foot reflexology. Many health food 
stores and book stores carry books on foot reflexology that 
include a "map" of the feet. Whether you are a professional 
bodyworker or a novice to the idea, having your feet massaged 
can positively alter your whole health while making you feel 
pleasantly relaxed. Foot reflexology is a wonderfully easy tool 
for self-healing!

Section 2 
	Periodontal Disease; Most Adults Have It 
		by Dr. Jacob Trager, DDS 
	        http://www.dentalwellness.net/

In our last article I listed the various causative and 
contributing factors specific to dental disharmonyh 
or dis-ease.

In this, and the next several articles, I will focus on 
the most prevalent adult dental problem, Periodontal 
Disease.
	- There are 32 million people in the U.S. with 
	   severe periodontal disease.
	- One out of four will lose their teeth by the 
	   time they are 60 years of age.
	- 9 out of 10 will suffer periodental disease in 
	   their lifetime.

It is important for you to know that this disease is preventable 
and can be reversed and healed.

I will share with you the initial assessment sessions of my 
preventative and healing periodental program available 
through my telephone consulting services. Through this 
assessment you will gain the widespread proliferation of 
this disease.

Before we begin, let's talk about what is periodontal disease.
Periodontal refers to the structures which surround the teeth 
and attach the roote of the teeth into the jaw bone. These 
structures are comprised of resilient onnective tissue fibers 
(gums), nerves and blood vessels.

It is the disruption of the balance or energy in these intricate 
structures, through some disharmony, that opens the path for 
disease. Our focus, therefore, is to restore balance and 
harmony, not only to the periodontal structures, but to the 
whole person. A disturbance in one part of ourselves is both 
a reflection and expression that our wholeness is not in 
harmony. Restoring harmony to the whole will provide the 
foundation for healing the part that is ill. This is the basis of 
our work and follows the ancient healing philosophy of 
hippocrates, and other great initiates. A science we call 
Initiatic or Esoteric Science.

This information will give you an understanding of how and 
why we approach the prevention and treatment or periodontal 
or any other dental disease of disturbance.

Now we can begin the assessment sessions. When these are 
completed, reviewed and evaluated, an individualized program 
of guidance, treatment interventions, excercizes and suggestions 
is undertaken in order to achieve healing and well being.

As I share this information picture in your "mind's eye" that 
I am working and talking directly to you. Keep a notebook 
and write the answers to the questions for yourself. In this 
way you will become aware of the multiplicity of causes and 
contributing factors unique to your particular problem. If 
you are a care giver or are the responsible person for health 
in your family, you can play my role and ask the questions to 
whoever needs help with this or anyh particular dental problem. 
You may also become aware of additional factors that will 
apply specifically to you as you review all of the gathered 
information.

So, let's begin...
1. In your own words describe the nature of your problem or 
concern.
	A. How long have you been aware of the problem?
		1) When it began?
		2) Has there been a history of this or any other 
		     problem?
			a) with yourself
			b) with a family member

		3) Is the problem worsening?
		4) How have you handled the problem until now?
			a) Have you had any treatments? If yes,
			b) What experience did you have?
			c) Was the treatment successful? If no,
			d) What complications developed?

		5) How do you feel about the problem that is 
		    challenging you right now?
			a) In the past?
			b) Was the onset of the problem gradual 
			     or did it seem to appear all at once?

(In the process of this assessment or history/intake you are 
beginning the journey of awareness, which is "key" to unfolding 
health and wellness)

Before we take an indepth look a the physical, mental and 
emotional stressors that may be contributing to your problem, 
I would like you to rate the following:

A. Your level of Concern from 0-10, with 10 being the most 
     concern you have every felt.
B. The seriousness of the problem you are currently facing.
C. The level of anxiety associated with the problem or possible 
     treatments
D. The level of fear associated with the problem or possible 
     treatment.

In our next article we will take you step by step through the 
possible factors that may be influencing your situation. You 
may want to refer to our list in last month's article to give you 
an opportunity to become more aware of your own circumstances 
before our next article.

I wish you harmony and health in all your endeavors.

Section 3 
		The Key To Optimal Health 
		      By Rita Louise, ND

During the past 20 years, we have heard a lot about controlling 
disease through diet, exercise and food supplements, but not 
much is being said as to how to prevent disease before it 
occurs. We are all are born with both inherent strengths 
and weaknesses as part of our genetic inheritance. All of 
the tissues in our bodies, whether of bone, muscle, gland 
or organ, have a unique balance of chemical elements that 
are designed to work in harmony with one another. It is 
now believed, that all chronic diseases are accompanied 
by nutritional deficiencies and imbalances in the essential 
chemical elements that make up the body.

Many of us think of nutritional deficiencies in terms of an 
inadequate diet. This is often the case. According to Jeffrey 
Bland, Ph.D., the leading nutritional problem in the US 
today is that many of us eat too many "empty calorie foods".
 It is not that we do not eat enough food, but instead, we 
don't eat enough of the right kinds of foods. It is now felt 
that it is the consumption of a majority of inappropriate 
foods that lead to nutritional deficiencies in the body.

There are, however, other ways in which the body exhausts
its valuable supply of chemical elements. Excessive mental 
work, for example, can deplete the brain, nerves and glands. 
Stress can wreak havoc on our immune system. Toxins can 
to build up in our bodies, leading to chemical depletion. We 
can simply neglect our bodies or forget to get enough fresh 
air, sunshine and exercise. Any abuse or overwork to our 
bodies, in addition to any inherent weakness we may have, can 
leave us with nutritional deficiencies.

Once the body is depleted of its needed chemical elements, the 
breakdown of tissue beings to occur. It is typically followed by 
the gradual accumulation of toxic materials in the tissue. Once 
nutritional deficiencies have weakened a particular organ, gland 
or tissue, toxic material begins to accumulate because they have 
no power or energy left to throw it off.

Symptoms of ill health are the consequence of nutritional 
deficiencies and chemical imbalances in the body. Deficiencies 
may not express themselves as symptoms for quite some time. 
Typically, the first symptom of disease to appear is fatigue. 
Next, we may get frequent infections, colds and the flu. 
Many times symptoms are taken for granted as a natural sign 
of aging. When left unchecked, however, these same deficiencies 
can contribute to chronic disease such as arteriosclerosis, high 
blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Finally, after 10 - 20 
miserable years of limping through life, we die.

The appearance of symptoms marks the clinical stage of a disease. 
When the skin becomes dry, when we have pain in the shoulder, 
when we have excessive bloating, gas, constipation or diarrhea 
each tell us that something is wrong.

Scientists now recognize that even mild nutritional deficiencies 
and biochemical imbalances can create subtle symptoms of 
disease. Although there IS a point of no return in tissue damage 
caused by severe long-term deficiencies, it is surprising to see 
how well the body responds to nutritional correction. It has 
been found that with nutritional supplementation and dietary
 improvements, you can work toward the remission of 
symptoms and the reversal of the disease process. As the 
chemical signs of deficiency are eased, it has been found that 
many of the sub-clinical symptoms being experienced are 
alleviated.

Prevention of chemical depletion is the key to optimal health. 
Even in cases of AIDS, people don't die from AIDS proper. 
They die from AIDS related diseases. In other words, they die
from weaknesses in the body. The same holds true for 
individuals with Cancer. Currently the only cure western 
medicine has for cancer is chemotherapy, radiation or cutting 
it out. What they do not realize is that anyone with cancer 
also has many other conditions that should be taken care of. 
Such a person will never be truly "cured" until integrity is
restored to the rest of the inherently weak tissues that have 
toxic settlements and mineral deficiencies.

Natural Health Practitioners think in terms of treating the 
patient, not just the disease or the symptoms. They consider
each patient as an individual with individual needs. Their 
goal is to see their patients return to normal health, but 
normal for one patient may not be the same as normal for 
another.

One way to evaluate your nutritional needs is to obtain a 
Biochemical Health Assessment. A complete Biochemical 
Health Assessment not only evaluates your health based 
on lifestyle factors and symptoms you may be currently 
experiencing, but also utilizes information derived from a 
simple blood test, which identifies your specific bio-chemical 
needs. 

Standard blood tests only identify clinical signs of 
dysfunction. They tell you when something is broken. 
A Biochemical Health Assessment, on the other hand, 
evaluates your body's biochemistry based on a state of 
optimal physical health and wellbeing. It identifies when 
there are imbalances in your body's biochemistry and 
chemical make-up.

This evaluation can provide you with a portal through 
which you can detect health or disease. By looking for 
sub-clinical discrepancies, you may prevent disease 
before symptoms, occur. Knowledge of your body's 
blood chemistry is your best defense against degenerative 
disease. This allows you to begin a health program long 
before these issues reach the clinical or diseased state.


A complete Biochemical Health Assessment, should evaluate 
your Cholesterol Levels, including your Coronary Heart Risk 
Ratio, your Liver Function, Kidney Function and Thyroid 
Function. It should also assess your Blood Sugar Levels, 
Blood Electrolytes as well as check for signs of Anemia and 
Infection.

Today, an estimated 46% of adult Americans take nutritional 
supplements. It is part of a growing trend as more and more 
people take a proactive approach to their health. Currently, 
there is no "How To" guide to good nutrition and nutritional 
supplementation. We all are different and have different 
nutritional needs. To eliminate a lot of the guesswork and 
frustration, it is to your advantage to work with a trained 
health professional who can asses your health needs and 
that can help you develop a nutritional supplement program 
that is tailored specifically for you.

Think about it. If you start feeding your body the biochemical 
elements it needs, disease can be eliminated before any symptoms 
begin. That is why a Biochemical Health Assessment is the key 
to optimal health.

4. 			Health Smart Recipe 
			  By Edna Laraway

The high fiber in this recipe means that these pancakes 
are helpful in Cancer Prevention. 
--- 
		Pancakes for Power

2 cups whole wheat flour
4 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt (optional)
½ tsp sugar (optional)
or 2 packs sweetener(optional)
2 eggs
1 tbsp oil

Add milk or buttermilk until mixture is pourable.
Heat frying pan at med-high heat until batter sizzles when 
poured in pan. When batter forms bubbles on top turn over, 
and cook until done. (press lightly on pancake with finger,
if it puffs back up, its cooked.)

Again substitute, substitute, substitute!
Whole wheat flour is more nutritious, but if you prefer, add 
½ white flour, and half whole wheat, or use ½ white and 
½ flaxseed. Add fresh fruits for a treat, cherries, blueberries 
and raspbeerries are all a good choice. Add mashed bananas 
and cinnamon, or apple and cinnemon/nutmeg/allspice.

Serve hot on plate with natural maple syrup, or one of the new 
non-sugared varieties.  Serve cold spooning fresh fruit of your 
choice with a scoop of whipped cream as a dessert.
