Wellness - or, simply put, good health - is not necessarily 
the result of what you put into your mouth. The extensive 
research of Joel M. Teutsch and Champion K. Teutsch has shown 
the real cause of sickness or other conditions:

an adverse mind factor and unfavorable genetic predisposition. 
They have learned to modify them for their clients' benefit. 
This does not invalidate the use of diet, vitamins and medication. 
It merely enhances their potent affects on the consumer. 

We feel everyone has a perfect right to the same quick and 
lasting results as their many satisfied clients.

Premenstrual Syndrome, or its more commonly referred to name 
"PMS" is a disorder reserved for women and occurs one to two 
weeks before menstruation. There are over 150 symptoms and 
often women who are affected experience at least several of 
them. This disorder is particularly draining because it 
affects the body both physically and emotionally. The most 
common emotional symptoms being irritability, sluggishness, 
tension, impatience, depression and fatigue. Physically, 
women can experience cramps, breast tenderness, lower back 
pain, headaches, and fluid retention.

Approximately 70-75% of all women experience some or all of 
the above symptoms in varying degrees. About 5% of women are 
so severely affected that it causes them to be incapacitated 
to the point where they cannot work or engage in any activity, 
even getting out of bed. Or it may cause a woman to become so 
violent that she could seriously hurt herself or someone else. 
In fact PMS has even been legally used as a courtroom defense 
for assault.

Another frustrating element of PMS is that there are about as 
many possible causes of the syndrome as there are symptoms. A 
hormonal imbalance is common in most cases of PMS. However, 
other contributing issues could be food allergies, nutritional 
deficiencies, mental and physical stress, low blood sugar levels, 
vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies, and clinical depression 
among many others.

Now... What to do about it! 
Because the symptoms are so varied and can result from a number
of health issues, there is no one "cure all" treatment either 
in Traditional medicine or in Natural treatments. However a 
nutritional and herbal approach is not likely to have the harsh 
side effects as many of the tranquilizers and therapies often 
prescribed in severe cases through Traditional or Western 
medicine. 

Especially if you suffer from severe PMS, your best recourse 
is to see a local Health Care Practitioner. However you can 
discuss with your Naturopath, Herbalist, or Homeopath the 
following possibilities and determine the best avenue for 
you to pursue. 

Black Cohosh is known to reduce the pain from premenstrual 
cramps and combined with Valerian and Skullcap may help to 
stabilize mood swings and reduce stress. NOTE: Do NOT use 
Black Cohosh during pregnancy until labour, as it can be 
helpful in easing the delivery process, and then ONLY under 
the supervision of your doctor.

Dong Quai is referred to as the "queen of all female herbs."  
This herb is helpful in regulating the menstrual cycle and 
is effective in eliminating the pain and discomfort associated 
with PMS.

Both Wild Yam Cream and Extract contain natural progesterone 
hormone and has been helpful for many women in alleviating 
cramps, headaches, mood swings, depression and irritability.

Blessed Thistle helps to balance the hormones and can decrease 
the intensity of cramps. It can help to regulate the menstrual 
cycle, lower fevers, and is useful in treating liver problems. 
Typically this herb is taken in combination with other herbs 
specifically designed for women.

Those are just a few of the many herbs that can offer you relief 
from your monthly distress. Depending on your symptoms, your 
Health Care Practitioner may also suggest Red Raspberries, Kava 
Kava, Hawthorn Berries, Angelica Root, Uva Ursi, or Evening 
Primrose to name only a few. Let your practitioner guide you to 
those that would be most helpful to you, and enjoy the months 
to come.

Section 5      	    The Aromas of Autumn

----------      
 
    Spectacular autumn has arrived again with its splendid 
colored foliage, a nip of frost and many invigorating spicy 
aromas. Childhood memories bring back the tantalizing smell 
of mother's chili sauce simmering on the stove, the whiff 
of pungent dill from home-made pickles and the mouth-watering 
aromas emanating from the sage dressing in the holiday turkey- 
Who could ever forget the incredible taste of nutmeg and 
cinnamon that turned a bland pumpkin squash into a heavenly-
tasting pie.
 
    Today, spices are easily obtained and widely used but in 
days of yore they were rare and expensive. The search for
precious spices brought westerners to the Orient and sent 
explorers on incredible journeys to find a shorter route to 
the Spice Lands.
 
    Most people are familiar with the advantages of using 
spices to enhance the taste of food but there are also many 
useful essential oils that originate from spice plants.  
The oils from these plants are extracted from the whole 
plant, leaves, twigs, roots and seeds.  These oils are used 
to alleviate conditions of digestive upset, aches, pains, 
colds, flu and infections. For instance, oil derived from 
ginger root can be used to aid in the relief of rheumatism, 
muscular aches and pains, sprains, broken bones, colds, 
nausea, diarrhea, alcoholism and digestive disorders. Other 
beneficial oils are derived from basil, bay, cinnamon, clove, 
dill, nutmeg, sage and many more. 
 
    Be sure to check what part of the plant is to be used 
for oil extraction.  For example an oil made from cinnamon 
BARK is not to be used.  Oils from nutmeg and thyme should 
be avoided during pregnancy and basil, cinnamon leaf, nutmeg 
and thyme should only be used for a few days at a  time.  
 
    Now for a few practical suggestions:
 
CLOVE OIL: For abdominal pain: 
Upper abdominal area - apply the following oil over the 
painful area in a clockwise direction.
Peppermint      3 drops
Clove           2 drops
Diluted in one teaspoon of vegetable oil
 
THYME OIL:
Lower abdominal area pain (clockwise direction)
Thyme           2 drops
Eucalyptus      3 drops
Diluted in one teaspoon of vegetable oil
 
*abdominal pain should be checked by a doctor if it persists 
or increases in intensity.
 
Stress Relievers
 
    Environmental stress in the office or factory can be 
relieved with basil oil. Physical stress can be lessened 
by using fennel, marjoram and thyme.  Basil aids in the 
relief of mental stress. Make up a mixture in a spray 
bottle and use it around your workplace. Others will 
benefit from this as well. Also, you can dab some oil 
on a tissue and sniff or put a dab of oil between your 
nose and upper lip.
 
    So there you are- enjoy the wonderful aromas of the 
kitchen and then set out to enrich your workplace with 
spicy essential oils.

Section 6     THE CRITCAL IMPORTANCE OF CYCLING AND
                     STACKING IN ANTI-AGING
                        by Dr. John Maher
                   http://www.RxforWellness.com 
-----

"The most dynamic age reversing effects are seen with 
an intergrated program of HRT (hormone replacement 
therapy), antioxidants, exercise, and diet along with 
HGH or its precursors" - R. Klatz,M.D. President of A4M 
(The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine). 

Combining many elements together to get a heightened 
response is referred to as "stacking", a term that comes 
to us from the bodybuilding community. When "stacked" 
one on top of the other, the effect is synergistic and 
the result adds up to MORE than the sum of the parts! 

Likewise, Dr. Klatz is saying, among other things, that 
when you "stack" multiple hormone enhancements in 
conjunction with Hgh enhancements you get a synergistic 
effect such that each hormone helps maximize the 
effectiveness of the other. 

Put another way, if for example you are enhancing Hgh 
levels but are hypo-thyroid and low in progesterone 
testosterone, you might well be less then excited with 
the results! 

Through hormonal salivary tests, and hormonal symptom 
surveys, you can determine accurately what other hormones 
you might need to enhance, and if your enhancement 
strategies are working and working safely. 

Cycling is an all together different matter, but certainly 
no less important. Cycling refers to the strategy of 
intermittent utilization of hormone therapies. That is 
rest periods are spaced periodically in the enhancement 
schedule. This is a vital practice as the body always 
tends to "up or down regulate" levels of hormones, enzymes 
and such. With actual hormone replacements a negative feed 
back loop occurs which tends to diminish endogenous 
production and down regulate endogenous sensitivity. 
Indeed this is the mechanism by which some one gets "used" 
to smoking or drinking hard liquor. 

Releasers, precursors and secretagogues all have the 
potential of overwhelming the enzyme, co-enzyme and 
substrate complexes of the related hormones production 
systems. 

The usual recommendation for DHEA and melatonin is 4 or 5 
days on and 2 or 3 days off. 

The sex hormones estrogen, progesterone and tesosterone 
precursors and releasers are often cycled 3 weeks on and 
one week off. 

Some use the products from day 1 to 24 of the month, then 
start again on the first. With transdermal progesterones, 
two weeks on and two weeks off is often sufficient, 
especially after the first three months. 

For those seeking maximum results, testoterone and HGH 
enhancers may be taken in a double dose the first week 
after the one week rest period. 

Without proper cycling the initial results of HRT will 
disappear as "the body gets used to it". With proper 
cycling, and occasional remonitoring of levels by 
salivary testing, you can be assured you are maintaining 
the hormonal levels of youth. By attaining and maintaining 
such levels, along with optimal antioxidant status, normal 
cortisol "stress hormone" levels, and normal and responsive 
insulin levels, you are creating the optimal physiological 
state for a maximum health-span and maximal longevity!
