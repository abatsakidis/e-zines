        Well, summer is definitely here! I hope you are all 
enjoying the sunshine. Personally, I could do with a little 
less humidity... but it's better than snow. :)

	We've got some terrific articles for you again this 
month. Timely, interesting, and helpful information provided 
by Your Life-Your Choice professionals. For the information of 
all our readers, almost all of these articles are written 
especially for Your Life-Your Choice... especially for YOU! 
That means that you won't find this information anywhere else! 
So tell your friends to subscribe today. I don't think I say 
Thank You often enough to all of our writers.

	I recently came across this program that I think many 
of you may be interested in. It's called "eDiets" and is 
accessed completely online. Each members diet is individualized
based on a profile you fill out. What impressed me is that it 
takes into consideration any health issues, special diets 
(like Diabetes or cholesterol for example), and any medication 
you may be taking. It also offers you a choice of meal plans 
for busy lifestyles or for those who like to spend more time 
cooking. Members also receive online support. It seems to be very thorough and I can't believe how reasonably priced! 
Here's what some people are saying:

"I feel better. I have never been so healthy in my life...This 
is my 4th week and still going....C'mon....its actually kind of
fun."

"My program really is customized for me! I was skeptical at 
first, but it's simple to follow, the online meetings are neat,
and it's working. I'm a believer"
-Karen
P.S. I love my personal shopping list"

By the way, you get a new shopping list each week and you can 
reuse them long after you finish the program. It's well worth 
the visit! Check out eDiets for yourself!

Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

        I had knee surgery a year and a half ago and always 
felt a bit of pain. I had to wear a knee support and didn't 
have good circulation in my legs and heels. After taking White
Oak and Yucca for two weeks I don't feel any pain anymore, and 
I now have good circulation.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

        I have a story that I just have to tell! Misty, my 2 
year old German Shepherd was in a car accident. My dog is like
a child to me, there's nothing I wouldn't do for her. In this 
accident her foot was crushed beyond repair. After 2 weeks I 
was told to either put her down or remove her leg. I couldn't 
bring myself to do either of these until I had exhausted all 
other options. I gave her White Oak, Echinacea, and Gingko. 
Now she is running and back to the way she was before the 
accident. The vet was speechless, and I'm thrilled to have my 
dog back happy and healthy.

----------

Common Names;	Cleavers, Clivers, Goosegrass, Clives. 

Parts used;	Dried aerial parts

Constituents;	Glycoside asperuloside, gallontannic acid,
		citric acid.

Actions;	Diuretic, alterative, anti-inflammatory, 
		tonic, astringent, anti-neoplastic, 
		anti-scorbutic. 

Energy;		Cool

Flavour;	Bitter

Cleavers is one of the most effective diuretics and 
alteratives we have. It can be used to treat many different 
conditions including hepatitis, venereal disease, enlarged 
lymph glands, cystitis, psoriasis, tonsillitis, adenoid 
problems, ulcers and tumours. It is possibly the best tonic to
the lymphatic system available. This is very important, as 
blood feeds lymph, and lymph feeds the cells. The lymph system
is also the back alley garbage collection system of the 
circulatory system. Well organized lymph drainage results in a
quick acquired immunity response, and cleans up the debris 
when tissues need innate immunity response, such as with a 
bruise. 

In southern Ontario, Cleavers is ready to be harvested about 
this time. It is best to pick it before in comes into flower 
which is usually around the middle to the end of May. It can 
be found growing in shady places, thickets.

It is very easy to identify. It is an annual, has a very weak 
drooping stalk, that is raspy and trails along the ground or 
through other plants. The leaves are lance-shaped, usually 
with eight petals in whorls. The flowers are very small and 
white and you need to look very close to see them. 

Cleavers also makes an excellent vegetable. It can be juiced 
as well. According to the late Dr. Fox of England, a well 
known and very highly successful botanic practitioner, states;
"We have ordered the expressed juice mixed with linseed meal 
to be applied to the breast, with a teaspoonful of the juice 
to be taken fasting in the morning, and this plan after a 
short time has removed indolent tumours in the breast. The 
expressed juice is also good to be applied to sore nipples and
green wounds. It exercises great control over diseases of the 
skin. We have given in tablespoonful doses the expressed juice
three times a day and have never seen it fail in the most 
desperate cases."



Combinations;  

For the lymphatic system it will combine well with Poke Root, 
Echinacea, and Marigold.

For skin conditions it will combine well with the Docks,  Yellow Dock and Burdock. 


Preparation and Dosage;

Infusion; 
Pour a cup of boiling water over two to three teaspoons of 
dried herb and leave to infuse for ten to fifteen minutes. 
This tea should be drunk three times a day.

Tincture; 
Two to four millilitres of the tincture three times a day. 

Compress;
Soak a pad in the infusion and use for burns, grazes, ulcers, 
and other skin inflammations.

Cream;
Use regularly to relieve psoriasis. 

Hair Rinse;
Use the infusion for dandruff or scaling scalp problems.

----------

        Mid springtime. Summer just a few weeks away. What a 
glorious time of year! Here, the green lawn is filled with 
yellow heads of dandelions and white puffs of poplar cotton 
waft in the breeze across the front yard. In the woods behind 
me I see the orange flash of the male oriole and the sweet 
little phoebe flycatcher wags his tail as he perches in the 
sumac tree.  On my porch, the rose-breasted grosbeaks, 
nuthatches, goldfinches and chickadees take turns swiping the 
sunflower seeds on the little table, interrupted only when 
Ruby, the mother red squirrel, leaves her nest box to grab a 
bite while her little brood snoozes. These are the welcome 
winged ones but alas there are others who are not so 
appreciated. Yes - the mosquitoes, sandflies, deer flies and 
various stinger-equipped beasties are here as well.

        What to do? Well, you can spray yourself with horrible
chemicals with names like "Bug Kill", Attack" and "Buss-Off" 
or you could take a kinder approach for both you and the 
"little nuisances". As the old saying goes "An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure", so let's start with some
excellent essential oils that will help to avert pain, sting 
and itch before they become a nasty reality.  

        First of all, let's protect our environment from these 
pesky insects. Using lemongrass or citronella oil in rooms is 
quite effective. Allow these oils to be airborne by using any 
of the following:  steam bowls, heat sources, treated paper 
strips at windows and scent or light bulbs. You can also use a
clean spray bottle with lemongrass or citronella diluted in water and spray this around the room.  Lavender oil can be 
directly applied to exposed areas of skin.

        Try this recipe for "Deterrent Synergistic Blend"

Thyme		4 drops         
Lemongrass	8 drops          
Lavender	4 drops  
Peppermint	4 drops
Make up a good supply and place two drops of the blend on a 
cotton wool ball or tissue and set it beside the bed. 

        You can also use the above blend to prepare a body rub 
by adding two drops of the mixture to one dessert spoon of oil
or add the neat oils to creams or lotions you already have on 
hand.

        Did you know that ankles are a particularly vulnerable
area for attack by mosquitoes and sandflies? The next time you
go for a leisurely stroll in the woods or along the beach, 
wear cotton socks that have been treated with a drop of 
lavender or citronella oil around the top of each sock.

        Now what if the inevitable happens - the dreaded bite 
or sting? First of all, a disinfectant wash is both soothing 
and a preventative against infection. 
 
Disinfectant Wash Synergistic Blend:

Lavender	10 drops (2)    
Thyme		20 drops (2)    
Eucalyptus	10 drops (2)
Use 8 drops of the blend in a bowl of water for washing.  If 
you don't have the blend already prepared, use the number of 
drops in the brackets beside each oil in a single bowl of 
water.

        For bee, hornet or wasp stings try first to remove the
whole stinger. Then apply a cold compress of chamomile oil to 
the area and leave for several hours. Then use one drop of 
neat chamomile oil three times a day for two days. Lavender 
oil can be used neat on mosquito bites. Cedarwood oil has a 
clean, woodsy scent and is effective as an insect repellent.  

        Well there you are! No need to fear the buzz and hum 
of those outdoor (and indoor) bugs.  Fire up the barbecue, 
follow that forest trail and kick up sand along the beach - 
essential oils are with you, all the way.

Section 7          WANNA LIVE TO BE 100? (Part II)
                     The Theories of Aging: 101 

                         by Dr. J.H. Maher
                   Editor of the "Longevity News" 
            your FREE at home study course in anti-aging.
                http://www.galaxymall.com/health/lri 
-----

There are many theories of aging. But to keep things easy 
we will start withe two basic categories; oxidation reactions 
and sub-optimal hormone levels.

Oxidation reactions occur when the combustion of oxygen that 
keep us alive and produces by-products called oxygen free radicals. When this process occurs in metals we call it 
rusting. When it happens in us we call it aging!

Free radicals are molecules that have lost an electron. When 
this happens to oxygen, we call it "singlet oxygen" because it
has only one of its electrons left. This is a highly unstable 
condition. To restore balance the radical either tries to 
steal one electron away from , or donate the remaining one, 
to another nearby molecule. In so doing, the free radicals 
create "molecular mayhemm", disrupting, damaging and 
destroying nearby cells. If DNA is involved, mutations 
occur, a favored theory of a common cause of cancer. In time, 
free radical damage accumulates, thereby aging us.

Free radicals are not only produced inside us, but we take 
them in through smoking, food, air and  water pollution, 
x-rays, sun exposure, and various poisons to name the most 
common.

"Aging is a disease. The human life span simply reflects the 
level of free radical oxidative damage that accumulates in 
cells. When enough damage accumulates, cells can't survive 
properly anymore and they just give up."
	E.R. Stadtman, researcer on aging, NIH.

The other major theoretical cause of aging in this brief, 
introductory overview is sub-optimal hormone levels. As we 
age some hormones begin a precipitous decline that stongly 
paralells the onset of aging signs and symptoms. These 
include human growth hormone, melatonin, DHEA, androstene- 
dione (made famous by Mark McQuire), testosterone, estrogen, 
and progesterone.

Conversly, insulin levels tend to rise, eventually culminating 
in adult onset diabetes. A relative rise in cortisol, the 
stress hormone, is all too common as well.
 
Although thyroid hormone doesn't generally fall with age, 
many anti-aging doctors insist that slow thyroid function is 
common, and when present, definitely hastens aging and heart 
disease. 

Human Growth Hormone, aka HGH, as the name implies, stimulates
the growth of our tissues. Our internal organs, skin, muscles,
nerves and bones are all stimulated to grow by HGH. As our 
levels of growth hormone shrinks, so do we!

Melatonin helps us sleep and may help prevent cancer. One 
reason why people over 60 sometimes find it hard to go to 
sleep is declining melatonin levels. DHEA is a building 
block out of which estrogen and testosterone are made. (It 
is first converted to androstenedione, however.) DHEA also 
boosts are immune systems and our brains. 

Testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone give us our sex 
drive, build muscle, skin and bone, keep our minds sharp, 
protect our hearts, and help us feel and be attractive.

Thyroid hormone helps keeps us energetic and trim. Along with 
the above hormones, it helps us burn fat. That spare tire that 
developes around our bellies at middle age (central obesity) 
has alot to do with lower hormone levels. That may be why your
last diet didn't work!

Excess insulin levels are associated with diabetes, 
pre-diabetes, and the mysterious sounding "Syndrome X". When 
insulin no longer works well, known as insulin resistance, 
both insulin and then blood sugar rise. The excess blood sugar 
is forced into the body's tissues, damaging them with 
"advanced glycation end-products", known as "AGE" 
appropriately enough!

Cortisol levels, like insulin levels, don't decline with age. 
Excess levels of this stress hormone is catabolic. That means 
it catabolises you, or literally "eats you up inside". 

When cortisol and insulin are too high, they often lower Hgh, 
DHEA, and the sex hormones as well!
 
(End Part II? If so, then "Next issue we will introduce the 
basic outline to a scientific anti-aging program based on the 
above theories of aging")
