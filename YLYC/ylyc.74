Letter From the Editor

Many women increase their calcium intake, unaware that
the body also requires magnesium. The body keeps the two
minerals in balance, therefore increasing one without
increasing the other really does not have any real benefit
as the body simply disposes of the excess.  Optimally
one should consume 1,000 milligrams of each per day.
However, your intake should increase with age.  After
menopause the recommended daily allowance is 1,500
milligrams.  Remembering always to have that balancing
component. McMaster University researchers have recently
reported the importance of pregnant women increasing their
calcium intake to 1,500 to 2,000 mg per day. The results of
their study indicated that this could reduce the risk of
pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre- eclampsia;
two of the highest levels of concern in pregnancies,  by 70%
and 60% respectively.

"60-70 percent of American women are magnesium deficient."
Says Barbara from the Cornell Medical Center. "For women who
take calcium supplements and eat a calcium-rich  diet, it's probably
a good idea to take magnesium and eat magnesium-rich foods,
too."  Some caution should be taken to ensure that the calcium
magnesium levels don't get too high.  Elevated levels may lead
to diarrhea.  Whole grain breads, fortified cereals, leafy
vegetables, kale, broccoli, tofu, soybeans, low fat chees, milk
and yogurt are good choices when trying to achieve a proper
balance.

In addition to maintaining healthy teeth and bones, calcium has
a number of other functions. Blood coagulation, transmission of
nerve impulses, muscle contraction and relaxation, normal heart
beat, stimulation of hormone secretion, and activation of enzyme
reactions all require certain amounts of calcium.  The bones in
the human body incorporate calcium into their structure and,
like all tissues in the body, are continually being reabsorbed
and reformed.

Until next time... the best of health to you,

              Rolfing - The whole body approach to wellbeing
              By Megan Arnel- Certified Rolfing Practitioner
                                  meganarnel@hotmail.com

What is Rolfing ?

Rolfing is the nickname given to a form of body work and
movement education pioneered from the work of Dr. Ida Rolf.
She called it 'structural integration', which is a process of
realigning the body through soft tissue manipulation. Through
ageing, gravity, emotional stress, previous injuries and poor
posture our bodies can become out of balance. This can translate
in our posture as loss of energy, decrease in flexibility,
backache, headache and general aches and pains. After balancing
the body through Rolfing it enables us to function at a much
higher level of efficiency and ease. People who have experienced
Rolfing often report a feeling of lightness, fluidity, increased
breathing capacity, more energy and elimination of chronic pain.
Structural Integration is a system that induces change toward an
ordered pattern. It aims to balance the myofascial relationships
within the body. When the body becomes more aligned through
Rolfing, the posture can become taller, straighter and free from
chronic pain. A body that is more balanced and aligned with
gravity, the lower its entropy and the greater its energy
content. Rolfers believe that we need to look at and address the
body as a whole rather than separate parts.

How does Rolfing work?

Fascia or connective tissue completely surrounds every joint,
muscle , bone and organ and it gives shape and strength to our
body. Hardened or shortened areas in this fascial web are caused
by repeated patterns of use such as the way we walk, sit, stand
or sleep as well as deep seated emotional patterns. In healthy
fascia its smooth coating permits neighbouring structures to
slide over one another. However, following inflammatory
illnesses or traumatic illness, poor posture or emotional
stress, layers adhere to one another and become 'glued'
together. They will no longer slide and work as they should,
making the body work a lot harder to function contributing to
weariness and tension. Imbalances in the fascia occur where the
stress is greatest, negatively affecting our body's shape and
movement patterns. Our shoulders can become more rounded, our
necks too far forward, rotations and twists in our pelvis and
torso or slumping in our posture. You may begin to feel less
flexible and less able to move freely as you once did. Pain is
often the result. Rolfing works to release these holding
patterns and to restore movement and alignment.

Who benefits from Rolfing?

People come to Rolfing for many different reasons, some seek
relief from chronic pain and stiffness, others want a better
performance from their bodies in sport, yoga, dance or
meditation. Many desire a better posture and being able to sit
up straight and walk tall without much physical effort and
strain. Some clients may seek more flexibility , mobility and a
better understanding of their posture and body through
awareness. Still others come to Rolfing to grow emotionally and
to reach their fullest potential. People from all walks of life
and all ages come to experience Rolfing integration for both
physical relief and to improve their performance in their daily
lives, professions and activities.

The Rolfing session

After a thorough evaluation of the clients structure and
movement patterns, the Rolfer uses his or her hands to gently
loosen and lengthen fascial sheaths surrounding specific muscles
and joints. Health is restored to over worked tissues as the
body becomes more organised in the vertical line and no longer
strains to keep itself upright within gravity. The Rolfing
process is one of exploration, awareness, education and change.
Clients are encouraged to participate in their own healing
process by accessing their bodies inner memory of what it is to
be aligned and balanced.

How does Rolfing feel?

Sensations in the area being worked on vary from pleasurable
warmth to momentary discomfort. How you will feel during the
Rolfing session depends on several factors such as injuries to
the area, or tension caused by chronic stress. Chronic pain
often disappears immediately after the session or soon after the
series. The Rolfing practitioner will work with you and your
level of comfort to achieve the best results.

The Rolfing Series

Rolfing is typically applied in an initial series of ten
sessions. Sessions are scheduled anywhere between one week and
three weeks apart and each session is one and a half hours
duration. Each session does have specific goals to achieve,
however Rolfing is a very personal process and as no two people
are alike sessions will vary slightly for differing individuals
and needs. The results of Rolfing are cumulative and lasting,
each session builds upon the last session to align the entire
body and to get the best results that are lasting. Often
photographs taken many years after the initial ten sessions
still show that changes made during Rolfing are lasting and that
the structure has improved even moreover time. Follow up work
may consist of occasional tune up sessions.

                           Tea Bags or Tea Leaves?

When shopping for tea many of us wonder which has the best taste
and benefits, tea bags? or tea leaves? Tea leaves have been used
and enjoyed for centuries, their benefits and taste are
wonderful, then in  the 1900s, a gentleman made up tea bags as a
free promotion to sell his tea, a huge success story. In the tea
business, the bags contain what they call "tea dust' or
"fannings", the taste is lost by inferior quality leaves, the
benefits to health is diminished. The answer then, is to buy tea
leaves to get the best flavour and health benefits, black tea,
green tea, herbal tea, the list is endless, a tea lovers
delight. Remember to store your precious leaves in a cool dry
place, not in your fridge or freezer, and enjoy.

                 Anti-Oxidants Galore!
                                by Dr. John 
Maher
                               drjmaher@cts.com 

                    http://www.RxforWellness.com

Natural sources of antioxidants, such as Vitamins C and E and
beta carotene, are some of your best defenses against
coronary-pulmonary aging. Choose from these foods when eating
at least five servings per day of fruits and vegetables, better yet
9 servings:

Vitamin C: red pepper, brussels sprouts, papaya, orange,
chestnuts, butternut squash, kiwi, strawberries, cantaloupe,
kale, pink grapefruit, sweet potato, cabbage, broccoli, and
cauliflower. {The latter 3 also help the liver detoxify poisons
and "bad" estrogens (16-hydroxyestrone) that promote breast,
colon, cervical and prostate cancer.}

Vitamin E: almonds, spinach, parsnips, peanut butter, sunflower
seeds, asparagus, sweet potato, wheat germ, brussels sprouts,
peanuts, pecans.

Beta carotene: carrot, butternut squash, cantaloupe, sweet
potato, kale, watercress, apricot, red pepper, turnip greens,
mango.

A good rule of thumb: eat from the fruit and vegetable "color
palette" each day and include red, green, orange, and yellow.

By the way, eating lots of anti-oxidants keeps your lungs
strong. The proof? According to a 3/14/98 article in the FASEB
Journal, people who ate the most antioxidants were able to
exhale almost 1/2 cup more air in 1 second than people who ate
much less. The ability to inhale and exhale volumes of air is
called "Vital Capacity" and is perhaps the best physical exam
indicator of life expectancy!**

And need I remind you that lung cancer is the #1 cancer killer?
AND 18% of VICTIMS NEVER SMOKED!

So eat your 9 servings of a rainbow variety of fruits, seeds,
nuts and vegetables. Then take a professional quality
multi-vitamin/mineral with at least 1000mg Vit C, 100 IU Vit E,
and 15,000 units of mixed carotenoids (not just beta-carotene),
and 200mcg of selenium. As iron is a pro-oxidant, it should not
be included usually except in the anemic, childrens formulas and
for menstrating or pregnant females*.

Pregnant females and those desiring or even "at risk" for
pregnancy should limit Vit A supplementation to less than 5,000
units a day.
