Letter From the Editor

There's an increasing amount of focus these days on omega 3 
and omega 6 oils. In fact, June Kaminski has a very interesting 
article in our newsletter today discussing how these oils can 
affect mental health… a definite MUST READ. In fact omega 
3 and omega 6 oils are instrumental in a number of health issues 
including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, heart disease, immune 
system weakness, mental disorders, attention deficit, and skin 
problems. Over 2,000 scientific studies have confirmed 
numerous health problems associated with Omega-3 deficiencies. 
Because our bodies cannot produce polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(omega 3 and omega 6) we must consciously add these to our 
diets. 

There is, however, important information about these oils that 
is not commonly addressed. As more and more attention is being 
placed on EFAs (Essential Fatty Acids) and their diverse health 
benefits, it becomes increasingly crucial that you are aware of 
that in-depth information. 

Omega 3 works best when taken in combination with omega 6. 
However, care must be taken to consume a correct ratio of both. 
In fact, a severe imbalance can leave you prone to chronic 
diseases. It is estimated that 60% of North Americans consume 
much more Omega 6 than is required and 95% of North 
Americans are lacking in the consumption of Omega 3. 
Although omega 6 is necessary, too much of it disrupts the 
efficiency of Omega 3, and can actually be harmful. Because 
of the changing diets of North Americans and because a 
significant amount of the fish we eat are now being farmed 
as opposed to being born in their natural environment, the 
amount of omega 3 produced in the fish we eat is substantially 
decreased. There is a special ingredient in nature that man 
simply cannot duplicate. Consequently, our diets contain far 
less omega-3s and far more of omega-6s. 

Although the Government of Canada recently recommended 
individuals between the ages of 25-49 should take 1.5 grams 
of Omega 3 fatty acids daily, the average person actually 
consumes less than 20% of this required daily dosage. 
Remembering that balance is important, you should be 
considering a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 no less than 4:1 
(4 times the amount of omega 6 to that of omega 3) and no 
more than 10:1 (10 times the amount of omega 6 to that of 
omega 3). According to Nutrition, Health & Heart Disease, 
about 2 teaspoons of flaxseed, linseed or fish oil, or 2 
tablespoons canola or soy oil is a recommended amount of 
omega 3. The NIH (National Institute of Health) and the 
NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) have 
seen numerous studies involving doses ranging from 3 grams
to 15 grams of omega 3 per day and acknowledge the health
benefits of incorporating this essential fatty acid into
a daily diet. 

If you decide to enhance your diet with omega 3 through 
supplementation, I encourage you to choose flaxseed or 
linseed oil. These are both very high in omega 3. Fresh 
fish oil is also a good choice, but it could be much higher 
in calories depending on the type of fish.

        Fatty Acids can Protect Your Mental Health
                by  June Kaminski, RN MSN

There are many causes linked to poor mental health. Some
experts believe mental health breakdown is influenced by
genetics, upbringing, traumatic experiences, stress, brain
chemistry, exposure to chemical toxins, nutritional deficits
and so on. The actual reason why some people develop
mental health problems is not perfectly clear. However,
research does indicate a strong link between nutrition and
some mental health problems. Study results show that
people can help preserve their mental health by choosing
to eat in a balanced and knowledgeable way. In our
stressful, fast-paced world, keeping yourself sane and
whole is both wise and recommended.

Essential Fatty Acids and Mental Health

Several distinct research studies have found that particular
essential fatty acids (EFAs) are mandatory for normal brain
function.  Although fats have gotten a lot of bad press in 
recent years, there are important nutrients that must be 
regularly included in any healthy diet. Particular interest 
has developed in Omega-3 and Omega-6 essential fatty acids
and phospholipids. Serious mental health problems including
Depression, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and
Manic-Depression seem more predominant in people who
are chronically deficit in these two EFAs. Although not seen
as the sole reason for these mental health disorders, this new
research does show promise in their prevention and treatment.

We now know that the brain is about 60 per cent fat. It stands
to reason then, that fat in the diet is important. But the
usual diet, abundant in saturated fats is not the answer.
It is crucial to eat unsaturated fats on a regular basis.
Not only for the brain, but for our nerves as well.
Cold-pressed vegetable oils such as safflower, sunflower
seed and olive oil are all important for the nerves, as well
as our skin, hair, and cell repair abilities. The type of fat
needed for the brain comes from another source. The
easiest way to ingest more of the Omega fatty acids and
phospholipids is to regularly eat fish oils and certain fish
such as sardines.

Are You Deficient in EFAs?
Dr. Charles Bates identified several predisposing factors
that give you a higher risk for EFA deficiencies. Some of
these factors include:
* Celtic, Irish, Scandinavian, Welsh, Scottish or Native
  American ancestry
* Family history of alcoholism, depression, suicide,
  schizophrenia, anxiety
* Family history of Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis,
  or irritable bowel syndrome
* Family history of hepatic cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis,
  atopic eczema, diabetes
* History of premenstrual syndrome
* Winter depressions that improve in the Spring
* Unusual reaction and low tolerance to alcohol
* Anxiety or depression after alcohol consumption
* Emotional lift with ingestion of certain foods and vitamins
People who are at a higher risk for EFA deficiency should
ensure that their daily diet includes unsaturated vegetable
and fish oils, as well as regular selections of fish. Even if
you are not at risk, it is wise to include these nutrients in
your diet to protect your brains functioning, your nervous
system, and your mental health. A little dose of prevention
can go a long, long way!

More Than 50% of North American Are Fat and Frustrated
                   by Brigitte Synesael

Interestingly, North American’s pride themselves on having 
the best health care system in the world. Over the last 
few decades, society has become well educated on the health 
risks of obesity.

North American’s have spent in excess of $10 Billion dollars
on diet and exercise programs. Yet still over 50% of the 
North American population is overweight. A large percentage 
of those overweight have lost hundreds of pounds over a period
of time, only to gain it all back.

Too many people remain (at the risk of being rude) fat and 
frustrated. Why, in this age of technology and information,
is obesity still an issue? There are certainly plenty of 
appetite suppressants on the market, and there’s no shortage 
of diet books to tell us every possible method of cutting 
calories. There’s an exercise facility on almost every street 
corner. Are there THAT many people with no willpower?

Not at all! If you’re one of these people you will likely fit 
the following profile:

For most of your life you have been on a diet of some sort.
You have modified your eating habits to accommodate almost 
every new diet hoping that this will be the one. Even though 
you really don't snack anymore you still feel guilty with 
even the slightest indulgence of food. Although you have 
successfully lost many pounds over the years, they have 
historically found their way back to your hips and brought 
along a few friends. You've spent a fortune on diet books, 
diet aids, and diet programs, and special diet foods that 
either haven't worked at  all or you've  lost weight only 
for a short period of time.

By now you're feeling like you are doomed to a life of 
obesity, and you are likely experiencing some depression 
or low self-esteem. If you are one of the many people who 
fit this profile you should consider that there is a very 
real possibility that your weight may have nothing to do 
with excess eating.

Among several possibilities, especially if you’ve been on 
several diets, is the fact that your digestive system may 
not be functioning properly.

The whole digestive process is very complex and involves
numerous organs. One of the functions of the digestive
system is to absorb unnecessary fats and eliminate them
through regular bowel movements. Increasing your fibre
intake can help keep your digestive system working smoothly.
Nutritionists recommend  25 to 35 grams of fiber a day.

There are two different types of fibre; soluble and insoluble.
Both are necessary for optimum health. You can find soluble
fibre in: psyllium husks, flax meal, oat bran, guar gum, 
apple pectin, oranges, rice bran, legumes, and barley.

Insoluble fibre is found in: wheat bran, corn bran, bananas,
brown rice, nuts, strawberries, raspberries, cereals, 
asparagus, celery, root vegetables, and fruit peels.

Fibre supplements are readily available in health food 
stores and can be helpful in ensuring your daily intake. 
However, remember as you choose your fibre supplement to 
watch for both soluble and insoluble fibre for optimum 
health.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because of the way that fibre works,
it is an absolute MUST that you also drink 8-10 glasses of
water every day. Fibre NEEDS water to complete it’s function.
Increasing your fibre intake without drinking the water will
simply be adding to your digestive problem.

A great tip is to drink water at room temperature
or slightly cooler.You can consume higher volumes
of room temperature water than you can of ice cold
or refrigerated water. This is not to say that cold water
is bad for you. There is nothing wrong with ice or cold
water. Many people have difficulty drinking the required
8-10 glasses per day. This tip is to help you drink more,
allowing you to achieve that goal.

A bonus of both adding the recommended amount of fibre
and water to your diet is that it provides you with a full
feeling, thereby acting as an appetite suppressant.

             PRESCRIPTION FOR ASPIRING CENTENARIANS
                       by Dr. John Maher

The average life expectancy today is almost 80 years. According
to a recent report in "Science" magazine, if Americans could
avoid the major causes of death, which are diabetes, stroke,
cancer, and heart disease life expectancy would jump to
991/2 years overnight.

FIVE TIPS FOR ASPIRING CENTENARIANS

1. Avoid adult onset diabetes by exercising, maintaining ideal
body weight, and avoiding sweet, empty, fatty, refined, starchy
foods. 
Benefit: add 1.4 years


2. As 90% of cancer is curable if caught at the earliest stage,
have early detection tests regularly. 
Result: add 3 years to your life.

3. Keep homocysteine levels normal by adding vitamin B5,
B6, B9, and B12, and Vit. C to your heart disease prevention
program. Add magnesium and antioxidants to keep your
arteries strong and flexible. Keep your arteries unclogged,
prevent stroke, and keep your blood pressure down through
proper diet, weight control, and stress reduction. 
Result: add 2 more years to your life.

4. Prevent heart disease by keeping your total cholesterol
below 200, your LDL cholesterol below 150, and your HDL
above 45. Do 15 minutes minutes of strength training and 30
minutes of aerobic exercise 3-4 times per week. After age
40, have yearly cardiovascular screening tests. 
Result: A gain of 13 years to your potential life span.

THE ELIMINATION OF THESE DISEASES WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY MAKE YOU A CENTENARIAN.

5. OH yes.If you want to make it past 100, drive a car that
weighs more than 3500 lbs. and buckle up every time you
get behind the wheel!

Section 5.           Talk to Garlic

Dear Garlic,

I love chicken stir fried rice. I order it whenever I can from
a Chinese restaurant. Yet it seems like every time I make it
for myself at home, I end up with soggy rice, that really
bothers me. I don't know what I am doing wrong.?!?. I am
wondering if you have any advice for me. I use normal whole
grain brown rice that you can buy at the grocery store, maybe
this is the problem? All I know is it is getting too expensive 
for me to keep ordering such a simple meal that could easily 
be made at home. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You
"Sogged" out and sick of it!


Dear Sogged:

Oh my heavens girlfriend, your life is over. How do you
expect to catch a man if something as basic as rice has
you sogged out? Ya gotta keep in mind the way to a
mans' heart is thru his stomach!!!

A venerable Chinese gentleman (the owner of a Chinese
food supply store) told me the secret to great stir 
fried rice.

Now listen up Grasshopper!!!. Just cook the rice 
(do not use minute rice, long grain rice only) according 
to package instructions and put it in the fridge early 
in the am or even better, the night before. Make sure it 
gets cold.

Add to the stir fry at the last moment and voila, 
great rice.  You know something, the ancient was
100% right. Now just as a special treat, add some
Chinese vegetables to your stir fry, bok choy,
bean sprouts, etc. Also add a couple of fried eggs
for flavor and protein. Some celery, onions, water
chestnuts and go. Enjoy.(remember to stir fry on
high temperature and keep turning constantly for
a few seconds til ready to eat. (use peanut oil)

Ancient Chinese Secret:  
She who stir rice in kitchen, 
stir passion fruit in bedroom!!!
