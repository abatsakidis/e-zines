			TEA TIPS
		Teas Help to Ward Off Cancer 
Studies are showing that green and black tea contain cancer 
fighting antioxidants. The teas come from the same leaf, 
Camellia sinensis, but are processed differently. Researchers 
believe that this tea gets its disease fighting properties from 
polyphenols, especially one called epigallocatechin gallate, or 
EGCG. This EGCG neutralizes potentially cell damaging free 
radicals in the body. Decaffeinated versions of this tea also 
have these cancer-fighting properties.

		Massage and Fibromyalgia
		by Christina Barrett
		mailto:cbr@glinx.com	

Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by unrelenting 
flu-like symptoms, continuous achiness of the entire body, 
sleep disturbances and specific tender points on the body. 
There are quite a few very good sites on the Internet that 
provide information on the diagnosis and treatment of 
fibromyalgia. However, right now, I am going to discuss 
the effects of massage as a treatment for this distressing 
condition.

Sleep disturbance is one of the biggest of the contributing 
factors to fibromyalgia. Most medication that is prescribed 
is to help sufferers sleep better. I have found that massage 
is frequently helpful in this regard. Most frequently, my 
clients who have this require a gentler, more relaxing type 
of treatment. They find that this helps them to sleep at night.
 
Often, chronic pain causes the person suffering it to tighten 
up against the pain. My understanding is that this creates a 
feedback loop, wherein the tight muscles make circulation 
difficult, which deprives the muscles of necessary oxygen 
and nutrients. In turn, this deprivation makes the muscles 
tighten up, and the loop goes on. 

Massage therapy can loosen the muscle fibers, increase 
local circulation, and help to restore a more relaxed 
resting tone. What this means in practical terms for the 
person on the receiving end, is they are able to function 
a bit better when they don't feel as if their entire body is 
clenched like a fist. Even if the pain relief is only during 
that hour on the massage table, being without pain for even 
that amount of time is often very therapeutic. Sometimes it 
is the first time in months or years that the person has been 
able to relax and rest. Often, clients fall asleep during 
treatment, which is exactly what their body needs.

On the other hand, there are a few who require deeper muscle 
therapy to achieve the relief they seek. One of my clients with 
fibromyalgia is a hairdresser. As you can imagine, she 
frequently has her arms raised as she cuts, does perms, styles 
and so on. In her case, her shoulders are almost always very 
sore, aching and burning. She needs muscle therapy along the 
edges of her shoulder blades and the upper trapezius muscles. 
The treatments are usually very painful while she is receiving 
them, but she assures me the payoff comes the next day or the 
one after when she is able to move without hurting, and can 
sleep at night. 

If you suffer from fibromyalgia and you want to try massage
for it, I recommend talking to the therapist before your first 
treatment. Discuss what you feel most comfortable with. It is 
probably best to start with a gentle, full-body relaxation type 
treatment. Then you and your therapist can work together to 
find what provides you with the most relief.

Remember, YOU are in charge of your body. It is up to you 
to let the therapist know during treatment if something does 
not feel right, or is too painful. Verbal feedback, or an agreed-
on signal to let the therapist know to lighten up or move to 
another area will help keep the session enjoyable and effective.

Happy health.

		The Critical Importance Of Cycling
		     And Stacking In Anti-Aging
		by Dr. John H. Maher, A.B.A.A.H.P.. 
		       Editor, "Longevity News" 
		mailto:subscribe@rxforwellness.com 
	   "Your FREE Anti-Aging Prescription On-line!"



"The most dynamic age reversing effects are seen with an 
integrated program of HRT (hormone replacement therapy), 
antioxidants, exercise, and diet along with HGH or its 
precursors" - R. Klatz,M.D. President of A4M (The American 
Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine). 

Combining many elements together to get a heightened response 
is referred to as "stacking", a term that comes to us from the 
body building community. When "stacked" one on top of the 
other, the effect is synergistic and the result adds up to MORE 
than the sum of the parts! 

Likewise, Dr. Klatz is saying, among other things, that when 
you "stack" multiple hormone enhancements in conjunction with 
Hgh enhancements you get a synergistic effect such that each 
hormone helps maximize the effectiveness of the other. 

Put another way, if for example you are enhancing Hgh levels but 
are hypo-thyroid and low in progesterone testosterone, you might 
well be less then excited with the results! 

Through hormonal salivary tests, and hormonal symptom surveys, 
you can determine accurately what other hormones you might 
need to enhance, and if your enhancement strategies are working 
and working safely. 

Cycling is an all together different matter, but certainly no less 
important. Cycling refers to the strategy of intermittent utilization 
of hormone therapies. That is rest periods are spaced periodically 
in the enhancement schedule. This is a vital practice as the body 
always tends to "up or down regulate" levels of hormones, enzymes 
and such. With actual hormone replacements a negative feed back 
loop occurs which tends to diminish endogenous production and 
down regulate endogenous sensitivity. Indeed this is the mechanism 
by which some one gets "used" to smoking or drinking hard liquor. 

Releasers, precursors and secretagogues all have the potential 
of overwhelming the enzyme, co-enzyme and substrate 
complexes of the related hormones production systems. 

The usual recommendation is for DHEA and melatonin is 4 
or 5 days on and 2 or 3 days off.
 
The sex hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone 
precursors and releasers are often cycled 3 weeks on and one 
week off. Some use the products from day 1 to 24 of the month, 
then start again on the first. With transdermal progesterones, 
two weeks on and two weeks off is often sufficient, especially 
after the first three months. 

For those seeking maximum results, testosterone and HGH 
enhancers may be taken in a double dose the first week after 
the one week rest period. 

Without proper cycling the initial results of HRT will 
disappear as "the body gets used to it". With proper 
cycling, and occasional remonitoring of levels by salivary 
testing, you can be assured you are maintaining the 
hormonal levels of youth. By attaining and maintaining 
such levels , along with optimal antioxidant status, normal 
cortisol "stress hormone" levels , and normal and responsive 
insulin levels , you are creating the optimal physiological 
state for a maximum health-span and maximal longevity!

which compares the prices of 40 bookstores online. I found 
that the online store from my neighbourhood listed the same 
book at $33.95  Cdn  plus $11.00 shipping. Further comparison 
showed that the Best Price was found at Indigo Canada at $17.81 
Cdn plus $4.95 shipping for a grand total of $22.76.

		       Hayfever and Nutrition
		   By: June Kaminski RN MSN 
		mailto:junek@vancouver.quik.com

In the Western hemisphere, Spring is in the air, bringing 
sunshine, new growth and longer daylight hours. Along 
with these uplifting changes comes tree and grass pollens, 
dust, and other triggers that can cause Hayfever or Allergic 
Rhinitis attacks in some people. Common symptoms of 
hay fever include nasal discharge, sneezing, headache, itching 
of the eyes and nose, lethargy, aching teeth, sinus pressure, 
loss of taste and blocked nasal breathing. The inner membrane 
of the nasal passages become swollen and often unbearable. 
The basic medical treatment for hay fever includes 
antihistamines, corticosteroids and guidelines to avoid direct 
contact with the offensive allergens. Sometimes more 
aggressive treatment is used to build up the body's immune 
resistance through the administration of a series of injections 
or oral drops containing minute doses of extracts from the 
particular allergens involved. Recent research indicates that 
certain nutrients and herbs can also be beneficial to hay fever 
sufferers. Adding these natural and complementary aids to the 
diet can provide added ammunition against unpleasant hay fever 
symptoms.

Nutritional Recommendations:

B Vitamins are highly recommended for all allergy sufferers 
including those experiencing hay fever. Although particular 
B vitamins are identified as more valuable than others, it is 
wise to take a balanced B vitamin complex preparation to 
ensure that all of the B vitamins remain balanced in the body. 
Look for a supplement containing Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin 
(B2), Niacin (B3), Pyridoxine (B6), Pantothenic Acid, Folic 
Acid, B12, Biotin, Inositol and Choline in balanced proportions.

Vitamin C (500 mg) combined with Bioflavonoids help to boost 
the immune system and have an anti- inflammatory effect on the 
nasal passages. 

Vitamin A (5,000 to 10,000 IU per day) also boost the immune 
system function and enhance the resilience of the nasal passage 
cells.

Vitamin E (400 IU per day) boosts the elasticity of the nasal 
mucous membrane cells. 

Food Allergy Precautions:

Careful attention to the diet is also warranted during hay fever 
season. People who are allergic to natural substances in the 
environment may also be allergic or sensitive to particular 
foods as well. Make a point of avoiding certain foods such 
as wheat products, eggs, milk and dairy, citrus, chocolate, 
shellfish, nuts and nut butters. 

Herbal Supplement Recommendations:

Ma Huang or Chinese Ephedra provides a natural source of 
ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine which help to constrict the 
sinus blood vessels relieving some of the sneezing, nasal 
pressure, secretion and itchiness. Look for herbal decongestants 
that contain Ephedra. Do be cautious though: use of this 
preparation should be restricted to one week at a time to 
avoid potential central nervous system over stimulation. 

Echinacea and Goldenseal make a fine combination to add 
to the treatment regime for hay fever. Echinacea acts as an 
anti-viral agent while Goldenseal is anti-bacterial which help 
to prevent sinusitis. Goldenseal is also soothing to the throat 
and sinus mucous membranes. These two herbs help to boost 
the immune system and work to release toxic metabolites that 
build up during prolonged allergic responses. 

Licorice Root strengthens the adrenal glands which aids in 
dealing with hay fever reactions. 

Astragalus, another Chinese herb helps to strengthen the body's 
defense system or protective energy to help in the resistance of 
infections. 

Elder Tree Leaves ease congestion and inflammation in hay fever, 
sinusitis and allergic responses. 

Stinging Nettles contains properties that help to relieve allergy 
symptoms including coughs, runny nose and congestion. A 
caution though: pregnant women should refrain from using nettles.

Section 6.

Dear Garlic,

I am a 42 year old woman with an attitude problem.  I 
don't seem to be able to find a man with any semblance 
of intelligence. They all seem to be spoiled rotten, and 
from somewhere believe that they have the brains to 
make my decisions for me. Am I doomed to be alone, 
or is there some way I can become more tolerant. 

Dear Intolerant

Well my dear, you are not the only female with this problem 
and no, you are not doomed to be alone for the rest of your 
days.  First of all, let me remind you who taught these men 
their false feelings of superiority. Usually their mothers. From 
birth to death, women have reinforced these false ideas. We can 
only blame ourselves.

However, I believe I can give you a way to deal with this. Here 
are four phrases to use that work in almost any situation.  

1) Yes, dear
2) You're Right
3) I'm Sorry
4) It will never happen again

Yes this really works.  You don't have to mean it, just say it. 
Your sense of the ridiculous will take you through almost any 
crisis. He will think you really mean it.  Try it, and accept a 
future where you make the decisions, and he will never know 
the difference. You can enjoy his company, his admiration and 
his devotion, and then answer "yes dear" and tune out.  

Like to talk to Garlic? Yes, men are welcome too:
mailto:marketing@life-choices.com
put "Dear Garlic" in Subject line please.

Note that the Dear Garlic segment of Your Life-Your Choice is for 
entertainment purposes only. The advice is intended to tickle your
funny bone so put your Sense of Humor hat on and let's take a look 
at the "lighter side" of life.
After all, laughter is supposed to be the BEST medicine.
