Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

I am a 6'2" man who used to weigh 255 pounds. My wife 
has always been a big promoter of herbs and she always 
encouraged me to try some for weight loss. Frankly, I 
wasn't uncomfortable with my weight, so I just kept 
putting her off. Finally she did convince me that my 
diet was severly lacking in fiber. I had also read a 
great deal about how increasing fiber in your diet can 
deter a great many health issues. So I started incorporating
a good quality fiber into my diet. One year later I had 
a total weight loss of 40 pounds. All this without dieting.
I take my fiber faithfully every day and eat 3 meals a day.
I can honestly say I feel younger and have much more energy.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I have a hiatal hernia and I get heart burn quite severe.
On evening this happened at a friends house. She gave me 
1/2 teaspoon of Elderberry and told me to let it sit under 
my tongue for approximately one minute, then swallow it.
Amazingly it took about 2 minutes and my heart burn totally 
dissapated. I use it all the time now.

Indications;

Boneset is one of our best remedies for the relief of symptoms 
that may accompany influenza. It will relieve the aches and 
pains as well as aid the body in dealing with any fever that 
is present. This herb is invaluable for colds, fevers, flue, 
and asthma.

Most likely the name Boneset was given due to its use in 
Breakbone Fever, or Dengue Fever. The name Joe-Pie Weed was 
given because of the success had by a Native Indian of that 
name in curing fevers with this herb.

A warm infusion, (tea) of this herb will produce diaphoresis, 
(sweating).

In the case of the flue, or most fever, this will raise the 
heat of the body, working with the fever, and increase the 
circulation aiding in the removal of toxins through the 
skin by sweating. Be careful with this as large doses of the 
warm infusion will produce emesis, (vomiting).

Given in a cold infusion, it has wonderful Alterative, 
(general cleanser of the blood), and Tonic properties.
It will relax the stomach and the liver, and aid in the         
secretion of bile which in turn will have a mild laxative 
effect.

Combinations; In the treatment of influenza it will combine 
well with Yarrow, Elder Flowers,  Cayenne and/or Ginger.


Preparation and Dosage;

Infusion;

Pour a cup of boiling water onto 1-2 teaspoons of the dried 
herb and let steep covered for 10 to 15 minutes.
This should be drunk as hot as possible.
When treating flue or fever it should be drunk every half hour.
Care must be taken not to produce emesis!!!


Tincture;

take 2 - 4 ml of the tincture three times a day. (T.I.D.)
This can be taken in a cup of hot water for faster absorption 
and it will also evaporate the alcohol in the tincture.

Section 6   	   Everyday Uses of Essential Oils

			by Jan Blacktopp, R.M.T.

	The use of essential oils in the home can help to 
create an emotionally and physically healthy environment. 
The oils can soothe or stimulate, act as disinfectants, 
deodorants and insect repellents. All essential oils are 
anti-viral, anti-bacterial & anti-fungal.

	The term Aromatherapy literally means inhalation of 
the aroma of a plant extract being used.  In addition, 
these precious oils, composed of molecules small enough to 
penetrate the skins barrier and enter the bloodstream, can 
be applied topically.

        Hippocrates, the father of medicine, said that the 
way to health is to have an aromatic bath & scented massage 
everyday.  As far back as the fourth century B.C. he 
recognized that burning certain aromatic substances offered 
protection against contagious diseases.

        For centuries these precious oils have been used in 
many ways. In the ancient temples, oils were used for 
anointing and religious ceremonies as well as in the healing 
of wounds and burns.  Today in the home, essential oils are 
used to create ambiance & to promote health & healing.

        Around the home there are many different ways 
essential oils can be used safely:

Carpet Freshener
This powder is for all carpet types especially for those 
with pets.

2 cups baking soda           4 tbsp unperfumed talc powder
4 tbsp borax                 20 drops lavender oil
30 drops lemon oil           10 drops cinnamon oil
10 drops pine oil

Sift the dry ingredients together. Mix the oils and add to 
the powder (1 drop at a time) while mixing thoroughly.  
Store in a glass jar. Stir 2 times a day for 3 days before 
using. Sprinkle lightly on the carpet. Leave overnight or 
as long as possible before vacuuming.

Room Sprays
This spray can also be used as an anti-plague medicine.  
If someone is already sick in your house or if visitors 
bring in the old flu bug, this spray will help cleanse 
the environment.

1 spray bottle                     1 cup distilled water
4 drops eucalyptus oil             9 drops lavender oil

Spray mist in the air as an air freshener/deodorizer. This 
may also be used on carpets, curtains, furniture (not good 
wood though) and even in your vehicle. Shake well each time 
you use the spray bottle.

Sleep Well
Place 1 drop of lavender oil on the pillow case just before 
retiring for the night. It will aid in the relaxation process 
and help you to fall asleep easier.

Bubbly Oil Bath
1/4 cup almond or olive oil        1 cup good quality shampoo
4 drops of essential oil
suggestions:  lavender, orange, bergamot or rose

Mix all ingredients together very thoroughly.  Bottle and mix 
several times. Use 2-3 tablespoons to a bath for maximum bubbles.

For Chopping Block/Countertop
1 spray bottle                          3/4 cup distilled water
1/4 cup 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide
5 drops lavender oil

Mix together, if there is any bacteria on countertops or 
chopping block there will be a bubbling action. Rinse after 
it stops. This formula acts as a disinfectant as well as 
leaving your kitchen area smelling fresh.

Air Vent Freshener
Add 2 drops of your favorite essential oil to a cotton ball 
and place on furnace floor vent. As the furnace heats the 
house, the air will circulate with your favorite scent.

Bath Suggestions
These oils are to be added to the bath water after the water 
is at desired amount & temperature.

Anti-viral      3 drops tea tree         3 drops eucalyptus
                3 drops lavender         1 drop thyme

Dry Skin        4 drops chamomile        4 drops geranium
                2 drops patchouli

Oily Skin       5 drops lemon            3 drops ylang-ylang
                2 drops cypress

Relaxing        4 drops chamomile        3 drops lavender
                3 drops ylang-ylang

Euphoria        1 drop lavender          1 drop grapefruit
                2 drops geranium         2 drops ylang-ylang
                2 drops patchouli

One thing to keep in mind is that these precious oils have a 
subtle yet powerful affect on the body. When in doubt, check 
with a professional. Always keep them out of the reach of 
children and do not take essential oils internally unless 
under the direction of a professional Aromatherapist, 
Naturopathic Doctor or Medical Doctor. Caution is advised
during pregnancy and when using with young children.
