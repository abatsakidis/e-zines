                  Letter from the Editor

        Here we are! We've survived the summer, the school 
year has begun, and life is back to normal once more. I hope 
everyone had a terrific summer. Now we can start thinking 
about Christmas! (Oops! I didn't really say that, did I?) :)

    Remember to keep watch in the next couple of months 
for the many new features Your Life-Your Choice will be 
offering... ONLINE SEMINARS!, MESSAGE BOARDS!,
NEWSFEEDS! and lots more!

Remember to check out "eDiets", an online diet program.
Each diet is individualized  based on a profile you fill out.
It takes into consideration any health issues, special diets
(like Diabetes or cholesterol for example), and any medication
 you may be taking. Even most off-line programs don't do this.
It also offers you a choice of meal plans  for busy lifestyles or
for those who like to spend more time  cooking. Members also
receive online support. It seems to be very thorough and I can't
believe how reasonably priced!
 Here are comments that some of you have sent in:

 "I LOVE the eDiet program! Its versatility fits into 
my schedule perfectly."
-Debbie

 "eDiets is terrific! The online support is wonderful. 
I'm already losing weight and I just started 3 weeks 
ago."
-Janice 

 Remember, you get a new shopping list each week and you 
can reuse them long after you finish the program. It's well 
worth the visit! Check out eDiets for yourself!
 (Important Note: expand your email to maximum. If the link

 Section 2          TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

 Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I am a registered nurse and the mother of 2 young children.
13 years ago I was diagnosed as suffering with rheumatoid 
arthritis, and have been on prescription medication ever since. 
I have had periods of relief, but never been in remission. I 
suffered a particularly bad flare-up after the birth of my second 
child.  It was so painful that there were times when I couldn't 
even turn on the tap.

In addition to my medication, I began taking the herb Yucca 
this past April. The first thing I noticed was that I didn't seem 
to need as much of my medication as usual. Gradually I started 
cutting back. Within 3 months my arthritis medicine had run out, 
and I never got it refilled.

My Rheumatologist (who told me that I would be on medication 
for the rest of my life) told me that I was probably in remission. 
It's now 6 months later and I am still symptom free! I don't know 
for certain if I will remain that way, but I believe I will.

 Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I have a terrible problem with varicos veins. They're 
very ugly and and embarrassing. I've considered 
having them striped, but I've heard many negative 
things about that process. I was told that Red Clover 
might help. I trid it and am very pleased with the 
results. I've only been taking it for a couple of weeks, 
but my varicose veins have gone down by 50%. I'm 
convinced that herbs CAN help!

 ----------
Gravel Root-Queen of the Meadow
Eupatorium purpureum

Gravel Root is also known by the name Sweet Joe-Pye-Weed. 
This is not to be confused with Spotted Joe-Pye-Weed, 
Eupatorium maculatum. Eupatorium purpureum has green 
coloured stems that are purple at the leaf nodes.  Eupatorium 
maculatum has purple or purple spotted stems. 

Gravel Root is found growing in thickets, fields, and is quite 
commonly seen on the roadside. It is a perennial, grows from
two to twelve feet high, and has pale pink-purple flowers in a 
rounded cluster. It can be found throughout North America 
and in Europe Spiraea ulmaria (Queen of the Meadow and also 
Meadowsweet) is common. 

Gravel Root is a very valuable herb for conditions relating to the 
urinary tract. It has an influence on the kidneys, bladder and uterus, 
relaxes and gently  stimulates and tones the pelvic viscera. You 
may have guessed that the name Gravel Root was given to this herb 
because of the effect of removing kidney stones and gravel or brick 
dust from the kidneys and bladder, or put another way, of removing 
solids from the urinary tract.

Parts Used; 
It is the root that is commonly used but some Herbalists do use the 
aerial parts.

Energy and Flavour;
Bitter, Pungent, Neutral.

Systems Affected;
Kidney, bladder, stomach and liver.

Biochemical Constituents;
Volatile oil, flavonoids, resin and a yellow flavonoid called euparin.

Actions-Properties;
Diuretic, lithotriptic (dissolves stones), nervine, tonic, anti-rhumatic, 
carminative.

Indications;
Kidney stones and gravel, urinary infections such as cystitis and 
urethritis, systemic treatment of rheumatism and gout, frequent and 
nightime urination (Enurisis), hematuria (blood in urine). 

Combinations;
For kidney stones or gravel it combines well with Parsley, Pellitory 
of the Wall or Hydrangea. 
A good combination for pelvic troubles is Gravel Root, Mitchella 
(Squaw Vine) and Hydrastis (Golden Seal).

It is interesting to note that in the dynamised Homoeopathic form, 
Eupatorium Purpureum is used for very similar physical complaints. 
In addition to the above herbal uses, the homoeopathic remedy can 
help with impotency and infertility as well as uterine atony (lack of 
tone). On the mental level, the potenised remedy (homoeopathic) is 
of great use for homesickness, even if this feeling is had while one is 
at home.

 Section 6         Rose- The Queen of Fragrances
                                by:  Jan Blacktopp, RMT, 
                                   Cert. Aromatherapist

    Summer is winding down.  These carefree days of sun, sand 
and water will soon be just another pleasant memory.  Do you
think that life is passing by too quickly, just like the season?  Well,
there is a solution.  Stop for a moment and smell the ROSES.

    The rose - the most prized of all flowers has been a part of 
our culture and history for many hundreds, if not thousands of
years.  Do you remember the Old Testament story where the 
exotic Queen of Sheba tested the wisdom of King Solomon?
The Queen presented him with two perfect roses, the only 
difference between them was that one was real and the other 
was made of wax.  Solomon was not allowed to touch these 
flowers and so he suggested that they take them to the garden. 
In a short time a bee alighted on the true rose and proceeded 
to search for nectar.  The riddle was solved.

    Roses also figure prominently in songs, poems and even 
wars.  The War of the Roses was a name given to a series of
battles fought by two rival branches of the Plantagenet dynasty 
for control of the English throne in the 15th century.   Each
family had a rose as its emblem - white for the York family, 
red for the House of Lancaster.

    In Victorian times, roses acted as messengers, especially in
"matters of the heart".  Red roses said, "I love you."  White
ones had several meanings: "You're heavenly," reverence and 
humility, innocence and purity and even secrecy and silence.
However, a withered white rose had two sad meanings: fleeting 
beauty and "you made no impression".

    So you see how special the rose is and so it follows that the
fragrant oils of roses would be special as well.  The heavenly
scent of rose does not come cheaply.  In order to make one 
pound of rose oil, five thousand pounds of petals must be
harvested.  One petal picker averages ten pounds per day. 
Also, it is important to note that all roses are not suitable for
extracting essential oils. Bulgaria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey 
cultivate roses which are considered worthy of the price. 
Look for oils made from "real rose" plants such as Rosa 
damascena, Rosa centifolia or Rosa gallica.

    So much for history.  Now for the practical suggestions 
on how to use your precious oil.
* For a very beneficial psychological effect place 1 to 2 drops 
in an aroma lamp to change the room's atmosphere

* To relieve migraines, mix rose oil and balm oil: also both rose 
and balm oils undiluted will help heal shingles

* To calm a nervous heart, apply a chest rub of one drop of 
undiluted oil daily

* For a mild massage oil and to promote skin comfort for babies 
and children, combine 3 1/2 fluid ounces of almond oil, with one 
to two drops of rose oil and one to two drops of Roman chamomile. 
Essential rose oil and rosewood oil mixed in a base oil makes an 
excellent skin lotion.

* Rose oil is rarely taken orally.

    The beneficial effects of rose oil are soothing physically, 
mentally and spiritually.  Not only does it act as an antiseptic,
tonic, cooler and wound healer for the body, it also balances,
encourages patience and love and eases disappointment and
sorrow.

    No wonder this precious gift has been revered and celebrated
throughout the ages.  So go out and hug a rose today and if
you prick your finger on its thorns, just use rose oil to heal the
wound.

Section 7          Dealing With Dental Fears
 
                          by Dr. J.H. Maher
                    Editor of the "Longevity News"
             your FREE at home study course in anti-aging.
                 http://www.galaxymall.com/health/lri
 -----
The following article is an excerpt of the book "Become Your 
Own Dental Consultant" written by Eugenie G. Foret, RN, MA 
and Dr. Jacob Trager, DDS. Reprint permission granted by Dr. 
Jacob Trager.
-----

    If you are experiencing fears about needed dental care, 
it is first important in the process of change, to accept it. In 
other words, allow the fear, acknowledge it and let the fear 
feelings be okay. In the process of change, it is first necessary
to become aware, second to accept the process, and then this 
usually opens your choices. With the choices, comes the 
question:  What would I like to do about these feelings of fear 
I am experiencing? The following are steps you can choose to
take toward change:

1.  The first step is to change your perception of what you are 
experiencing and to begin to look at what you're feeling as 
positive because it is prompting you to explore deeper inside 
of you. Along with changing your perception it is important to 
see this fear as only one part of yourself - not your total self! 
You are not just your fear! You are also ____, ____, and 
____. List all the other things that make you - YOUR This is 
a way of putting the fear in perspective and not allowing it to 
control or overwhelm you. It is also important not to put 
yourself down for having this fear and not to judge you or 
your feelings. Allow and welcome this process with the fear 
as a growth experience for you to discover more about 
yourself. Because if you choose to change, you will grow.

2.  Now with this new perception of your experience, you 
can begin by acknowledging the presence of the fear, then 
accepting its presence. Second, if you don't already know 
what is causing the fear, begin exploring gently within yourself 
to discover what it is that frightens you. Once you've changed 
your perceptions, acknowledged, accepted, and discovered 
what, you've taken positive steps in demystifying the fear 
which is a major accomplishment in helping yourself to change.

3.  Many of our fears are associated with fear of the unknown. 
Examples:  What will they do?  What will happen to me if ____? 
One way of assisting in eliminating this part of the fear cycle is to 
educate yourself on the procedure. This is a very positive step 
towards helping yourself and empowering you.

4.  In the process of educating yourself, you are inviting positive 
images into your mind which begins the process of healing your
emotional self and your body. We usually have non-healing 
images associated with our fear cycles.

5.  If you are fearful due to a prior traumatic dental experience, 
     we suggest the following to work towards a solution:

A.  Talk this experience through with a dentist of your choice 
      and ask that he work with you in creating a new first positive 
      dental experience.
B.  A qualified therapist can assist you in working through the 
     feelings associated with this trauma.
C.  Or you can choose to do both of the above which will enrich 
      your experience and you as a person.

6.  We highly recommend a relaxation program that will teach 
you how to relax and reduce excess tension, self-regulate your 
stress responses and develop new ways of coping with stress. 
In learning these methods, you will be assisting in your own 
healing process rather than creating disharmony through 
ineffective ways of handling stress. The reason we recommend 
this program is because if you are experiencing fear, it usually
produces stress unless you already know how to handle it 
constructively. It is also important that this program include 
visualization guidance to enhance the healing process.

7.  If you don't know what is causing your fear or if the degree 
of fear you experience has reached the stage of panic, and you 
have avoided treatment due to this panic and you do not feel
like you can handle any of the above suggestions, then we highly 
recommend that you find a qualified therapist of your choice to 
assist you in changing your fear response. This stage of the fear 
cycle is called phobic or avoidance response. It is important that
you trust that this process is okay and that when you are ready, 
you will begin to work towards a solution. Again, here we 
encourage treating yourself with respect, acceptance and kindness.
