Letter From the Editor

Many women increase their calcium intake, unaware that the body
also requires magnesium.  The body keeps the two minerals in
balance, therefore increasing one without increasing the other
really does not have any real benefit as the body simply
disposes of the excess.  Optimally one should consume 1,000
milligrams of each per day.  However, your intake should
increase with age.  After menopause the recommended daily
allowance is 1,500 milligrams.  Remembering always to have that
balancing component. McMaster University researchers have
recently reported the importance of pregnant women increasing
their calcium intake to 1,500 to 2,000 mg per day. The results
of their study indicated that this could reduce the risk of
pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia; two of the
highest levels of concern in pregnancies,  by 70% and 60%
respectively.

"60-70 percent of American women are magnesium deficient." Says
Barbara from the Cornell Medical Center. "For women who take
calcium supplements and eat a calcium-rich  diet, it's probably
a good idea to take magnesium and eat magnesium-rich foods,
too."  Some caution should be taken to ensure that the calcium
magnesium levels don't get too high.  Elevated levels may lead
to diarrhea.  Whole grain breads, fortified cereals, leafy
vegetables, kale, broccoli, tofu, soybeans, low fat cheese, milk
and yogurt are good choices when trying to achieve a proper
balance.

In addition to maintaining healthy teeth and bones, calcium has
a number of other functions. Blood coagulation, transmission of
nerve impulses, muscle contraction and relaxation, normal heart
beat, stimulation of hormone secretion, and activation of enzyme
reactions all require certain amounts of calcium.  The bones in
the human body incorporate calcium into their structure and,
like all tissues in the body, are continually being reabsorbed
and reformed.

Section 1       Nutrition and Menopause
                  By June Kaminski, RN MSN
                http://www.visionsofadonai.com

Menopause is one of the most nutritionally challenging times in
a woman's life. Your informed food choices can have a positive
effect on your well-being as you move through this natural
change. To stay active, your body needs proper nourishment for a
smooth hormonal transition and sufficient energy reserves. A
well-rounded diet, with optimal levels of vitamins, minerals,
enzymes, and phytoestrogens will lay the groundwork for a
healthy adaptation to menopause. A balanced diet includes six
basic nutrients. These are water, carbohydrates, protein, fats,
vitamins, and minerals.

In mid-life, the need for all essential nutrients is important.
A healthy, balanced diet is the cornerstone of good health.
Nutrition and exercise are key factors in preventing heart
disease and osteoporosis. A plant-based diet, especially one
that includes soy products is abundant in phytoestrogens which
help to ease the symptoms of menopause and prevent cancer.

General Guidelines

The general guidelines for nutrition during menopause is to
choose a balanced diet using the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's recommendations of:

Minimum 1,500 calories per day

Fats, oils, sweets - use sparingly
Milk, yogurt, cheese - 2 to 3 servings per day
Meat, Fish, poultry, Dry beans, Eggs - 2 to 3 servings per day
Vegetables - 3 to 5 servings per day
Fruits - 2 to 4 servings per day
Bread, cereal, rice, pasta - 6 to 11 servings per day

Eat a low fat, high fiber diet with plenty of whole grains,
legumes, raw seeds and nuts, fruits, and vegetables.

Eat foods rich in phytoestrogens which are plant-derived
estrogen-like compounds:  Soybeans and soy products, apples,
carrots, yams, green beans, peas, pomegranates, potatoes, red
beans, brown rice, whole wheat, rye, and sesame seeds, legumes,
flaxseed, and pumpkin seeds.   Phytoestrogens are weaker
versions of human estrogen. There are over 300 plants with
estrogen-like activity, but soy bean products(such as tofu) are
the highest. In countries like Japan and China where soy beans
are used daily, there are much lower breast cancer rates and
symptoms of menopause are scant. Phytoestrogens can provide an
estrogen lift without increasing the risk of cancer as hormone
replacement therapy frequently does. Phytoestrogens also help
reduce the thinning of the vaginal tissues which is often
associated with menopause.

Vitamin and Mineral Supplements

Most vitamins and minerals are available by eating a varied,
well-rounded diet. There is usually no reason to take vitamin
and mineral supplements, but each woman should assess her
nutritional status and needs individually. If you show signs of
vitamin or mineral deficiency, your physician, alternative
therapist or nutritionist may suggest some form of vitamin and
mineral preparation.

Eat foods high in Calcium: milk, yogurt, cheese, oysters,
sardines, canned salmon with bones intact, dark green
vegetables, spinach, broccoli, and supplements as needed.  Eat
Folate rich foods for protection against heart disease: legumes,
orange juice, green vegetables.

Tips for Enjoyable Dining and Digestion

For better digestion and a healthier lifestyle, try these tips:

Take some time to plan your meals.
Take time to savor your meals.
Light some candles, play soft music, and enjoy.
Don't rush.
Eat when you are hungry.
Let your body tell you when it is time to eat, not the clock.
Eat four to six small meals throughout the day, instead of
two to three large meals.
Eat some calcium-rich food just before bedtime.
Ten to twenty minutes of direct, moderate sunlight on your
arms or back per day makes 400 I.U. of Vitamin D - for free!

You have reached a time in your life when your inner wisdom
is at its peak. Draw on your own inner knowing to recognize
your need for certain healthy foods, and ingest these accordingly.
Try to couple good eating habits with regular exercise, reflection
and lots of fresh air. Menopause can be a time of great self
knowledge and satisfaction. Eating well is the perfect start!

Section 2       Editor's Pick

"How to Heal Your Electrical Body" ebook is all about looking at
things differently - from an electrical perspective. Actually
all life in the universe - including the human body is made up
of electrons, protons, etc. and should be nourished
electrically.

This ebook explains this difficult concept in an easily
understandable way. The reader will become enlightened as to how
nutrients are absorbed by our electrical bodies. A very
important concept in view of the fact that unless our nutrition
is "electrical", it cannot be used by our bodies and may even be
slowly poisoning us. I highly recommend this new ebook by master
herbalist, Rita Lambros-Segur.

himself in the shed! That leave me  up to my elbows in ick,
sucking in fumes  in that tiny little space... I've gotten stuck
  in there before you know! What can i do?

Signed, The Lonely Oven Queen.

~~~~~

Dear Oven Queen,   Smile sweetly at your Darling Husband,  while
you pass the brochures of beautiful  Self Cleaning Ranges. Let
him know that  he'll be barbecuing much more often now  since
the oven is so icky to clean. Perhaps  with Santa coming soon,
he will get the message!

Section 4       Hypo-Thyroidism: The Hidden Epidemic
                         By Dr. John H. Maher
                      http://www.rxforwellness.com

While not generally considered one of the "Hormones Of Youth",
thyroid deficiency can increase your risk of age related
disorders. Sub-optimal thyroid means sub-optimal metabolism,
which translates into weight gain and its associated ills of
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and even cancer.

Some doctors estimate that as much as 15% to 40% of the
population of the US suffers from sub-optimal thyroid function!

Unfortunately, blood tests only pick up the more frank cases of
hypo-thyroidism. The standard blood test criteria is a low T4
and a high TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). Because of this
insensitivity, some doctors have dubbed sub-optimal thyroid as
the "much mis-diagnosed malady."  A check list of common
hypo-thyroid symptoms follows:

low body temp.__ dry skin/hair__ gain weight too easily__
brittle nails__ insomnia__ fatigue__ headaches/migraines__ poor
short term memory and concentration__ depression__ PMS__
menstral difficulties__ low motivation and ambition__ hair loss
(including outer third of the eyebrows)__ fluid retention__
dizzyness or lightheadedness__ irritabiltiy__ food
intolerances__ tendency towards substance abuse__ anxiety/panic
attacks__ drooping, swollen eyes__skin
problems/infections/acne__ infertility__ dry eyes__heat and cold
intolerance__ low blood pressure__ elevated cholesterol__
irritable bowel__ constipation__acid indigestion__ poor
co-ordination__ low libido__reduced or excessive sweating__
frequent colds or sore throats__ astmhma/allergies__ slow
healing __ itchiness__ slow speech__recurrent infections__ food
cravings__ muscle cramps__mood swings__ crying jags__stiff
joints__ loss of appetite__ pale skin__coarse or leathery skin__

Like growth hormone, thyroid hormone effects about every cell in
the body. It regulates the metabolism, which is the processes by
which we release energy for all our vital processes, including
body temperature and heart beat. This butterfly shaped gland
sits just below your Adam's apple. The major mineral for the
thyroid is iodine. Deficiency of iodine will lead to full blown
hypo-thyroidism with a goiter. A goiter in this case is a
hypertrophied thyroid trying in vain to create active thyroxin.
Fortunately, iodized salt has made this much less common.

The best way to screen for hypo-thyroid is to first note if you
suffer from several or more of the above symptoms. Then check
for a low body temperature using the following Dr. Broda Barnes
Axillary Temperature test.

1) Shake down an ORAL thermometer and place it next to your bed
BEFORE you go to sleep.
2) As soon as you wake up, place the thermometer under your armpit
and leave it there for 10 minutes BEFORE getting up.
3) Record the temperature. If it is below normal rising temperature,
which is 97.8 to 98.2 degrees F, for three consecutive days, you are
likely hypothyroid.
(Menstruating females should wait until after their first day of
their period before taking this tests.)

Temperatures of 96.6 or less almost guarantees hypo-thyroidism
even in the presence of normal blood tests. A pulse of 65 or
less in the NON-AEROBICALLY is also suggestive of
hypo-thyroidism when combined with an axillary temperature of
less than 97.8 and several of the aboxe hypo-thyroid symptoms.

If your self-tests suggest hypo-thyroidism, have you doctor do a
thyroid panel. If it is abnormal, than prescription whole
thyroid with "thyroxin" (not synthetics) are indicated.

If your blood tests are "normal" remember this is common with
sub-optimal thyroid conditions. We recommend an OTC thyroxin
free whole thyroid supplement to stimulate the thyroid to
produce more of its own thyroxin in such cases. These product
resources can be found at a good health food store.  Generally
take 1 or 2 a day, depending on your size and the extent of the
sub-optimal hypo-thyroid findings. In 6 weeks your temperature
should improve at least 50% toward normal, your heart beat up
50% toward normal, and half of your symptoms should be at least
50% better.

If that occurs continue indefinitely on 1 or 2 a day, which ever
works best. It takes about six weeks to notice a difference when
adding or subtracting thyroid supports.  Fast heart beat,
shakes, sweating, moist skin and palm of hands, weight loss,
increased appetite, intense drive and personality, and axillary
temperature above 98.2 are signs of over stimulating the
thyroid. All thyroid supplements then should be discontinued!

Remember taking progesterone and growth hormone enhancers
support the thyroid and estrogen is antagonistic.
