            Dental Stressors 
             by  Dr. Trager

As I have stated in my earlier articles, the key first 
step in preventing, reversing and healing dis-ease or 
dis-harmony is awareness. By this I mean conscious 
awareness of ourselves, our lives, and our surroundings.

Awareness of ourselves mirrors our attitudes, beliefs,
thoughts, images, feelings, behaviors and actions.

Ultimately , being in control of these parts of ourselves,
will result in optimum health and well being.

Being aware of our lives and surroundings involves looking
honestly at our work and family relationships and how they
relate to our individual well being.

I have stressed the importance of becoming aware of the
multiplicity or causes and contributing factors to
periodontal disease. We are now ready to look at these
causes in more depth and to discuss ways to address these
factors so you may be able to reverse and heal the disease
resulting from these causes.

I will begin with causes on the physical or physiological
level, since these will be the most familiar and the easiest
to recognize. Keep in mind our hierarchical philosophy,
where our attitudes and beliefs affect our thoughts and
images, which affect our feelings and emotions, which
affects our behaviors and actions, which in turn affects our
physical bodies. (These affects can be reciprocal.)

The causes and contributing factors to disease usually takes
the form of stressors to the immune system, which
eventually experiences overload and opens the door to
disease. for this reason we will us the work stressors when
referring to the causes of disease.

Dental Stressors.
a) Faulty or improperly fitting dental fillings, crowns, 
bridges or prosthetic appliances. Poor fitting or worn 
out dental work can cause a number of problems.

1) compromised ability to chew or function properly. Teeth
may not meet properly causing excessive pressures to the
intricate structures that support the teeth and attach them 
to the bone. this is the periodontal structures and the loss 
of integrity of this structure leads to periodontal disease. 
Some teeth may be overworking, some working little or not at 
all. the important thing is balance and harmony. You may have
heard the old axiom that “form follows function”. In the case
of the mouth it has great merit. By working diligently to
consciously balance your chewing by distributing foods
equally on both sides,  by chewing either bilaterally (both
sides at the same time), or alternatively (some chewing on
one side, then an equal amount on the other until the food
is almost a liquid consistency): can restore integrity,
flexibility, resilience and strength to the periodontal
structure, thus increasing resistance to disease and healing.

Symptoms of dysfunction may be found in dental pain and
discomfort you may be experiencing. For example
see-sawing to hot, cold (temperature changes), biting or
chewing pressure, sweets, sour or salty foods.

A thorough dental examination may be needed to assess
the extent of the poor dental work and a plan for
correcting the problem undertaken.

In our next article we will continue with other dental
stressors as well as going into the other stressors that
may affect us.

Section 2
    Massage Therapy As A Holistic Healing Tool for
       Breast Cancer and Heart Disease(Part 2:) 
               by Laurel Duran, CMT


As I stated in Part 1 of this series on breast and heart
conditions, when one makes manual contact with the
clavicle tender spots beneath both bones while simultaneously
laying a hand gently on the pubis, emotions held inside the
body are encouraged to come up and be felt. Because the
primary issue expressed by the breasts/heart chakra is
“healing emotional conflict through feeling”, it is very normal
and healthy that a massage therapy client would experience
their emotions during and after a massage that includes this
simple opening technique. To feel honest emotions is to move
energy in the body, and physical illness has roots in the client’s
emotional energy usage patterns. By literally feeling what was
previously repressed and blocked, the client is engaging in
healing him/herself naturally.


For most of us, such physical and emotional surrender does not
come instantly.


The reason I begin most massage therapy sessions with this
emotional opening technique is that most clients need a bit 
of time to experience resting in the safe womb of the massage
environment before their worldly defenses fall away. Massage
therapists often suggest the client “just let go” or “allow
ourselves to surrender” because the less physical and mental
resistance the client generates, the more the massage can help.
But underneath the therapist’s skilled manual techniques and
mental suggestions lies another very important breast/heart
issue: self-nurturance, or self-mothering.


When each of us was first forming in our mother’s womb, the
sound that became our lifeline was the beating of our mother’s
heart. After 9 months of growing in tune with that sound, we
emerged from the womb’s safety, crying out to be nurtured at
our mother’s breasts, where we could listen once again to that
original soothing sound of her beating heart.


But many of us were not breast fed, or were in many other
ways denied access to our essential need for the safe, tender
nurturance and complete nourishment from our mothers.
In fact, many of our mothers and our mothers’ mothers did not
receive all the nurturance they truly needed. On one hand we
could say that we’re all doing the best we can with what we
have, and we hope that every generation improves upon the past.
But on the other hand, psychologists tell us that when a
vulnerable infant cries out and consistently fails to receive a
loving response from a caring adult, the seeds of later emotional
conflict and inadequate nurturance modeling are planted. We now
know that many adult psychological problems relate to a lack of
healthy nurturance in our early years.


Breast cancer has been clearly linked to a woman’s feeling
undeserving of self-nurturance, and heart conditions have
been linked to constantly repressing normal, human emotional
responses. Breast cancer or heart patients may not consciously
realize this but by choosing to receive the complete nurturance
of compassionate massage therapy they are potentially changing
the entire course of their illness and embarking on a pathway 
to self-healing.


If the compassionate massage therapist makes him/herself
available for the client to safely allow emotional conflicts 
to rise up and out during the session... if the compassionate 
massage therapist sees him/herself providing the safe comfort 
of thoroughly nurturing touch ... and if the client trusts 
the massage therapist to be caring and compassionate while 
they unburden their breasts/heart ... then together they are 
healing the client’s past in the present, thereby making way 
for a healthy future!


In my 21 years as a massage therapist, I have assisted many
heart condition clients with unblocking their hearts by
feeling their emotions on the therapy table. I have also been
honored to be a part of many breast cancer clients’ feeling
their honest emotional turmoil as I respond to them with the
tender acceptance and nurturance they may not have received
in childhood. Over time I have been given miraculous feedback
from many of these clients indicating they have successfully
healed themselves. I am profoundly fulfilled every time a 
client trusts me enough to surrender their vulnerability 
during a massage because for me, there is no greater joy 
than the joy of healing!

        NATIVE AMERICAN WISDOM HEALS COMMON AILMENTS
                 By: Humaira Anne Sinnott

Astounding clinical results (97.8%) verify the ability of a
desert plant extract to treat numerous viral conditions.
Recently, the media spotlight has illuminated almost
unbelievable statistics about the prevalence of herpes virus
infections in modern society. Usually not life-threatening to
otherwise healthy adults, the herpes virus can result in
physical conditions ranging from cold sores, genital herpes,
shingles, and chronic fatigue syndrome to Kaposi's sarcoma.
Conversely, herpes virus infections can become quite serious,
sometimes life threatening, in immune compromised patients
such as those with AID's, recipients of bone marrow or
organ transplant, cancer victims, people of advanced age
or newborn babies.  One of the most devastating public health
concerns among industrialized nations is sexually
transmitted disease.  The prevalence of Genital herpes,
caused by HSV-2 is escalating worldwide.  It is estimated that
31 million Americans are infected with the virus and 1 in 5
people over the age of 12 has genital herpes. Up to 1 million
new HSV-2 infections may be transmitted annually in this
country.

The most surprising fact about herpes virus is that 90%
of the population harbors one or more herpes viruses and
may not even know of their "carrier" status. Viruses can
lay dormant in the body for years before exhibiting any
symptoms. In fact, the chickenpox virus (herpes zoster)
is this same virus, which can later in life cause shingles.
The viral culprits usually live in the nerve roots and are
triggered to "activate" during times of stress, immune
compromise, disease or aging. The chronic effects of
subacute infection by these viruses are being
convincingly linked with coronary artery disease,
lymphoma, multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative
conditions. As time goes on, technological and medical
advances may continue to implicate herpes virus in other
diseases as well (cancers, autoimmune and muscular
disorders).

The traditional regimen for herpes virus conditions involves
a course of pharmaceutical intervention. Unfortunately,
for a significant number of individuals these drugs do not
prove useful, especially in the case of shingles and
post-herpetic neuralgia.

In looking at alternative approaches to anti-viral treatments
researchers in Arizona began investigating larrea tridentata,
a desert plant that is abundant in North America.  Historical
information tells us that the shrub has been used as a
medical panacea for centuries by Native Americans.
Traditionally, larrea was used to treat infections,
chickenpox, burns, rheumatism, bronchitis, and digestive
disorders amongst a myriad of other condition.  Larrea
was truly the "medicine chest of the desert southwest".
Physician and consumer use reports have verified historical
use and Larreacorp's laboratory data and clinical findings,
which establish tremendous efficacy (97.8%) of the plant
compounds to combat a number of herpes conditions
(cold sores, genital herpes, shingles, Cytomegalovirus,
Kaposi's sarcoma, etc.).  A wide array of phytochemicals,
flavonoids and lignans show significant anti-oxidant
effects as well as anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-fungal,
and anti-inflammatory properties and are responsible for
the plant's medicinal activity.

Section 5.  Talk to Garlic
Dear Garlic,
I have an obnoxious 15 year old son who thinks he
knows everything, but can't seem to figure out when
the dishes need to be done or how to wash them. I
refuse to do them for him, but often there are so many
that I can't even see the counter. Every day it's a big
fight. What can I do?

Desperately Seeking Counter



Dear Counter Seeker


The teenage years can be the greatest challenge a parent 
ever meets. There is no such thing as a reasonable teenager. 
However, one thing at all times. SHOW NO WEAKNESS! KEEP
CALM!  REFUSE TO ARGUE! DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS!

If its his job to do dishes, then he does them or nobody
does.  I know, I know  “then you can’t cook” breakfast,
lunch or supper. DON’T. Just DON’T.  I wouldn’t get into
an argument with him. Just take yourself  and whoever else
is in the family out to dinner for a few days. DO NOT
take your teenager. DO NOT argue with him about his
responsibilities.  Put a sign on the kitchen door reading
 “disaster area, DANGER”.

Simply go and have dinner, and when you get home and
he asks what is for supper, tell him you find it impossible
to cook with the kitchen in the state its in. Then head for
the TV room or whatever. Also, if you normally make his
lunch, or do anything on a regular basis  that involves 
using the kitchen, STOP DOING IT!  STOP RIGHT NOW!

You’ve heard the term “tough love”. This will probably be
harder on you than on him, but HANG TOUGH! Just don’t
go in the kitchen. Sooner rather than later, the kitchen will
get cleaned. (and don’t worry, he won’t starve to death for
at least 2 weeks).
