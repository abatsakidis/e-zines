QUESTIONS NEEDING ANSWERS:

1) Is it true that maturity onset non-insulin dependent 
(Type II) diabetes mellitus is caused by mal adaptive 
reactions (immunologic and non-immunologic ) to foods, 
chemicals and inhalants?

2) How can Type II diabetes mellitus be prevented and 
also reversed?

3) If Type II diabetes mellitus is preventable and 
reversible, why have you not heard about this before?

You will find the answers to these questions fascinating!

                         INTRODUCTION

The Secret of Preventing and Reversing Diabetes is presented 
in a  3-part series. In part one you will get an over all view 
of the problem of diabetes, and the dynamics that play a role 
in it's development. Part two will help you find out the 
"secret" of preventing and reversing diabetes. In part three, 
you will find out how to manage the degenerative conditions 
associated with diabetes such as - obesity and hypertension, 
vascular diseases, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and infections.

             TYPES OF DIABETES MELLITUS

There are two main types of diabetes that are classically 
recognized; 
1) Type I, which is insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and, 
2) Type II, which is non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
There is a third type of diabetes mellitus that has in more 
recent years been recognized and that is secondary diabetes 
mellitus which is secondary to a number of factors.

Type I diabetes mellitus results from injury to the pancreas. 
The most likely usual cause is a mal adaptive food reaction 
of an IG immunologic type. This is to a food that is used 
frequently by the person affected. Cows milk immunologic 
allergy is frequently involved. Secondary to the food allergy,  
a pancreatic islet cell auto immune reaction develops. Other 
causes are viral pancreatitis from mumps or an enterovirus 
such as Coxsackie virus B4. 

Type I diabetes mellitus usually develops in childhood and 
is commonly called juvenile diabetes mellitus.

Dr. Philpott's experience with Type I diabetes mellitus has 
demonstrated that these patients also need to rotate their 
foods on a 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet. They still require 
insulin which is classically reduced by two-thirds when foods 
are rotated. 

The food rotation stops the insulin resistance to the foods 
to which they are mal adaptively reacting. Even though these 
mal adaptive reactions to foods did not initiate their illness, 
it is a secondary complication to their illness.

Type II is non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. This 
can develop at any age, but usually develops after age 40. 
Classically, there is adequate insulin until the late 
deteriorated stage. Eighty percent are obese at the time 
of diagnosis. 

It is accepted that environmental factors play a strong role 
in the development of Type II diabetes mellitus.  There is 
acceptance of 

1) strong evidence of environmental factors, and 
2) the fact of complication symptoms of classic diabetes 
mellitus developing before the classic criteria of diabetes 
mellitus is present. This is consistent with Dr. Philpott's 
evidence of diabetes mellitus Type II being a process 
extending over several years with a compensated stage of 
several years preceding the decompensated stage at which 
time specific diagnostic criteria of diabetes mellitus is 
in evidence which then results in the diagnosis of 
clinically significant diabetes mellitus Type II.

It is observed that both Type I and Type II involve mal 
adaptive reactions to foods and or chemicals with the 
difference being that Type I has an auto immune reaction 
or another reason such as a viral infection which destroys 
pancreatic islet cells.  Whereas, in Type II diabetes 
mellitus there is not an auto immune reaction. In Type II 
the central driving cause of the diabetes mellitus is 
insulin resistance which is secondary to the mal adaptive 
food reactions. In Type I, there is also insulin resistance 
developed by food reactions even though the initiating cause 
was not initially insulin resistance.  Dr. Philpott's studies 
have demonstrated that insulin resistance is present in both 
types of diabetes mellitus and therefore, both types should 
follow a 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet.

Secondary diabetes mellitus is present due to known factors 
such as several genetic disorders, systemic diseases and 
specific chemical agents. It is important to observe that 
diabetes mellitus can develop secondary to some frequently 
used medications such as diuretics and hypertensive agents 
(Thiazide diuretics, clonidine, furosemide) neuroactive 
agents (haloperidol, lithium carbonate, phenothiazine, 
tricyclic antidepressants, adrenergic agonists) and agents 
with hormonal activity such as oral contraceptives, 
progestins and glucorticoids. 

Dr. Philpott's research studies have demonstrated that 
the central cause of diabetes mellitus Type II is that of 
mal adaptive reactions to foods frequently eaten by the 
affected person. Sometimes, chemicals to which the person 
is chronically or frequently exposed is also a cause. Dr. 
Philpott's observations places Type II diabetes mellitus 
as a secondary type of diabetes mellitus.

Why have you not heard of this before, and why has this 
fact not been recognized and implemented in treating 
diabetes mellitus Type II?  

The fact is, the discovery of diabetes mellitus being 
secondary type diabetes to reactions to foods and 
sometimes chemicals resulted out of Dr. Philpott's study 
of my mental patients, some of which were diabetics. He 
used a broad spectrum monitoring of many factors which 
included an initial five days of avoidance. Food and 
chemicals were withdrawn, and only water was allowed.
Individual foods were then monitored, with the blood 
sugar. Frequently the insulin taken before each meal, 
one hour and sometimes two hours after the test meal 
of a single food was also monitored. 

This demonstrated two factors. That there was a 
compensated stage that preceded the decompensated 
diabetes mellitus stage. This also demonstrated that 
the single cause of insulin resistance is that of the 
mal adaptive reaction to foods in which the body cells 
are swollen and therefore their insulin receptors could 
not function properly because of the edema of the body 
cells. The fact that when the mal adaptive foods were 
left out of the diet, there was no insulin resistance 
and the blood sugar was normal is evidence that the 
central cause of insulin resistance is the cells that 
are swollen due to the mal adaptive reactions. In the 
compensated stage of the diabetes mellitus process these 
cells are swollen for a brief period such as two, three 
or four hours whereas in the decompensated stage the 
cells were swollen for a longer period of time and thus, 
the hyperglycemia is extended for a longer period of time.

                               SYNDROME  X

Syndrome X consists of hyperinsulinism, hypertension, 
carbohydrate intolerance, obesity, disordered fat metabolism 
and accelerated atherosclerosis.  The co-association of 
hyperinsulinism and glucose intolerance is secondary to 
mal adaptive reactions to foods or chemicals. Hyperinsulinism 
is known to cause the liver to turn carbohydrates into fats, 
thus this person has difficulty losing weight under the usual 
circumstances of a diet consisting of reduced calories since 
the hyperinsulinism produces a situation of turning the 
carbohydrates into fats. Solving the problem of mal adaptive 
reactions to foods causing the hyperinsulinism is necessary 
before this person can lose weight, thus the importance of a 
4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet is a must for these people. 

Hyperinsulinism is known to produce hypertension. Thus, the 
hypertension is secondary to the hyperinsulinism. Again, the 
answer has to be to stop the mal adaptive food reactions by a 
4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet which initially leaves out the 
foods that are used with a frequency of twice a week or more. 
Characteristically, these can be returned to the diet after 
three months of avoidance. Also the other factors such as 
cholesterol and triglyceride disorders and the development 
of atherosclerosis are reversed when using a 4 Day Diversified 
Rotation Diet. 

It is a catastrophe that the persons with this syndrome are 
often treated with hypertensive medication due to the 
hypertension, yet these medicines for hypertension are known 
to accelerate the development of diabetes mellitus. It is 
important not to place these hypertensive patients on 
hypertensive medications. 

In  Dr. Philpott's examination of patients with this syndrome, 
he has demonstrated that it is mal adaptive reactions to foods 
and sometimes chemicals that produce this syndrome and that by 
following a period of avoidance of their commonly used foods 
and frequently contacted chemicals results in a correction of 
their hypertension, hyperinsulinism, carbohydrate intolerance 
and other developing symptoms that are classic of diabetes 
mellitus disease process complications.

                           ***

Next month, in segment two of this series, you will find out 
the "secret of preventing and reversing diabetes."

Section 4         Nutrition for Prostate Health
                   
                     by Andrea Lemieux, RNCP

----------

It wasnit long ago when many men didnit even know they 
had a prostate, let alone consider that they, as well 
as women, experience ihormonal changes.i Considering 
that many men develop benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 
as they age, largely as a result of hormonal changes, 
it is time to look at how men can benefit from a diet 
and lifestyle that supports hormonal health.

Certainly, exposure to environmental chemicals from tap 
water, cigarettes, car fumes, smog, pesticides, and food 
preservatives has a detrimental effect on hormonal health. 
Couple this with sugar, refined flour and excess saturated 
fat in the diet and we can begin to understand todayis rise 
in prostate disease in men.

A good first step for prostate health would be to focus 
on fresh, whole, unrefined, and unprocessed food, and not 
to smoke. There is a higher concentration of zinc in the 
prostate than any other organ in the body. This mineral 
is required for the metabolism of all hormones within the 
prostate. Zinc is lost in food processing and cigarette 
smoke is a major source of cadmium, a known antagonist 
of zinc.  

Here are some guidelines that will put you in control of 
the health of your prostate gland, not to mention your 
overall well-being.

Build your diet around whole, unprocessed foods: whole 
grains; legumes; raw nuts and seeds; a reasonable amount 
of protein from fish, poultry, eggs, and lean meat; and 
plenty of fruits and vegetables -- especially the richly 
coloured green, orange, red and yellow varieties.

Avoid additives, colourings,  preservatives, and tobacco; 
they are toxic substances that will alter your hormonal 
balance.   

Avoid caffeine, soft drinks, decaffeinated coffee, and 
refined sugar; they all affect prostate function.

Avoid or limit alcohol; beer and wine in particular are 
associated with BPH, possibly because they contain 
mycotoxins (mold), which are thought to promote cancer.

Avoid using hydrogenated oils like margarine or partially 
hydrogenated and processed oils; they are carcinogenic 
and pose other serious health hazards. 

Limit saturated fats (mainly from red meat and dairy 
products) and increase essential fats from raw nuts and 
seeds, flax and olive oils, and cold-water fish. Essential 
fatty acid deficiency is found in those with BPH.

Eat foods high in zinc: raw pumpkin seeds, poultry 
(particularly dark meat), fish, seafood (oysters are 
notably high), eggs, legumes, and whole grains. If you 
have prostatitis, 30 mg./day of zinc citrate as a supplement 
could be helpful. Remember that it is best to consult with 
a health care professional before taking supplements for a 
medical condition.

Drink 6 - 8 glasses of pure water every day. Dehydration 
puts stress on the prostate.

Add soy foods, like tofu to the diet. The phytoestrogens 
and isoflavonoids in soybeans may reduce the risks of prostate 
cancer. Although soy is highly beneficial, have it in small 
portions; large quantities can block the uptake of essential 
minerals, including zinc.

Exercise is essential to prostate health. It will release 
tension and increase blood circulation to the tiny muscles 
and blood vessels in the prostate area.
It is important that men express their feelings and deal 
with stress. Having a creative outlet and learning techniques 
to relieve stress, such as deep breathing, stretching, and 
various forms of meditation, are valuable tools to achieving 
emotional equilibrium.

One of a few natural remedies with proven benefits for the 
prostate gland is the herb Saw Palmetto (Serenoa repens). 
For men with BPH it will promote shrinkage of the gland and 
improve urinary function. The best form to use is a 
standardized extract, 160 mg. twice a day. As a preventive 
it could be taken for one to two weeks each month.

			Nutritional Profile of Tofu

Combined with whole grains, this soyfood makes a high-quality 
protein. Tofu is cholesterol free and low in saturated fats. 
It is an excellent source of calcium and a good source of 
other minerals such as iron, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, 
and sodium. It also contains essential B vitamins, choline, 
and vitamin E.

Soy also contains important isoflavones, including genistein 
and daidzein. Consumption of isoflavones may help prevent 
hormone-related cancers. They have been shown to block the 
negative effects of estrogens in women and androgens in men, 
protecting against breast and prostate cancers. These 
phytochemicals may also protect against other forms of cancer, 
heart disease and osteoporosis. Due to its anti-inflammatory 
properties, it may have applications for conditions such as 
arthritis, bursitis and rheumatic diseases. 

Four ounces of Tofu contains: 
8-13 grams of protein, 
0 cholesterol, 
130 calories, 
7.9 mg. sodium 
7.9 grams unsaturated fat 
1.2 grams saturated fat 
120-300 mg. calcium 
2.9 mg. Iron 
approximately 31 mg. isoflavones

                Summer Chickpea Salad with Basil

-----

Chickpeas, or garbanzo beans, are one of the most nutritious 
of the legumes. They are high in iron, calcium, potassium, 
vitamin A, and unsaturated fats. Combined with a whole grain, 
they are rich in protein. Of all the legumes, the chickpea, 
which in appearance looks like a heart, is said to be the most 
beneficial for the heart. The cooking method given here can be 
used for most legumes to enhance their digestibility.

1 cup dried chickpeas or 3 cups drained canned chickpeas
1 red bell pepper
1 cup diced cucumber
1/4 cup minced red onion
1/4 cup packed chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup packed chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice, apple cider vinegar or 
        brown rice vinegar 
1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
Sea salt and pepper to taste

1. For dried chickpeas, soak them for 8 - 10 hours. Drain and 
   Rinse. Put in heavy pot with water to cover by 1i, bring to 
   a boil, foam will form on top. Drain and rinse and return 
   to pot with fresh water to cover by 2i. Bring to a boil, 
   if more foam forms on top, skim it off. Reduce heat to 
   simmer and cook with cover slightly ajar for 2 - 3 hours, 
   until chickpeas are tender. (Time depends on age of chickpeas). 
   If necessary, add more water as needed. Drain and rinse and 
   set aside.

2. Put the red pepper about 2i below the broiler in oven, as 
   skin starts to blacken turn it to blacken all sides. Place 
   in a paper bag and close and let sit 5 - 10 minutes. When 
   steamed long enough and cool enough to handle, peel off the
   skin. Seed the pepper and chop coarsely.

3. In a bowl combine the red pepper, chick-peas, cucumber, onion, 
   parsley and basil.

4. In a small dish, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, 
   garlic and salt and pepper to taste; pour over the salad and 
   toss lightly. Cover and refrigerate before serving. This 
   salad tastes best if flavours are allowed to develop and
   blend for a few hours (or even a day). 

Serves 8.
