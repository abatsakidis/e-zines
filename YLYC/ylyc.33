                         Letter from the Editor

         We've got a terrific article this week for all of 
the gardeners in the family. This weeks herb has a 
multitude of benefits and has been found to be highly
effective for the treatment of enlarged prostate and 
prostate cancer. We also receive a number of requests 
through our Find a Practitioner program for Holistic 
Dentists. Check out this weeks article written by a 
Holistic Dentist on Mouth First Aid. 

    I know I mentioned this in our last issue, but in case 
you missed it or didn't have a chance to get there... I'm 
going to mention it again.
 
      "eDiets" is an online diet program. Each members diet is 
individualized  based on a profile you fill out. What impressed
me is that it takes into consideration any health issues, special diets
(like Diabetes or cholesterol for example), and any medication
 you may be taking. Even most off-line programs don't do this.
It also offers you a choice of meal plans  for busy lifestyles or 
for those who like to spend more time  cooking. Members also 
receive online support. It seems to be very thorough and I can't
believe how reasonably priced!
 Here's what some people are saying:

 "I feel better. I have never been so healthy in my life...This
 is my 4th week and still going....C'mon....its actually kind of
 fun."

 "My program really is customized for me! I was skeptical at
 first, but it's simple to follow, the online meetings are neat,
 and it's working. I'm a believer"
 -Karen
 P.S. I love my personal shopping list"

 By the way, you get a new shopping list each week and you can
 reuse them long after you finish the program. It's well worth
 the visit! Check out eDiets for yourself!
 (Important Note: expand your email to maximum. If the link below

 Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

 Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

     My son suffers from asthma and allergies. We've had him 
on several types of medication, but he doesn't respond to any 
of them. I started giving him Mullein and Pan Pan Lien because 
I had read and was told that these two herbs are very helpful 
for the respiratory system. These two herbs did a wonderful 
job at clearing out excessive mucus in his lungs. The Doctor 
was also relieved because none of the medication he prescribed 
came close to being as effective.

 Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

     Last month my husband and I helped some friends tear 
down a cottage by the lake. My husband was using a ten 
pound sledge hammer doing hard physical labor. I was 
doing a lot of lifting and carrying. That night we could feel 
our muscles starting to tingle. We knew that we were going 
to be VERY sore the next day. We took a couple of capsules 
of White Oak and within an hour the tingling went away and 
we were fine the next morning. We use herbs for many things. 
This is a great one to keep around for general pain.

Nettles can be found growing in waste places and are very
abundant. They grow to a height of 15 to 24 inches with
stiff hairs on the stalks and the leaves are toothed and heart
shaped and about 2 to 4 inches long. The flowers are in
clusters at the leaf axils and are a greenish colour. They
are unisexual with either male or female on a given plant,
or on the same plant with males in upper leaf axils and
females flowers on the lower leaf axils. They are about
1/12" long.  The flowers appear from June to September.
They should be harvested when the flowers are in bloom for
medicinal use.

Caution must be used when harvesting these plants as the
small stiff hairs can cause a severe burning skin irritation.
When they are young they can be cooked and served as
greens or used in soups and stews. The family and genus
names come from the Latin URO, which means "I burn".
If you do get a rash from harvesting them try rubbing the
freshly bruised leaves of yellow dock or plantain over the
affected area. They often grow nearby the Nettles.

Traditionally in Europe, the leaf tea is used as a blood
purifier or blood builder, what we now call an alternative.
Nettles are also used as diuretics, astringents, for anemia,
gout, glandular diseases, asthma, urinary stones, nephritis
and cystitis,  rheumatism, poor circulation, enlarged spleen,
mucous discharges of the lungs, internal bleeding, diarrhea
and dysentery.

For bleeding such as endometriosis, or uterine bleeding,
combine equal parts of nettle leaf with agrimony, bayberry
and cinnamon barks. Steep in boiling water for twenty
minutes and take a cupful every hour, tapering off as bleeding
subsides.

A clinical study of nettle roots has found them to be highly
effective for the treatment of enlarged prostate. The roots
contain high amounts of sterols, especially sitosterol and
isolectins, which stimulate the production of white blood
cells that counteract infections and inflammations.

Studies suggest that Nettles are a good Central Nervous
System depressant, are anti-bacterial, and inhibit the
effects of adrenaline. The Germans have been using the
root in treatments for prostate cancer and the Russians are
using the leaves in alcohol for cholecystitis (inflammation of
the gall bladder), and hepatitis.

For the treatment of eczema Nettles will combine well with
Figwort and Burdock.

Preparation and Dosage;

Infusion;   pour a cup of boiling water onto 1 - 3 teaspoonfuls
of the dried herb and leave to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. This
can be drunk three times a day.

Tincture;   1 to 4 millilitres three times a day.

 Section 6         AROMA ARMY TO THE RESCUE

 ----------

    Most of us have a strong need to protect what is "near
and dear" - especially those places which provide us with
sanctuary and nourishment.  In today's busy and often
stressful world, we seek quiet places where nature abounds
in order to feel connected again to Mother Earth.  No wonder
that the garden has become the focal point for urban dwellers
to find respite from concrete, noise and dust.  Country gardens
also provide both a charming and practical environment where
birds and butterflies add their colour to those of wildflowers
and food crops. Even the "container garden" on the apartment
balcony can provide that so important connection to nature in
the inner city.

    Whenever we consider aromas in the garden we immediately
think of the beautiful perfumes emitted from our favourite flowers
and plants.  However, aromas have another valuable and lesser-
known role to play - they can actually protect the garden from
destruction and disease.  In the plant world, aroma is a matter
of life and death.  Some reproduction depends on the transfer
of pollen by bees, butterflies and moths.  The most highly-scented
flowers tend to be fertilized by butterflies & moths.  Fruity aromas
attract beetles which aid in fertilization and even unpleasant fishy
odours bring the needed dung and flesh flies to do the job.

    Aromas also protect certain plants from predators by making
them smell repugnant or rendering them poisonous to insects.

    Willow and alder trees when under attack by tent caterpillars
will produce strong terpenes and tannins in their leaves making
them undigestable to the enemy.  Not only do the trees fight back
but it is thought that they communicate by aroma to others of their
species who are at risk.  The threatened trees receive the aromatic
message and make the bio-chemical changes in their leaves before
the caterpillars arrive.  How sophisticated nature is!

    Now for some practical garden tips.  Roses intercropped with
garlic and onions not only are protected from predators and fungi
but their fragrances are enhanced as well.  Carrots planted beside
marigolds benefit from the protective aroma of the flowers.

    Essential oils act as natural pest deterrents and slow the growth
of bacteria, viruses, fungi and mould on plants.  A good way to
protect the garden is to plant protective varieties among vulnerable
ones.  Another method is to add the essential oils to the watering can
or use as a spray.  Basil can be planted alongside tomatoes or basil
oil in water can be used to protect the plants.  Tomatoes, treated
with basil oil even have an enhanced flavour.

    Roses love garlic, basil and thyme.  Thyme and lavender protect
all vegetable plants.  Four to eight drops of essential oil in four litres
of water make an excellent spray for flowers, fruits and veggies.
You can even place strings between the garden rows and spray the
strings with the essential oil/water mixture.

    Ants are deterred by peppermint oil and you can clear a nest
quickly by placing two neat drops of this oil directly on the nest.
Mice hate peppermint as well.

    To deter slugs, snails, mice, cats, dogs and ground-moving insects
from attacking your plants, bury a plastic tub with the top level to the
ground.  Add four drops of essential oil such as peppermint, spearmint,
thyme or eucalyptus.  Renew when needed.  Cats however love
citronella and dogs are attracted to lavender.

    If you want a very detailed list of essential oils to deter specific pest,
consult your aromatherapy book.

    Well there you are-an aromatic army is available to protect your
garden sanctuary.  No need to use those pesticides and chemicals.
Let nature by your ally.

Happy Gardening!

 Section 7          MOUTH FIRST AID

                          by Jacob Trager, DDS
        <A HREF="http://www.dentalwellness.net/">
            http://www.dentalwellness.net/</B></A>
                            888-758-8058

Jacob Trager, DDS, a 1962 honor graduate of the University
of Maryland School of Dentistry, was a leader in preventive
dentistry during the late 1960s.
Recognizing the relationship of the mouth with the total person,
Dr. Trager trained in the whole person psychological concept
called Psychosynthesis, to facilitate the integration of the mind
and body. He is also a licensed massage therapist (LMT)
specializing in craniosacral therapy (a gentle manipulative
technique that assists the body in maintaining and regaining
balance).
 -----

WARM SALT WATER SOAKS

Indicated for swelling, soreness and pain in the mouth Salt,
in too heavy a concentration can act as an Irritant.

Take 1/2 tsp. of sea salt (can be found at most health food
stores) and dissolve in an 8 oz. glass of warm water (your
finger must be able to stand the temperature or it will be
too hot for the mouth).

Take a mouthful and hold it on the affected side until the
warmth goes out of the mouthful. Repeat until the glass is
empty.

Repeat this every hour if the symptoms are acute or four
times a day until the symptoms have alleviated.



CUTS AND SCRAPES INSIDE THE MOUTH AND
        ON THE LIPS

Vitamin E covered with orabase, available at your pharmacy,
works effectively. If vitamin E liquid is not available, take a
200 unit vitamin E capsule and make a small opening In one
end and squeeze the necessary amount on the abrasion.

We recommend that you stay away from foods high in acid,
salt and pepper, and foods that are crispy.



CANKER SORES OR MOUTH ULCERS

Canker sores or mouth ulcers are often painful and Interfere
with normal eating. Avoid using harsh chemicals like
camphophenique as the phenol does not limit itself to the
surface tissue and can affect deeper tissue cells.

Use a gentle oral bandage like plain orabase to keep the ulcer
covered. This should allow gentle healing in several days. If the
sore or ulcer has not disappeared in ten to fourteen days, a
visit to your dentist Is recommended.



COLD SORES OR BLISTERS ON THE LIPS OR
        CORNERS OF THE MOUTH

At the first sign of a cold sore, usually a slight swelling, redness,
or soreness, begin taking a 500 mg. Lysine tablet or capsule
two to three times a day (available at your pharmacy or health
food store). This natural amino acid works wonders in the
prevention and treatment of this problem.
