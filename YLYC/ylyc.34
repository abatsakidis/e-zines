----------
The Secret of Preventing and Reversing Diabetes is
presented in a  3-part series. In part one you got an
overview of the problem of diabetes, and the dynamics
that play a role in it's development. Last month in Part
two,  you found out the "secret" of preventing and
reversing diabetes. Today in part three, you will find out
how to manage the degenarative conditions associated
with diabetes such as - obesity and hypertension, vascular
diseases, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and infections.


            OBESITY AND HYPERTENSION

Obesity and hypertension are considered together because of
their frequent association and common cause.  The common
denominator between obesity and hypertension is hyperinsulinism.

Hyperinsulinism disorganizes kidney function, and this causes
hypertension. The answer here is to stop the hyperinsulinism
by going on a 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet.

A special treatment for hypertension is to first of all follow the
basic treatment program and add to this the magnetic treatment
of the kidneys. This will not only immediately help the kidneys
work better, but also has the effect of healing the kidneys from
the damage that has been done by the prolonged exposure to
hyperinsulinism.

Hyperinsulinism stimulates the liver to turn carbohydrates into
fats, leading to obesity. This explains why calorie restricted diets
sometimes don't work. The answer is to first of all stop the
hyperinsulinism by going on a 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet
and then associate this with a calorie reduction diet.

Add to this the benefit of magnetic therapy. Magnets stimulate
the production of growth hormones. Growth hormone has as one
of its functions, the capacity to drop the fat from the fat cells.
Magnets can also be placed directly over the fatty areas. The time
for magnetic treatment is critical.  Growth hormone is only high
at night during sleep and therefore, the only appropriate time for
magnetic treatment of the fatty areas is during sleep.

                        VASCULAR DISEASES

Macrovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, cerebral
artery disease or peripheral vascular disease require a negative
magnetic field treatment over an extended period of time. A
lifestyle of nightly treatment (all night) is preferred. It will take
several months to reduce atheromatous plaques and thus reduce
symptoms.

This magnetic heart treatment is suitable for any and all cardiac
complications such as skipped or irregular beats, angina, cardiac
failure, post-coronary occlusion or any demonstrated abnormality
of the heart. Mitral valve prolapse is a condition resulting from a
swollen mitral valve. This is classically due to maladaptive food
reactions. This is treated by the 4-Day Rotation Diet and the
application of the negative pole of a negative magnetic field
directly over the heart.

The classic reasons given for the development of atherosclerotic
plaques are: 1) elevated insulin, 2) elevated blood sugar,
3) hypetriglyceridemia, and 4) glycation (caramelization).

Atheromatous plaques are formed by the precipitation of
amino acids and minerals (mostly calcium). Amino acids
are soluble in an alkaline medium and form insoluble gels
in an acid medium. Calcium is soluble in an alkaline medium
and form insoluble crystal precipitates in an acid medium.
Atheromatous plaques are a combination of these amino
acid and mineral insoluble deposits.

The acid state is produced by maladaptive reactions to foods
and chemicals. The answer to these atheromatous producing
states is to rotate the foods and avoid the chemicals that are
evoking maladaptive reactions. Then treat the affected area
with a negative magnetic field. A negative magnetic field
normalizes the pH to its normal alkaline state. Over a period
of time, this alkalinization, resolves the atheromatous
plaques by causing the amino acids and the minerals to go
back into solution.

Microvascular disease consists of capillary basement
membrane thickening and accumulation of insoluble
precipitates within the microvascular nets. This microvascular
disease condition can develop in any organ including the skin.
The answer to microvascular disease is to stop the
maladaptive reaction to foods by a 4 Day Diversified Rotation
Diet. The treatment for these microvascular diseased areas is
to place a negative magnetic field directly over them.

                     DIABETIC RETINOPATHY
                ( Diabetic eye degeneration)

An assortment of degenerative eye conditions develop as a
complication of the diabetes mellitus disease process both
in the compensated and decompensated stages. These
degenerations include the retina (diabetic retinopathy),
cataracts, macular degeneration and glaucoma. Beyond the
basic treatment, the eyes need to be specifically treated with
magnetic therapy. Special precautions need to be taken if
glaucoma is present.

                    DIABETIC NEUROPATHY

Nerve deterioration may occur in any part of the body as a
complication of the diabetes mellitus disease process. The
arms, shoulders, neck, legs or feet may be involved. Pain is
the most common symptom in neuropathy. The most
common area for pain is in the feet. This is sometimes
described as a burning pain in the soles of the feet. The
placement of a negative magnetic field over the painful area
is the most successful treatment, being superior to the usual
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and even superior
to narcotics. Magnetic therapy will often relieve the pain
where none of these usual pain relieving agents is successful.

                        AMYOTROPHY

Amyotrophy consists of injured neurones which eventually
die. Muscles enervated by these dying neurones waste and
become nonfunctional. This is a painless muscle wasting
condition. Most often, this occurs first in the lower
extremities. When this condition occurs in the compensated
diabetes mellitus stage, before the diagnostic criteria of
clinically significant diabetes mellitus is present, it is given
the diagnostic name of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
When a person  has been diagnosed as having clinically
significant diabetes mellitus it is diagnosed as a complication
of diabetes mellitus with the name of diabetic amyotrophy.
The answer is, first of all to rotate your foods on a 4 Day
Diversified basis. It is also wise to take manganese and
arginine supplements. Although, reliance on supplementing
arginine and manganese without rotating the foods is not
going to achieve the optimum function of the urea cycle.

Diabetics in the decompensated stage characteristically have
hyperammonemia. A lesser number in the compensated stage
also have hyperammonemia.

Autopsy examinations of amyotrophy lateral sclerosis cases
has demonstrated the consistent presence of ammonia at the
site of the deteriorated neurones. Therefore, it is concluded
that the known neuro-toxic qualities of ammonia is the cause
of amyotrophy whether this is in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis or in classically diagnosed diabetic amyotrophy.

Obviously, the therapeutic goal is to first of all, stop this
hyperammonemia so as to stop the killing of neurones. The
second goal is to reverse the state of the neurones that have
been injured but are not yet dead. By reversing the injured
state of neurones that are not yet dead there can be some
degree of recovery and there also can be the prevention of
the progression of the disease process. Therefore, it pays
to treat the spine with a negative magnetic field.

                         INFECTIONS

The skin of diabetics is not healthy and quite commonly,
especially in the feet, ulcers will develop. These have a mixed
type of bacterial and fungal infections. This can be
sufficiently disordering as to produce gangrene. Beyond the
basic treatment as described above, the local area should be
treated with a negative magnetic field. This treatment works
surprisingly well.

The negative magnetic field has an antibiotic effect against
any type of bacterial, any type of fungus and any type of virus.
Negative magnetic field therapy requires two weeks
minimum of 24-hour a day exposure to handle a local
infection.

Section 4     NUTRITION FOR HEALTHY BONES

                             by Andrea Lemieux, RNCP

        Read about Andrea Lemieux on our Meet the Team page;
                http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html

----------

Healthy bones depend on homeostasis, or balanced body
chemistry. Both men and women suffer bone loss as they
age, and bone loss often occurs long before menopause or
any decrease in estrogen levels. Although hormones affect
bone health, we need to look at them as part of the total
picture. When the body is in balance, then our pH
(acid/alkaline measure) is correct, mineral levels are
balanced, our endocrine glands secrete the right amount
of hormones, and we produce the enzymes we need to
support the digestive process. In short, every aspect of
our internal chemistry functions in harmony.

What upsets homeostasis? The chief culprit is the consumption
of refined foods. They tend to make our blood too acidic.
When this happens, calcium is drawn from the bones in order
to bring the blood back to its slightly alkaline state.

The following should be limited or avoided as they all rob
the bones of calcium and upset body chemistry:

. Carbonated beverages are high in phosphorus, which
    disrupts the calcium/phosphorus balance. Soft drinks
    are among the worst foods imaginable for someone
    trying to prevent osteoporosis.
. Red meat because it is also high in phosphorus.
. Processed meat and cheese and baked goods are high
   in phosphorus additives.
. Excess dairy products disrupt the balance of magnesium
   and calcium.
. Refined sugar, refined flour, processed food and junk food.
. Caffeine (tea, coffee, chocolate, soft drinks) stimulates a
   release of calcium from the bones.
. Alcohol suppresses bone growth and is harmful to the
    ovaries and liver.
. Excess salt.
. Excess saturated fat (animal fat) and trans fats, found in
    margarine and processed vegetable oils.
. Tobacco. Smoking decreases natural estrogen levels,
    acidifies the blood and prevents vitamin D activation,
    which robs the bones of minerals.

Getting enough calcium in your diet is important for bone
health, but just as essential is the total composition of your
diet. Bones need magnesium, boron, copper, zinc, vitamins
A, C, D, K, the B-complex, plus essential fatty acids...just
to mention a few!! Therefore, you want to consume a nutrient-
dense diet that includes moderate amounts of animal protein,
plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes,
nuts and seeds. Also drink at least 8 cups of pure water daily,
bones are made up of 25% water! Avoid tap water as excess
fluoride has been linked to hip fractures.

The following calcium-rich foods also contain other valuable
vitamins and minerals, and most contain necessary fiber as well:

. Sea vegetables are nature's highest source of easily absorbed
    calcium; ounce for ounce, they contain almost 10 times as
    much calcium as milk.
. Green leafy vegetables, especially kale, parsley, collards,
    dandelion leaves, and broccoli.
. Sardines and Salmon with bones (buy water-packed canned fish).
. Blackstrap molasses (unsulphured).
. Low-fat dairy products if tolerated.
. Legumes: chickpeas, lentils, beans - black, pinto, white,
    kidney, etc.
. Fresh, raw almonds, brazil nuts, and hazelnuts.
. Fresh, raw sesame seeds and sunflower seeds.
. Dried fruit (unsulphured).
. Grains: quinoa, amaranth.

Exercise is indispensable for bone health. Adding more
calcium to the diet won't necessarily result in more calcium
being deposited into the bones; a demand by the bones for
more calcium must be created through regular weight-bearing
exercise. Exercises such as walking, aerobics, and weight
lifting can not only significantly slow down the loss of bone,
but also add bone density, even in menopause. Duration of
exercise is more important than intensity, and it must be
done consistently. Outdoor exercise will add sunlight and
thus aid the body's vitamin D production, and so improve
calcium utilization. Be careful not to exercise to exhaustion;
over-exercising can cause distress which can lead to bone loss.

Calcium and magnesium supplementation has been found to
be valuable in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.
If you choose to take supplements, it is best to take one that
has half as much magnesium as calcium, plus vitamin D3. The
most bioavailable forms of calcium are citrate or hydroxyapatite,
even for people with deficient stomach acid, which is required
for calcium to be absorbed. The amount you take depends on
your individual situation: age, diet, level of activity, etc. Vitamin
C is also helpful because it helps create the collagenous fibers
to which the calcium of the bone is attached.

MISO SOUP

                           by Andrea Lemieux, RNCP


      Read about Andrea Lemieux on our Meet the Team page;
              http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html


----------

This Miso Soup is made with the calcium-rich sea vegetable,
Wakame. Because of its light taste, wakame is a good choice
for new-comers. Besides calcium, wakame is high in iron and
B vitamins. It also contains many trace minerals and vitamins
A and C.

Serves 4 - 6
6 cups water or homemade, salt-free vegetable broth
2 oz. dried wakame
1-2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 carrots, thinly sliced
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 teaspoon vegetable broth powder
1/2 teaspoon Celtic sea salt (gray salt)
4 tablespoons Hatcho miso (dark, soy miso)
Garnish: thinly sliced green onions

. Soak wakame in water to cover for 3 minutes, remove
    from water and carefully cut firm midriff section from the
    delicate green leaf. The midriff can be reserved for soup
    stock. Slice leaf into small pieces.
. Saute onion, carrots and celery in olive oil. When onion is
    translucent, add the water, wakame, vegetable broth powder
    and salt. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer
    25 - 30 minutes.
. Remove the soup from heat, take 1 cup of broth from the soup,
    and stir miso into it. When miso has dissolved, mix it with the rest
    of the soup. Cover and allow to sit (away from heat) for 5 - 10
    minutes and serve garnished with green onions. Do not cook the
    miso; this destroys valuable enzymes.

Leftover soup can be reheated slightly, but never let it boil.
