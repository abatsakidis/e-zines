Section 2    Prostate Problems Virtually A Fact Of Life

                 	By Brigitte Synesael 
         	    http://www.Life-Choices.com

        Read about Brigitte Synesael on our Meet the Team

----------      

	The general consensus is that it's not a question of whether 
or not a man will develop prostate problems, it's a question of WHEN.  
Although 80% of all cases of Prostate Cancer occur in men over the 
age of 65, it has been know to strike men as young as 30.

	Prostatitis, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia or 
BPH, is an inflammation of the prostate gland, which is located under 
the bladder and in front of the rectum.  A common cause is a bacterial 
infection spread from the urethra or other part of the body carried 
through the blood.  There are several other contributing factors; 
intermittent sexual contact, venereal disease, the use of a urinary 
catheter, a zinc deficiency, prolonged use of antihistamines and 
decongestants, exposure to pesticides and heavy metals, stress, and 
even high cholesterol levels are believed to promote prostate 
enlargement.  

	Symptoms include a burning pain when urinating and an increased 
frequency of urination. There could be some penile discharge or blood 
in the urine. Pain in the lower back, around the scrotum and rectum 
often accompanies prostatitis.  

	As frightening as this disease can be, there are a number of 
natural things that can be done to produce positive results. Maintaining 
a high fiber, low fat diet is helpful as fiber supports the digestive 
system and helps to eliminate toxins and high fat diets have also been 
linked to prostate problems. An absolute must is to increase zinc in 
your diet. Pumpkin seeds or pumpkin seed oils are high in zinc. Eat 
plenty of artichokes and asparagus; they are helpful in cleansing the 
prostate gland. Supplement your diet with calcium/magnesium; these are 
necessary for the gland to function normally. Bee pollen has been used 
to treat prostate problems in Europe since the early 1960's.  It helps 
to reduce the inflammation and infection. However you are advised to 
always introduce bee pollen to your body slowly, by taking tiny amounts 
initially and gradually increasing the dosage. Always check with your 
health care practitioner if you have allergies.  Saw Palmetto has strong 
anti-inflammatory properties and is used extensively in Germany for 
Benign Prostate Enlargement.

	All men over 45 years of age are strongly encouraged to have 
your family physician do a yearly digital rectal examination (DRE) 
of the prostate to determine its size. Also, a prostate-specific 
antigen test (PSA - a blood test) can be done to determine your risk 
of prostate cancer.  The Male Health Centres of Canada are currently 
evaluating a number of new oral treatments for Benign Prostatic 
Hyperplasia (BPH). Early diagnosis provides the best chance of treating 
prostate cancer successfully.

Section 4       Don't Do the "Holiday 7"
       		  by Greg Landry, M.S.

Copyright 1999, all rights reserved
-----
As the holidays approach, a frequent question from
my clients and subscribers is "How can I avoid
gaining weight during the holidays"? Their concern
is legitimate. The average American adult gains
seven pounds of fat between Thanksgiving and New
Years Day.

However, with a little know-how and effort you
don't have to be "average". In fact, I've seen
many people actually lose a few pounds over the 
holidays without depriving themselves. One of
my clients said it best, "Greg, I can't tell you
how good it feels to have lost three pounds during
the holidays instead of gaining ten pounds as I
used to do. My friends are jealous. It's January
2nd and I'm feeling (and looking) lean and mean.
And, best of all, I actually enjoyed the holidays
more because I always felt energetic. In years
past, inactivity and lots of food made me 
constantly sluggish and tired."

Here are a few tips that can bring you into the
new year without any new pounds...

1. Do some type of exercise everyday, preferably
every morning (see article Morning@Landry.com).
Now this can be as simple as a 15 minute walk 
some days but it's VERY important that you do 
something everyday. Physiologically, this keeps
your metabolism elevated, helps to control
your appetite, and ENERGIZES you!

Mentally, daily exercise increases your mental
acuity for hours after exercise, and it keeps you 
in a "healthy" frame of mind. Many people tell 
me that daily exercise helps them to make better 
food choices because it makes them feel like 
they are doing something healthy for themselves. 
Commit to doing at least 15 minutes everyday.

2. Don't deprive yourself of those holiday
goodies that you enjoy. Tell yourself that you
can eat whatever you'd like to as long as it's
in moderation. For example, eat one Christmas 
brownie instead of five. Take small bites of 
that brownie, chew it well, savor every bite
so you can really enjoy the taste rather than
rushing to swallow it. The same for meals,
don't deprive yourself of the foods you enjoy
but eat them in moderation and savor every
bite.

3. Have lots of "healthy" foods available at
your home during the holidays. Make a big
fruit salad to keep in the frig when you need
a snack. Have some of your favorite veggies
ready to eat for when you're hungry. Make a
big salad and keep it ready to eat in the
frig. 

4. Don't allow yourself to get too hungry. The
hungrier you are, the less control you have
over your eating. Always eat some healthy,
filling food before going to a party,
dinner, or any situation where you will be
exposed to lots of tempting food.

5. Strictly limit or avoid alcohol. Alcohol
is really bad news... I call it the "triple 
whammy"! it depresses your metabolism, 
stimulates your appetite, and it's loaded
with calories. Alcohol has as many calories
per gram as fat!

So, get energized with some daily exercise and
moderate food consumption and REALLY enjoy
the holidays... AND January 2.  :)

Section 5             Baked Sweet Potato Chips

Ingredients: 

     sweet potato 
     vegetable cooking spray 
     favorite spice (I use garlic salt or something called crazy 
		     salt) 

Directions: 

Heat oven to 350. Peel sweet potato (works with yams too) and 
slice thin, as if for a thick potato chip. Cover a cookie sheet or
baking pan with foil, sprayed lightly with vegetable spray. Lay 
sweet potato chips on the foil, rubbing each one slightly in the 
veggie spray. Then lightly spray the tops with veggie spray, 
sprinkly with your favorite spice. Bake for 20 minutes, turn, 
sprinkle that side, and bake for another 10 minutes. 

Make a lot, because EVERYONE including small children, SO's and 
teenagers who usually stick up their noses at healthy food, tend 
to like these.

               Polenta with Mushrooms and Tomatoes
        This is a contribution of J. Ari Kornfeld
             Reprint permission given by Renee from 
             Veggies Unite! - http://www.vegweb.com/
-----

Ingredients: 

     1/2 cup polenta (fine cornmeal, for those who always ask ;-) 
     1+1/2 cup water 
     8 large mushrooms (I used "gourmet" brown button mushrooms) 
     10 sun-dried tomato slices, dry packed 
     hot chile pepper to taste 
     balsamic vinegar 

Directions: 

Basic Polenta: 

Boil the water then drizzle the polenta into the swirling water. 
Mix in the pepper cover and simmer for around 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Pour mixture into a loaf pan (glass??) and let cool 
off. 

Recipe: 

Bake basic polenta in oven at 425(F) for 20-30 minutes, turning 
once. Chop mushrooms. Preheat a small frying pan using a medium 
flame, add balsamic. Vinegar as if it was oil (I am more generous 
with it than with oil), add mushrooms, stir, cover, and reduce 
flame to low for 10-15 minutes. Shake pan occasionally to mix. 
steam the sun dried tomatoes for around 5 minutes to rehydrate 
them chop sun dried tomatoes and add to mushrooms. Add water or 
balsamic vinegar if necessary (the mushrooms release alot of 
liquid in cooking.) Pour the "sauce" over the polenta and serve. 

The tomato/mushroom mixture is not really a sauce - by the time 
it's done there is little or no liquid left. Perhaps an 
adventurous person can try to work on that (add veg. stock & 
thickener?), it may be better as is, though. 

I created this the other night and it tasted great. As usual, this
is a very simple recipe. I found the the textures and taste of the
three main ingredients to be very complimentary. 

I prepared the polenta at the beginning of the week and 
refridgerated it until making the rest of the recipe. The basic 
polenta should keep for a week with no problem. 

The recipe is for two servings (great for single folk - I never 
prepare less than two servings) but should scale well. I would not 
consider the servings a full main dish but it would work well 
together with servings of beans or couscous, for example.
