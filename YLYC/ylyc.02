Your Life-Your Choice                                 November, 1997
=========================                               issue 2

In our last issue, a testimonial was submitted by a grandmother 
regarding her grandson's challenge with concentration and 
restlessness. If you missed the last issue, you will be able to 
see it in the archives at the Your Life-Your Choice Website 
headquarters; http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~b.synesael/yourlife.

Since that publication, I have received a great deal of 
correspondence asking which herbal supplements were so beneficial 
in calming him down and helping him concentrate. As the editor of 
this newsletter I have mandated that the articles, testimonials, 
and Choice's tidbits will NOT include industry specific brands. 
This is to protect the integrity and the quality of Your Life-Your 
Choice. However, I do want to promote value to Your Life-Your Choice
subscribers.

This particular combination is an industry specific product, so I 
will not mention the product name or that of the manufacturer. 
However, the main ingredients of this combination are Scullcap, 
Passion Flower, Valerian Root, Wild Yam Root, and Myrrh Gum. 

There are many herbal combinations that can be beneficial with this 
type of challenge. Ensure that the herbs you choose to purchase are 
of the highest quality; the manufacturer has a reputation for 
excellence, and the person you purchase from is knowledgeable.  

This newsletter is meant to educate and inform. It is not intended to 
diagnose or prescribe. As the editor of Your Life - Your Choice, I 
encourage you to consult with a reliable professional in your area in 
regards to any specific health issue.

Section 2.			TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

For many years I have taken care of my conditions: Inflammatory 
Poly Arthritis, Systemic Lupus, Erythematosus and High Bloodpressure, 
through very good medical drugs and very good doctors attention (and 
some painkillers).

About 2 years ago, a terrible pain developed in my left side, much 
worse than I ever experienced. It felt as if a knife was plunged right
underneath my ribcage, producing a sharp pain both in front and back. 
For months there was no way to sit or lean back, it was too painful 
to lie down, and standing or walking was almost impossible. The pain 
was so strong, I was bent over double.

Twice being admitted in the hospital for a battery of tests, done by 
the best physicians in the city, didn't bring any relief for me or 
answers for the doctors.

Back at home I decided to take homeopathic herbs. I have always been 
in favour of natural medicine and occasionally used some with good 
results. I started taking  concentrated doses of herbs to build the 
immune system and cleanse the blood. The pain is now gone and has not 
come back in the past year and a half. Specifically, my success was 
due to Una de Gato, Red Clover and a specially designed supplement 
for women.

Another benefit is now emerging; I need to take less prescribed 
medicine for my conditions, supplemented by regular doses of herbs.  
I am fine today.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I have always been a die-hard smoker. Ask anyone who knows me. I had 
been smoking since I was 16 (1'm 40 now)... and I enjoyed it.

A friend of mine mentioned that her husband really wanted to quit 
smoking, but couldn't, and asked if the herbal company that I distribute 
for had anything that could help. I told her that we did have an herbal
combination that is meant to be helpful for this, but I'd never tried it 
and could not speak to the effectiveness of it. The conversation brought 
out the curiosity in me, so I bought some for myself. I wanted to see 
what it would do for me knowing that I HAD NO INTENTION OF QUITTING.

I am pleased to report that I haven't had a cigarette since Sept 6. I can 
say with total conviction that this specific combination eliminated the 
nicotine craving. I am amazed at how much easier than expected, this has 
been.  Not that it hasn't been a challenge. The nicotine is not a problem, 
but I've found that I still have to keep my hands and mouth busy; I eat 
lots of sunflower seeds (they're high in fiber), and chew sugarless gum. 

Herbs can be helpful in quitting smoking. Taking herbal toxin 
eliminators will help remove the toxins from your body while your 
quitting and help reduce the withdrawal time.

Section 3.		The Art and Science of Reflexology
 			    by Deborah Carwana RN. RNC

Deborah is a Registered Nutritional Consultant as well as a 
registered nurse. Realizing the benefits that alternative 
treatments can offer, she has also pursued certification as 
a Reflexologist and an Aromatherapist. Deborah Carwans has her 
own health consulting business local to London, Ontario and can 
be contacted for further information or to arrange an appointment 
at:  (519)672-7997.
  
	Reflexology is a science based on the principle that there are 
reflexes in the hands and feet that corresponds to every part of the 
body. Through the application of pressure on these reflex points several
benefits can be achieved as the body's own healing powers are encouraged 
to restore and maintain health and well-being, naturally.

	Reflexology reflects the idea that natural life energy flows 
through our body along zones or meridians running the length of the 
body from head to toe to reflexes in the hands and feet, and all the 
organs and parts of the body lie along one or more of these zones.
	
	Stress and tension cause blockages or congestion along these 
zones, circulation becomes sluggish, blood and oxygen supply to every 
cell is decreased and our bodies re no longer functioning optimally - 
we are no longer in balance. This imbalance can manifest itself as a 
tender spot on the foot signaling that the corresponding area of the 
body may not be operating at peak performance.

	It has been suggested that 75% of all illness and dis-ease is a 
result of the stress we live with. A reflexology treatment provides 
deep relaxation, a release of tension, improved circulation and, 
theoretically, an opportunity to cleanse the body of toxins and 
impurities.

	Reflexology is effective and helpful in normalizing many 
different body conditions. For many people reflexology has been 
helpful for painful, chronic conditions such as arthritis, headaches 
and insomnia. Women have found childbirth easier - labour is shorter 
with less discomfort when receiving reflexology for a period of time 
before the birth. It is also very supportive for the post-natal period.

	The reflexology session takes place in a safe, quiet and relaxing 
area. You are usually positioned in a reclining chair or on a therapy 
table. The reflexologist works on your bare feet and the session usually 
begins with a series of warm-up exercises. All the reflex points on both 
feet are worked using finger and thumb pressure. A complete treatment is 
always given as the body is to be considered holistically. The session 
ends with a relaxing foot rub using lotion or oil.

	Reflexology will not harm you in any way; it simply brings your 
system back into balance. Clients report a range of experiences after a
treatment from deep relaxation and tranquillity to a feeling of being 
centered and focused. There is a sense of rejuvenation and renewed energy. 
Many people fall asleep during a treatment or find that their sleep 
improves at night. A session usually lasts about 45 minutes to an hour. 
(For babies, the elderly or extremely ill the length of the session and 
the pressure applied is decreased.) For acute conditions a treatment can 
be given every 48 hours. For chronic conditions weekly sessions are 
recommended. Monthly treatments are used for prevention, maintenance 
and general relaxation.

	It is interesting to note that in Denmark, Reflexology is the 
most common alternative treatment used. 1 out of every 4 Danes chooses
reflexology as the preferred health care treatment. There is also 
emphasis on researching the efficacy of reflexology in the workplace 
where back pain, sore muscles and aches are common. The results are very
positive; showing a decreased in work hours lost which translates into 
dollars saved. As a result reflexologists are being hired to work for 
many different companies as part of their wellness programs.

Section 4.			Stopped Cold: 
Echinacea Is The Hot New Remedy That Has Herbal Medicine Fans All Atingle 

                     	By Tracy L. Pipp 
				The Detroit News 
			Wednesday, February 19, 1997 

Many people don't know where it comes from. Not everybody can spell it. 
But that doesn't stop them from taking echinacea, the hottest herbal 
remedy around. It's become as acceptable as vitamin C for fighting off 
the common cold. Users swear that taking echinacea at the onset of a 
sore throat or runny nose lessens the severity and duration of their 
symptoms. Not a bad reputation for an herb with a name that's dauntingly
unpronounceable. 

Echinacea (eck-in-ASIA) used to cower in the dark corners of nutrition 
and health food stores. But its newfound popularity means you can now 
find bottles of it at your local drugstore. "A few years ago, no one 
had heard of it," says Marguerite Smith of NutriLite products. "It wasn't 
even mentioned in the industry top 10 list of what people were buying. 
Now it's selling like crazy." 
               
Echinacea was used by Native Americans for generations to treat a variety 
of ailments -- everything from snakebites,  toothaches and coughs to
inflammations and infections. Today, researchers concur that echinacea 
can reduce swelling and has prominent antibiotic and antiviral properties. 
The renewed interest in the extract of the coneflower is due to 
echinacea's role as an immune system stimulant. "There's a well-documented
history of echinacea's power to boost the immune system and its ability to 
treat a wide variety of conditions," says Wayne Silverman of the American
Botanical Council. And, judging by sales, lots of Americans are trying it 
out. "It's consistently one of our most popular products," says Stacey 
Hessen, manager of Betty's Grocery Store in Birmingham. The store sells it 
as a tincture and in capsule form In liquid form, it should tingle on your
tongue -- if it doesn't, the active ingredient is too diluted to be 
effective. And it's better to take it only when you need it, for no longer 
than a week at a time: Various studies indicate that echinacea is most 
effective when it is only taken when sick and not used as a preventive 
measure. 

Dr. Charles McCloskey, director of outpatient care at Oakland General 
Hospital in Madison Heights, says several German studies indicate that 
echinacea does indeed strengthen the immune but that no such studies have 
been done in the United States. But despite the lack of U.S.-based 
evidence, "some patients swear by it," he says. 

Some of echinacea's allure stems from its natural origin and its lack of 
side effects, McCloskey says. "I don't know anyone who has overdosed on
it." This mainstream popularity is sparking new interest in herbal
remedies, and experts believe the success of echinacea could be just the
thing to clear 
a path for other herbs and natural fix-its.

Section 5.	       The Bath - A Place To Honour Ourselves
				by Deborah Carwana RN. RNC

Deborah is a Registered Nutritional Consultant as well as a registered 
nurse. Realizing the benefits that alternative treatments can offer, 
she has also pursued certification as a Reflexologist and an 
Aromatherapist. Deborah Carwans has her own health consulting business

	Aromatherapy: a natural healing art that uses richly aromatic 
oils extracted from plants to tone and regulate the body, and ease the 
mind and spirits. The effect can be either relaxing or stimulating and
refreshing depending on what oils are used. Modern research has proven 
the health-giving qualities of different plant essences, for example 
the antiseptic properties of tea-tree, the soothing effects of lavender, 
and the head clearing properties of eucalyptus. The therapeutic effect 
of these oils is achieved either by inhalation or absorption through the 
skin. They can be mixed into ointments and lotions, in bath or massage 
oils, on compresses or in vaporizers. Blending them together in different
combinations will give the best results. For example, an invigorating 
blend of basil and rosemary can be used in a vaporizer in the workplace 
or home to enhance memory and stimulate the mind. Insomnia can be overcome 
with a warm soothing bath to which a blend of lavender and sandalwood has 
been added or with a few drops of essential oil of neroli on your pillow.
	
	The hectic lifestyles of the 90's have encouraged many of us to 
turn to a shower for daily hygiene and the bath has been relegated for 
the use of the infirm and children. But what a waste of an accessible 
tool for our own wellness. A bath allows a retreat. A place where we can 
honour ourselves, our bodies, and by using essential oils in our bath, 
enhance our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being.
	
	A further benefit of the aromatic bath is that the essential oils 
do not remain in the body, unlike some chemical drugs, and depending on 
the oil used and the health of the body, will be totally expelled in 
between three and fourteen hours.

	The easiest way to add essential oils to the bath is to completely 
pour the bath and, just as you are getting into in add 8 to 10 drops of an
essential oil. In this way you will receive all the benefits of the 
essential oil inhaled. Another method is to first add a carrier oil, such 
as sweet almond or apricot kernel oil to your blend of essential oils and 
then add to your bath. This is much more luxurious and combats any 
tendency to dry skin. One can create blends to reduce stress, to 
revitalize yourself after a tough day, and to address specific physical
concerns.

	An added benefit to your aromatherapy bath would be to combine it 
with a massage. In aroma-massage the therapist gently massages the 
essential oils which are diluted in a carrier oil into your skin. For 
those who want a more therapeutic bath and to eliminate toxins, a blend 
of essential oils can be ground into a base of mineral/Epsom salts… a 
wonderful tonic to start or end the day.

	There are always precautions when using essential oils. Oils of 
cinnamon, clove, basil, peppermint, thyme, wintergreen or sassafras 
should never be used in a bath as they may irritate your skin. Pregnant 
women and people with epilepsy should consult with an aromatherapist 
before using any essential oil or blend of oils. Those used with children 
should be diluted four times the adult formulation and should be made 
from only the gentlest of oils (neroli, rose) and never used without a 
carrier oil.

	Whether you choose an aromatic bath for romance or to nurture 
health and well being, the combination of water and oil is a delightful 
mix.

			Hope For Migraine Sufferers

	For those who suffer from migraine headaches, there may be new 
hope. The November/December issue of Health magazine reported that a 
Belgian study showed vitamin B2, or riboflavin, "remarkably reduces the 
number and intensity of migraines."
	"Forty-eight migraine patients were divided into two groups. The 
first group received 400 milligrams of riboflavin every morning in a 
single dose - the equivalent of sitting down to 600 bowls of Cheerios 
with milk. The second group received the same amount of riboflavin along 
with 75 milligrams of aspirin. This treatment continued for three to five
months. At the end of the study, nearly 80 percent of all patients had 
fewer than half the number of migrain days they had experienced before
treatment, and the severity of the headaches was reduced by about 
two-thirds. The aspirin apparently provided no additional relief."
	The report goes on to say that researchers are hoping their results 
can be duplicated, even with a lower dose of riboflavin.
