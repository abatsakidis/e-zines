Section 2.			TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

This is my story:  I had dramatic results years ago following the
cellular  nutrition program of one specific health company.  I was
taking a long term medication for a deterioration of the stomach lining,
and wasn't happy with the results, or the fact that I was taking a
drug.  Therefore I sought herbal remedies and found the answer for me. 
I was able to stop taking my medication within days, and never looked
back.  You can imagine how pleased I was to suddenly be living pain
free, and in the meantime, I lost a few pounds!  At the same time, my
husband was also on the general nutrition program because of various
aches and pains, and he had very dramatic results as well.  Most of 
his back pain is gone, as well as the pains in his knees, and the most
remarkable part was that his face (and body) almost completely became
acne free.  We didn't expect his acne to be affected!  To this day we
take the products, as well as our children and family and friends, and
those old problems have never come back.  As well, we almost never get
colds or flu.  Lastly, the weight-loss program is great!  After both my
pregnancies I had stubborn fat to lose, and followed the program
correctly, and lost all the weight I was interested in losing, in a
health amount of time.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I thought I felt good and didn't need dietary supplements. After 
all didn't Americans have the most expensive urine in the world, 
from to many vitamins, etc. just  passing through?  I was skepticle. 
But my wife got ahold of some nutraceuticals and convinced me to try 
them. I told her I would if she put them by my plate at meal time. 
About 2 weeks later I couldn't believe how good I felt. I felt 20 
years younger, had so much more energy and the chronic back stiffness 
I had, (it would take 5-10 min. of exercises to stretch my back 
muscles before I could bend over enough to get my socks on), was 
gone.  This is a specially formulated carbohydrate complex which, 
among other things, contains the functional and stabilized component 
of the Aloe Vera plant. I've been of the stuff for 5 months now 
and have all my kids on it and would be afraid to stop taking it.  
Every one I talk to about this stuff has similar results. I sure 
reccomend it.

			--------------------
	

Allergies come in many forms and all are miserable to suffer from. 
An allergy is an inappropriate and exaggerated response by the body's 
immune system. Otherwise harmless substances cause an overreaction of 
the white blood cells in an attempt to fight the invading substance.

The substances that cause the overreaction are called allergens. 
Allergens can be any substance. Common allergens include dust, pollen, 
drugs, chemical, metals, and food additives. Others include mold, 
certain foods, animal dander, and grasses.

The initial response is to identify and avoid the offending allergen. 
Since this may not always be possible let's investigate what else can 
be done to eliminate or make allergies more livable.

An unbalanced body is a major factor in the allergic response that is
elicited to an allergen. Therefore, holistic healing practices such as
chiropractic and acupuncture can be very beneficial in this regard. 
These healing arts should not be looked upon as a "cure" for allergies 
but rather as modalities to be used in normalizing overreactive aspects 
of the body. Information is available on these healing arts at:
http://www.activator.com/ for chiropractic and at: 
http://www.acupuncture.com/ for acupuncture.

Rotation and elimination diets are helpful in the area of food allergy.
Occasionally a ketogenic diet such as that found in the book, "Dr. Atkin's
New Diet Revolution" by Dr. Robert C. Atkins can be helpful. If the
carbohydrate reduction on such a diet offers some relief then investigate
the possibility of a Candida Albicans (yeast) infection. For a discussion
of Candida go to http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/Spa/3477.

A major factor in any allergic situation is liver congestion. This
situation is also known as "sluggish liver". This is not a liver disease
but rather a situation whereby the liver is not performing its blood
cleansing function at maximum capacity.

The liver acts as the "oil filter" of the body. It cleanses the blood of
waste products, poisons, and toxins so that they may be removed from the
body. When the liver becomes overloaded it cannot perform this function 
at 100% capacity. This reduction in cleansing allows poisons and toxins 
to remain in circulation in the blood stream. These circulating poisons 
make tissues, such as mucous membranes, very sensitive to allergens or
irritants. Substances that may not have been an allergen before now 
become one due to these hypersensitive tissues. The liver can become 
sluggish because of poor dietary habits, alcohol or drug use (both 
illegal and prescription drugs are toxins), or disease. Environmental
pollutants can be toxic to the body.

A large spectrum of nutritional support has been investigated for use 
in helping to alleviate allergic reactions. Niacin, Pantothenic acid, 
Vitamin B6 and B12, Vitamins C and E, Calcium, magnesium, oleic acid, 
linoleic acid (GLA), and fish oils (EPA) have all shown promise in 
certain aspects of allergy symptom relief.

Education and experimentation are the key to reducing or eliminating
allergy symptoms.

Section 5.			Ginkgo Biloba

Throughout most of its medicinal history, the leaves and fruit of the
Ginkgo tree have been used for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory,
and vasodilatory effects. Today, concentrated and standardized Ginkgo
biloba leaf extracts have largely replaced the more crude dried leaf
preparations. The primary therapeutic use is now enhancement of
various CNS functions such as short-term memory, concentration and
alertness, particularly in the elderly. Indeed, most of the recent 
research concentrates on brain function and cerebral circulation. A 
summary of more than 40 recent clinical trials investigating the effect 
of GBE on cerebral insufficiency has been published.(5)

Standardized GBE administered for 4-6 weeks at a dose of 120 mg/day
showed impressive positive results in almost all trials conducted. One
interesting double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving 48
patients between the ages of 51 and 79 tested the effect of GBE (120
mg/day) on general cognitive function.(6) The results showed that the
Ginkgo treatment group had a significantly shorter stimulus-recognition
time compared to controls. Other studies in healthy subjects have
documented improvements in short-term memory and other mental
abilities, such as improved concentration after taking GBE.(7) One
long-term aging study utilizing 166 subjects showed a significant
improvement in behavioral and clinical tests following three months of
GBE treatment.(8) 

The cognitive and behavioral effects of GBE may benefit certain forms
of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The efficacy of GBE in
Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia was assessed in a recent
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter study
involving 216 patients.(9) Randomized groups received either 240 mg/day
of GBE or a placebo and were assessed after a 24-week treatment
period. Results based on a multidimensional evaluation tool indicated
significant positive effects of GBE in both forms of dementia.

Few, if any, significant side effects have been documented. Rarely,
gastrointestinal disturbances, headaches and allergic skin reactions have
been reported. However, these side effects usually arise following
prolonged administration. A small number of cases of bilateral subdural
hematomas have been reported and putatively linked to prolonged use
of GBE (up to two years).(24,25) Ginkgo biloba's ability to inhibit
PAF-induced platelet aggregation could prolong bleeding time and
should be considered, especially when other anticoagulant drugs,
including aspirin, are given.

Although Ginko biloba has been shown to inhibit platelet-activating
factor, there seems to be little evidence in the literature that indicates
problems with prolonged bleeding when it is taken in the usual
therapeutic doses for short periods of time. Because there has been at
least one report demonstrating a prolonged bleeding time associated with
chronic Ginkgo biloba treatment (daily intake for a two-year period), it
seems prudent to exercise caution, especially when taking Ginkgo biloba
along with other herbs or drugs known to have anticoagulant effects.
When used judiciously in appropriate patients, however, Ginkgo biloba
appears to offer a number of promising benefits.

Section 6.			Patchouli Essential Oil

	Reprint permission granted by Kelly Smith from Frontier Herbs

Some would say that patchouli is the most distinctively fragranced herb 
in the botanical kingdom. The first whiff of its rich, exotic scent never 
fails to become fixed forever in the olfactory memory. 

The plant that produces this remarkable aroma is a tropical member of the
lamiaceae family. Distant relatives include lavender, rosemary and many 
other herb plants associated with more temperate regions. Patchouli seems 
to have moved south and suffused itself in the mysterious aromas of a dark 
and steamy jungle while retaining a hint of the sunny, herbal fragrances 
of its northern Mediterranean cousins. 

Patchouli was first described by botanists in the Philippines in 1845.
Today growing interest in its fragrance has led to patchouli¹s widespread
cultivation throughout tropical Asia.

It wasn¹t long before patchouli oil¹s remarkable staying power made it 
an important fixative ingredient in the manufacture of fine perfumes and
cosmetics. A fixative is a substance that combines well with the other
ingredients in a blend, slowing down the evaporation of the fragrance 
and making it last longer when applied as a personal essence. The 
increased demand helped create an industry of patchouli farming and
distillation in tropical Asia that persists to the present.

Newly distilled patchouli oil has a fresh, green, slightly harsh aroma. 
As the oil ages it mellows considerably, becoming sweeter and more 
balsamic. Patchouli is one of very few oils that, like fine wine, 
improve with age. High quality patchouli oils emit a suave, fruity,
wine-like top note when uncapped. Other oils that age well are 
sandalwood and vetiver, both of which blend quite nicely with patchouli.

Patchouli is most often used in aromatherapy. The dried leaves and 
stems are employed in traditional Chinese medicine to normalize the 
flow and balance of the life force known as qi (or chi.)

An aromatherapy blend inspired by the traditional Chinese use can 
evoke a feeling of gentle clarity and inspire the harmonious flow 
of emotional energy. It uses oils with balancing and mildly energizing 
aromas.

Harmonious Energy Flow Blend: 
              28 drops patchouli 
              28 drops lavender 
              29 drops bergamot 
              10 drops clary sage 
              5 drops rosemary 

Add three drops of this blend to 1 ounce vegetable oil and use as a 
massage oil.

In aromatherapy patchouli is often used as a relaxant. The warmth and 
depth of its aroma make it comforting and relaxing. Patchouli's relaxing
attributes, coupled with its rich and exotic nature, have led to its 
inclusion in sensual and amorous blends, particularly appropriate for 
products like massage oil. For these applications patchouli combines 
well with ylang ylang, jasmine, sandalwood, vetiver and rose. Let your 
senses and personal tastes guide you in creating a concentrated blend 
of these sensual oils. Or use patchouli alone as a sensually evocative 
and deeply relaxing fragrance. Patchouli's distinctive scent can always 
be relied upon to evoke a marked aroma-therapeutic response.

Section 7.			CHOICE TIDBITS

     Asthma, The Seventh Ranking Chronic Disease in the United States 
				By Sonja Call 

	The disease affects 13 million Americans, and is triggered by 
substances or events which cause the airways leading to the lungs to 
become more inflamed or swollen than usual.
	In recent years, asthma seems to have become more common, 
especially among children. Symptoms of asthma are found in approximately 
10% of the children in the western world. It is the leading cause 
of chronic illness in children, and the leading cause of school 
absenteeism attributed to chronic conditions. In most cases, symptoms 
of asthma become much less serious and much less frequent as a child 
grows older. 
	Asthma is usually an inherited disease and is not contagious. 
There are some very effective treatments for asthma.
	The first line of treatment should always consist of controlling 
your environment by reducing your exposure to the "triggers". For 
example, carpets should be vacuumed regularly, bed linens changed as 
often as possible and pets, such as dogs and cats, should be at least 
banned from the bedroom. Smoking should be permanently banned in an 
asthmatic child's house.
	Secondly, alternative therapies can make asthma milder and easier 
to handle. Traditionally, Chinese ephedra has been used to help with 
asthma. Ephedra has been known to help clear the lungs.
	Vitamin B complex and Vitamin C are also helpful.

					Colds  
			November/December Health Magazine

	An article in the November/December issue of Health magazine 
listed some suggestions on how to defend yourself against a cold.
	One suggestion was to take vitamin C and other supplements. 
Elliot Dick, chief of the Respiratory Virus Research Laboratory at 
the University of Wisconsin, has studies that show that taking one 
500 milligram tablet, four times a day, is all you'll need.
	The article also states that echinacea is also a good bet and 
that there are a number of German studies that backed up the herb's 
claim to be a mild immune system stimulant capable of fending off colds.
