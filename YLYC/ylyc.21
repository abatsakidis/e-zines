Section 2    "Complementing Magnetic Therapy With 
		The 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet."
				(part one)

			By Dr. Boyce N. Berkel

This report is written by Boyce N. Berkel, M.D. It is 
condensed and adapted, by permission, from Dr. William 
H. Philpott's book "Magnetic Health Strategies."  Dr. 
Philpott is currently doing FDA approved research in 
Magnetic Therapy, and is taking applications. For more 
information on this timely and fascinating subject, go 
to http://www.uniquenterprises.com/html/mt.htm

~~~~~~~~~~

The 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet is presented in a 3-part 
series. In part one you will find out the physiologic basis 
for the diet. In part two you will find out specifically what 
the diet consists of, and how you can use it to prevent or 
reverse degenerative changes in your body. In part three you 
will find out how to manage food and other addictions that 
play such a major role in the development of degenerative 
diseases. 

You have learned that degenerative diseases are caused by 
maintaining your body over a long period of time, in an 
acid/low oxygen state.

You have learned that the you can prevent and reverse 
degenerative diseases by maintaining your body in an 
alkaline/high oxygen state.

You have also learned in this series, that Magnetic 
Therapy plays a major role in maintaining your body 
in an alkaline/high oxygen state, thus preventing and 
reversing degenerative diseases. 

Today you will learn how foods affect your body's state 
of acidity and alkalinity, and how by following a 4-Day 
Diversified Rotation Diet you can maintain an alkaline/ 
high oxygen state in your body, and so complement 
Magnetic Therapy.

Classically, maladaptive reaction to foods, chemicals, 
and inhaled substances are part of and central to 
degenerative diseases whether physical or mental. 
Maladaptive reactions to food compose a majority of 
these acute symptoms produced, as well as the longer 
term degenerative disease symptoms. Comparing acute 
symptoms with the chronic symptoms of degenerative 
diseases reveals that the symptoms of chronic diseases 
are simply a time extension of acute maladaptive 
reactions.  The metabolic mechanisms of acute maladaptive 
reactions are the same as the chronic symptoms of 
degeneration. Central to this biological disorder 
producing symptoms is the production of acidity with 
its associated reduction of oxygen (acid-hypoxia)....  
Here is a quick review-

The central disorders of acute maladaptive reactions are: 
1) acidity, and 
2) low oxygen. 

Monitoring the biochemical disorders of chronic degenerative 
diseases reveals the same disorders as acute maladaptive 
reactions which are acid-hypoxia. Chronic degenerative 
diseases are observed to be acute maladaptive reactions 
extended in time to a chronic state with the resultant 
cellular damage. The contrast between the well cells of 
the healthy, functioning person and the sick cells of 
degenerative diseases provides valuable clues as to how 
magnetics can substantially aid in recovery of inflammatory 
degenerative diseases, infections from microorganisms and 
cancer.

Chemical energy is exchanged in all living cells through 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a compound that contains 
hight energy phosphate bonds. In the process of oxidative 
phosphorylation, that is adding these phosphate bonds to  
produce adenosine triphosphate ( ATP), molecular oxygen 
accepts an electron and becomes free radical oxygen 
(superoxide). If not immediately enzymatically reversed, 
superoxide proceeds to produce other free radicals, 
peroxides, oxyacids, alcohols and aldehydes. These are 
all inflammatory. The oxidoreductase family of enzymes 
have the assignment of making ATP by oxidative 
phosphorylation and at the same time, processing the 
reduced end-products of this oxidation phosphorylation 
activity. This oxidoreductase family of enzymes are 
alkaline-hyperoxic-negative magnetic field activation 
dependent. When these 3 physiologically normal factors 
are not present, then  ATP is made by fermentation. The 
3 factors necessary for fermentation to produce ATP are: 
1) acidity, 
2) lack of oxygen, 
3) a positive static magnetic field as an enzyme energy 
activator. 

Your cells have the capacity to make ATP by either 
oxidative phosphorylation or fermentation. Cellular 
fermentation producing ATP only functions in the abnormal 
state of acidity and hypoxia. The enzymes catalyzing 
fermentation production of ATP are tranferases which are 
acid-hypoxic-positive static magnetic field activation 
dependent. Sugar is catalyzed by transferase producing 
ATP, alcohols, acids and carbon dioxide. Hydrolase 
enzymes catalyzes starches to sugars. Hydrolase also 
is acid-hypoxic-positive static magnetic field energy 
activation dependent.

There are specific (oxidoreductase enzymes) non-phosphorus 
(non ATP) static magnetic field enzyme energy activation 
and specific ATP energy activated enzymes. When oxidative 
phosphorylation catalyzes the production of ATP, this 
catalytic reaction makes negative static field magnetism 
termed oxidation remnant magnetism. This negative static 
magnetic field is available to energize oxidoreductase 
enzyme catalysis and at the same time, block transferase 
and hydrolase catalysis. Besides the biological available 
negative static magnetic field from oxidation remnant 
magnetism, there is an always present electrostatic field. 
In an alkaline medium the electrostatic field produces a 
negative static magnetic field which energizes oxidoreductase 
catalysis. In an acid medium, an electrostatic field produces 
a positive static magnetic field which in turn energizes 
transferases and hydrolases. Both oxidation phosphorylation 
and fermentation catalysis are static magnetic field 
energized. However, they are energized by opposite magnetic 
poles. Oxidation phospharylation is energized by a negative 
static magnetic field in an alkaline-hyperoxic medium. 
Fermentation is energized by a positive static magnetic 
field in an acid-hypoxic medium. A static magnetic field 
is required for the enzyme and the substrate to attach. 

ATP made by fermentation with its acid-hypoxic medium 
cannot maintain human biological life energy. ATP made 
by fermentation can maintain the life energy of 
microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, 
parasites and cancer cells. The secret to reverse 
acute maladaptive symptom reactions, prevent and 
reverse microorganism infections, maintaining human 
biological health and providing for the reversal of 
degenerative diseases is to maintain a normal alkaline 
body pH, hyperoxia and an adequate negative static 
magnetic field. The biological response to a negative 
static magnetic field can maintain these necessary 
components of healthy human cells . Thus it can be 
understood that exposure to an external source of a 
negative static magnetic field supports human
health and materially aids in reversal of inflammatory 
degenerative diseases, cancer and the defense against 
microorganism invasion. This external negative static 
magnetic field can be applied to local affected areas 
as well as applied systemically by such as a negative 
static magnetic field bed pad.

The secret of preventing or reversing both the disease 
process and /or aging is to initially avoid foods, 
chemicals and inhaled substances which are causing the 
acid/low oxygen state. This is largely related to foods 
that you are eating  twice a week or more often. 

Five types of maladaptive reactions have been isolated. 
These maladaptive reactions produce both acute symptoms 
and the chronic symptoms of degenerative diseases. These 
maladaptive reactions are:-

(1) Immunologic Reactions. These produce antibodies and 
complement complexes which are inflammatory. They comprise 
a minor percentage of maladaptive reactions. 

(2) Oxidoreductase enzyme deficiency.  The oxidoreductase 
enzymes are necessary to produce biological life energy by 
oxidation phosphorylation producing ATP and oxidation 
remnant negative poled magnetism. The biological life energy 
consists of enzyme catalytic production of 
(a) adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
(b) oxidative remnant magnetism (a negative magnetic field). 

This oxidation/reduction enzymatic response is dependent 
upon alkalinity and molecular oxygen (alkaline-hyperoxia). 
These oxidoreductase enzymes also process the end products 
and by-products of oxidation reduction metabolism which are 
free radical oxygen and further production of either free 
radicals, peroxides, oxyacids or aldehydes. These inflammatory 
substances are enzymatically processed by oxidoreductase 
enzymes releasing oxygen back to its oxidative molecular state. 
These oxidoreductase enzymes are all alkaline dependent. The 
enzyme activator can be either a static electric field or a 
negative magnetic field. The movement of electrons between the 
enzyme and the substrate (free radicals, peroxides, oxyacids,
 and aldehydes), during the catalytic reaction, produces a 
negative magnetic field. This production of the negative 
magnetic field due to this catalytic reaction occurs with 
all oxidoreductase enzyme catalytic reactions. The production 
of this magnetic field is measurable. Furthermore, a negative 
magnetic field can magnetically cause the enzyme and the 
substrate to join, thus serving as the energy activator of 
oxidoreductase enzymes.

The nutritional precursor of oxidoreductase enzymes of 
necessity needs to be present. However, an excessive amount 
of these nutrient enzyme precursors have no ability to serve 
as an energy activator of these enzymes. The conditions 
necessary for the catalytic response of the oxidoreductase 
enzymes are: 1) Adequate amounts of enzymes made from the 
nutrient precursors, 2) An alkaline medium since these 
enzymes are alkaline dependent, 3) An energy activator 
which can be either a) a static electric field, or b) a 
negative magnetic field. Clinical observations provide 
convincing evidence that a negative magnetic field can 
activate oxidoreductase enzymes even in the presence of 
a moderately malnourished state.

(3) Oxidoreductase enzyme inhibition. This is a state in 
which there are adequate oxidoreductase enzymes whose 
response capacity has been trained down. This enzyme 
inhibition state develops because of repeated and prolonged
 development of acidity due to maladaptive reaction to foods, 
chemicals, or inhalants. This acidity is largely a result of 
maladaptive reactions to frequently used foods. The frequency 
of eating a food more often than each four days is central to 
the development of oxidoreductase enzyme inhibition. It 
matters not whether these maladaptive reactions are immunologic 
or non-immunologic in origin, the reaction is always the same, 
and that is, the production of an acid-hypoxia. Dr. Philpott 
has tested thousands of these maladaptive symptom-producing 
reactions of all types and have found them all to be 
acid-producing. It is the acidity that produces the symptoms. 
Acidity causes the cells to swell and reduces the availability 
of oxygen.

There is good clinical evidence that oxidoreductase enzyme 
inhibition is the major cause of maladaptive symptom-producing 
reactions. Furthermore, since all types of maladaptive 
reactions are acidifying and since acidity inhibits 
oxidoreductase enzyme function, there exists oxidoreductase 
inhibition in all types of maladaptive reactions.

The answer to this state of oxidoreductase enzyme inhibition 
is to: 
1) provide an alkaline medium in which the enzymes can 
function, and 
2) provide a negative magnetic field to energy-activate these 
enzymes. 

You will find it  interesting to note that a negative magnetic 
field provides for both the alkalinity by direct action on the 
bicarbonate buffer system and also the energy activation of the 
oxidoreductase enzymes.

(4) Addiction. It is the acidifying addictive withdrawal 
phase of an addiction that is the culprit. This occurs 
three to four hours after exposure to the addictive 
substance. There are two types of addictions 
(a) from an external narcotic source, and 
(b) self-made narcotics (endorphins and enkephalins) 
produced by the stress of frequent exposure to non-narcotic 
substances. 

Thus frequently used foods, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, 
etc. which in themselves are not narcotics, but addicting 
when used frequently (two or more times a week). Narcotics,
both external and internally self-made, are symptom 
relieving, since all narcotics are alkaloids, and thus 
alkalizing. Thus, while under the alkalizing influence 
of the narcotic,, the oxidoreductase enzymes are 
adequately functional. when the narcotic is metabolically 
used up, and therefore not present, then a state of 
acidity develops and oxidoreductase enzyme inhibition 
sets in. Thus, in the acid-hypoxic addictive withdrawal 
state with its free radicals, peroxides, oxyacids, and 
aldehydes, symptoms develop. The type of symptoms depend 
upon the specific tissue involved in the maladaptive 
reaction. The answer to reversal of the acute symptom 
reactive tissue state is to expose this area to an external 
source negative magnetic field.

(5) Toxins. Toxins are enzyme poisons which are a complete 
block of oxidoreductase enzyme function. Many toxins are 
strong acids or evoke acid production in the human body. 
Insect stings and reptile bites are powerful acids. 
Pesticides are toxic to humans as well as insects. Our 
industrialized civilization produces toxins such as 
petrochemical exhaust from combustion, formaldehyde, etc. 
The major necessary measure of handling reaction to toxins 
is avoidance. The second most important method of handling 
toxins is to provide a negative magnetic field for the 
production of an alkaline medium and the activation of 
the oxidoreductase enzymes, thus oxidatively processing 
these toxins out of the body and activating the enzymes 
that will reverse the acid-hypoxic state.

Years of experience of deliberate food testing has provided 
convincing evidence that it is the stress of the frequency 
of contact (that is exposure to foods more often than twice 
a week) that produces the maladaptive reactions to these 
foods. This is true, whether these are lgG immunological 
reactions or non-immunological reactions. The frequency 
needs to be more than two times per week. A practical food 
rotation diet can be set up, avoiding any food eaten as 
frequently as two times a week or more. Initially, avoid 
these foods for three months. Ninety-five percent of the 
time, after three months of avoidance, these initial foods 
left out of the diet can be introduced back into the 
four-day diversified rotation diet without symptoms being 
produced. Gluten from wheat, rye, oats, or barley causes 
the most frequent and most serious food producing reactions. 
Dairy foods and corn products come in for a good second. 
Any food used frequently can become a reactive substance. 
The same principle of frequent contact producing maladaptive 
symptoms applies also to chemicals and inhaled substances.

You can proceed with a 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet 
without food testing. This is found to be adequate for 
the majority of people. Chemicals do have to be considered, 
even such as car exhaust, natural gas or a drug or hormone 
that has been ordered by your physician. A 4 Day Diversified 
Rotation Diet initially leaving out these foods you commonly 
use, usually works quite well in reversing the disease 
process. The 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet can later 
incorporate these foods back into the diet after three 
months if they are eaten on a four day rotation basis as 
well. Ninety-five percent of the time, these foods can be 
re-introduced without producing symptoms. The 4 Day 
Diversified Rotation Diet should become a lifestyle.

***

Next month, in segment two of this series, you will find 
out the specifics of the 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet, 
and how you can use it to prevent or reverse degenerative 
changes in your body, as well as the aging process.

Section 5   	 Those Horrible, Hungry, Happy Holidays

~~~~~~~~~~

With the holidays upon us it is probably wise to take a 
few moments to reflect on some ways we can nutritionally 
survive them. So, here are some tips that may help you 
have happy and nutritious holidays:

* Try not to use artificial coloring to
decorate your baking. These colorings
are known to cause problems in people
with allergies and sensitivities. Use
raisins, almonds, even colorful bits of
fruit and vegetables (yes, vegetables --
no one will even be able to taste a
little bit of carrot or squash that is
used for a snowman cookie's nose, button
or eyes). Want to be really creative?
Use strong colored fruits and vegetables
in your batter recipes to completely
change the color!

* Instead of milk use rice or soy milk.
Again, a problem with allergies and
sensitivities that many people aren't
even aware of can cause all sorts of
problems. Rice milk is very agreeable in
taste.

* Instead of processed sugar use honey.
Admittedly sugar is sugar regardless of
its source.  At least you avoid some of
the problems associated with the
processing and natural sugar is a bit
easier for the system to break down and
use.

* Instead of white flour use a wheat or
whole grain flour. Processed flour, even
though it claims to be "enriched," has
been robbed of its nutritional value.

* Use hot herbal teas with cinnamon
strips instead of sugared hot drinks,
sodas and/or coffee. Read the labels
carefully; there are many very good
herbal teas on the market. One brand
that we've had good success with is
Celestial Seasoning.

* Limit the amount of sweets in general.
Perhaps the best advice here is to call
upon that "old" song by Gary Puckett and
the Union Gap (I am dating myself,
aren't I?): "Baby, will power . . ."

* Avoid preservatives, coloring,
flavoring, flavor enhancers and
artificial sweeteners. If you can't
pronounce it (on the label) don't use
it!

* Try creating holiday drinks from
unsweetened fruit juices and
concentrates. Sweeten naturally with
honey and fresh cinnamon. Most fruit
drinks/punches have at best 10% real
fruit juice and are loaded with sugar,
coloring and preservatives.

* Rediscover popcorn, the kind you pop
yourself! This lets you control the
amount of oil and salt that is used.
Remember all the ways you used to
decorate for Christmas with popcorn? Let
your kids create the same memories for
themselves, too.

* Use "good" whole wheat bread -- no
preservatives, sugar, corn syrup or
caramel coloring. Avoid white bread (see
"white flour" reasons above).

* Avoid as much meat as possible - be
kind to your intestines!

* Supplement your diet with digestive
enzymes and probiotics. We all tend to
overeat during this fun time of the year
and most of us are already deficient in
the enzymes necessary to break down our
food properly. Acid indigestion, that
bloated feeling, flatulence can all be
better controlled by the use of
additional enzymes and probiotics. All
health food stores carry multiple brands
of each. Some are better than others so
read the label carefully or email us at
wellness@primary.net and we can let you
know some of the brands we've found to
be more useful.

* Be creative!

Nobody likes a grinch at Christmas nor the puritanical 
pilgrim at Thanksgiving, so be careful how you present 
your "requests" for better eating to the rest of your 
family. If you are preparing the food for the festivities 
you can implement most of these tips without even telling 
your family! What better present could you give them!

Good eating during the holidays!

			FIG BARS- Holiday Health
			
			By Howie Thomason RNCP


This recipe makes a large quantity so you may wish to cut 
it in half. For a large party it is great the way it is. 

Filling;

3         pounds of figs
1.5       cups of water

Dough;

3         cups whole wheat pastry flour
2         cups rice flour
1         teaspoon of nutmeg
3/4       cup of oil (cold pressed)
1         egg     
1/2       cup honey (unpasteurised)
2         teaspoons of vanilla


Yield;    40 Bars
Time;     One hour

1; To prepare the filling, place the figs and the water in 
a large kettle. Cover the kettle and cook the figs till they 
are soft, stirring often. 
             
2; Puree the cooked figs in a food processor or blender 
(a little at a time), Add additional water if necessary to 
obtain a consistency similar to that of jam or apple butter.  
Set the filling aside while you make the dough. 
             
3; Mix together the flours and nutmeg. Work in the oil with 
your hands. In a separate bowl, beat together the egg, honey, 
and vanilla. Then, using a fork, work the honey mixture into 
the flour mixture to make a stiff dough. 
             
4; Divide the dough in half. Roll one half of the dough 
directly into an unoiled 11 1/2 by 17 1/2 cookie sheet. 
Spread the filling over the dough.
             
5; Roll the remaining dough out between two sheets of wax 
paper to make an 11 1/2 by 17 1/2 rectangle. Carefully 
peel off the top sheet of wax paper. Pick up the dough by 
the bottom paper and place it over the filling. Peel off 
the wax paper.  
              
6; Cut the top dough into 3 by 1 1/2 bars, then prick 
each bar three times with the tines of a fork. Place on 
the middle rack of the oven and bake at 350 F for 20 
minutes. 
             
7; When the bars are baked, cut them all the way through, 
but don퉡 remove them from the pan until they have cooled.
