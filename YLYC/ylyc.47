Section 1             Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 

                        by Christina Barrett 
                        mailto:cbr@glinx.com

All too frequently nowadays, we hear about Carpal Tunnel 
Syndrome. And all too frequently we all know someone who has 
had to resort to surgery to correct the problem. Sometimes 
the surgery is successful and the person is never troubled 
again by the numbness and pain. Unfortunately for others, the
surgery is unsuccessful, and the pain recurs. In many cases, 
physiotherapy has proven helpful, and sometimes chiropractic 
medicine does the trick. In others, massage therapy is the 
ticket to freedom.

Massage treatment for carpal tunnel mostly involves work to 
the forearm muscles, especially to the flexors (the muscles 
that curl your fingers into fists and bend your hand towards 
your forearm). When these muscles are tight, feeling hard and 
resistant to pressure, they often close down on the nerves 
that supply your hand. A massage therapist skilled in this 
work, can loosen the muscles, increase the circulation 
through the area and free up the compressed nerves. Combined 
with exercises for you to do at home and at work, this can 
lead to a reduction, and in some cases a complete cessation 
of symptoms. 

Because quite a few of the muscles involved attach at the 
other end to the lower part of the humerus (the bone of the 
upper arm), it is important to work through there, too. 
Working on the attachments of the muscle should stimulate a 
relaxation response in the belly of the muscle. I like to 
combine this work with a deep kneading of the muscle itself, 
feeling the fibres loosen and relax under my fingers. It’s 
very satisfying to feel a muscle go from feeling like a 
bronze casting of a muscle to being soft and pliable, to see 
the client’s reaction as the numbness starts to subside and 
the pain to recede. 

In addition to the work described above, I use deep thumb 
stroking of the tendons where they cross the wrist from the 
hand down into the forearm, giving them a good stretch as I 
go. Part of my training involved learning how to mobilize the 
bones in the wrist and hand, and I use those techniques, too, 
on the theory that movement is life, and the more freely the 
bones and muscles can move, the happier and healthier a body 
is. When I feel that I’m starting to push the envelope to the 
point that the muscle is on the verge of being irritated, I 
switch to the muscles on the back of the forearm. It’s 
important to keep a balance, I believe, and when one group of 
muscles is tight and pulling, it usually causes strain on the 
counter group (the antagonists). Therefore, no treatment is 
complete without addressing the arm, the body, the person as 
a whole and not a small dysfunctioning part. 

To maintain the free movement, I also use passive stretching 
of the forearms, and show the client how they can do these 
exercises at home to stay loose and functioning properly. I 
also recommend wrist supports for those who use a keyboard a 
great deal, and try to find other helpful suggestions for 
other clients in jobs with repetitive wrist motions. In this 
part of Nova Scotia, there are quite a few people working "in 
the fish," employed by the fish factories cutting and 
processing fish. This involves long hours of standing on a 
concrete floor, reaching for a fish, then using a small, 
sharp knife to cut it apart, remove the innards and bones, 
and pass it along the line. Many of these workers suffer 
terribly from carpal tunnel syndrome, and need to be able to 
work when the fish comes in. The work is seasonal and 
unpredictable, so quite a few of these hard-working laborers 
try to come in for maintenance to keep them functioning 
during the season. 

There are some very good books out there on treating and 
avoiding carpal tunnel: 

1 - Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: And Other Repetitive 
Strain Injuries - Sharon J. Butler, Jacqueline Entwistle 
Freeman (Illustrator); Paperback 

2 - Repetitive Strain Injury : A Computer User's Guide - Emil 
Pascarelli, Deborah Quilter (Contributor); Paperback 

3 - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Repetitive Stress Injuries: The Comprehensive Guide to Prevention, Treatment and Recovery 
- Tammy Crouch; Paperback

I hope anyone suffering from this condition will consider 
trying massage and other therapies. How much nicer to have 
relief without resorting to surgery unless it is absolutely 
unavoidable. 

Happy recovery.

Section 2     Ten Steps to a Healthy Prostate
		     by Dr. John Maher
	        http://www.RxforWellness.com 
----------

One out of five men 50 years old has cancer cells replicating
in his prostate. Three out of four have palpable 
inflammation. At 75, three out of 5 have active prostate cancer. 

Prostate cancer is the number 2 cancer, behind skin cancer, 
in men, and the number 2 cancer killer in men, behind lung 
cancer. Prostectomy usually leaves one impotent and wearing 
diapers. SO, HAVE I GOT YOUR ATTENTION? 

The historical medical understanding is that this 
dysregulation of cellular division is in response to 
increased levels of dehydroxy-testoterone, a metabolite of 
testosterone, that tends to increase with age. DHT, as it is 
commonly called, is thought to be related to male pattern 
baldness as well. 

Indeed a treatment for advanced prostate cancer is a 
gonadectomy, a polite word for castration, in an effort to 
lower testosterone! But more and more doctors are beginning 
to suspect estrogen metabolites (like 16-hydroxy-estradiol), 
xeno-estrogens (estrogen mimics, usually petro-chemical 
pollutants), and "exogenous" estrogens in meat products, 
might be part of the picture as well, if not the major 
factor! 

One of the concerns of young men raising their testosterone 
with steroids or with "stacking" androstenes, DHEA and 
tribulus terrestris is the tendency for the body to turn them 
to estrogens instead of testosterone, especially once 
testoterone levels exceed optimal. (This is why Chrysin, aka 
flavone X, is often stacked as well as this herb resists 
estrogen formation from androgenic hormones.) The short term 
effect might be "bitch tits", but the long term side effect 
could be prostate cancer! 

Many natural health doctors also feel that the risk of 
prostate cancer is higher if progesterone is low. (Less than 
25 pg/ml progesterone in saliva is considered too low by most 
experts in both men and post-menopausal women.) Just as 
progesterone protects women who take estrogen from breast 
cancer, it appears that progesterone protects men from 
prostate cancer by perhaps a similar mechanism. 

The Wellness Rx: Ten Steps for a Healthy Prostate. 

1) Lots of sex is good for the prostate, although promiscuity
may lead to infections and prostatitis. Indeed, three orgasms 
a week in males is strongly correlated with longevity (and 
optimal testosterone levels I'll wager)! 

2) Vit. E, up to 400 IU and selenium, 200 mcg. is protective.
Zinc, 30 mg., further supports prostate and testicular 
health. So do the fatty acids in flaxseed, pumpkin seed and 
walnuts. 

3) Lycopenes are an anti-oxidant phytonutrient found in 
tomatoes, watermelons and pink grapefruit, that are prostate 
supportive. 

4) Keep DHT low by taking herbs that are "5-alpha reductase 
inhibitors", such as saw palmetto and nettles*. 

5) These two herbs above are also "anti-aromatases", thereby 
inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Chrysin* 
does this as well and should be considered by those 
endeavoring to boost testosterone if estrogens are high 
normal. If already high, lower estrogens BEFORE trying 
to boost testosterone, by using the above herbs, and 
following step 6 below. 

(Normal estradiol in saliva* in men under 50 is 1 to 3 pg/ml;
over 50, 1 to 5 pg/ml. For post-menopausal females, .5 to 1.5 
pg/ml. Yes, less than a man!) 

6) Keep exposure to outside estrogens down with pure water 
and cutting inorganic meats. Keep the "bad" estrogens further
at bay with the cruciferous vegetables ( cabbage, 
cauliflower, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, collards, kale, 
rutabaga, turnips and turnip greens), which help your liver 
detoxify them. (They contain indoles, called DIMs for short) 

7) Eat lots of "phyto-estrogens", which are plant foods that 
contain weak estrogens, such as soy products, beans, legumes,
apples, alfalfa, and flaxseeds and whole grains. These plant 
estrogens take up the receptor sites (think of these as 
parking spaces) for the more powerful "bad" estrogens. 

8) Enhance progesterone* if it is below 25 pg/ml in saliva. 
Progesterone products may have female sounding names, but men
need just as much progesterone as post-menopausal females do! 

9) Exercise has been shown to decrease the risk of prostate 
cancer by 25%! 

10) Once past 50 have yearly DRE (digital rectal exams) and 
PSA's (prostate specific antigen blood tests) performed by 
your M.D. Keeping your sex hormones at optimal levels, while 
at the same minimzing the levels of the "bad" sex hormone 
metabolites, is a key step in anti-aging and life extension.

Section 3    Nutrition and Disease: Osteoporosis 
                      By: June Kaminski RN MSN 
-----

 This week we will continue our discussion about how a 
balanced diet can help you and your family prevent chronic 
disease. This week, our focus will be on one of the most 
serious and damaging diseases: osteoporosis. This disease is 
more prevalent in women, but men do get it. Osteoporosis can 
be prevented or reduced significantly with balanced diet, 
regular exercise and fresh air, and a supportive social 
network. 

Osteoporosis Prevention 

The best form of calcium is food sources, simply because 
bone, like other tissues, requires balanced nutrition. In 
particular, milk is the best food source of vitamin D, a 
nutrient essential for normal calcium absorption and bone 
health. Milk and dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt and 
ice cream, contain the highest levels of calcium. Although 
many people tend to avoid milk because of its fat content, 
which might predispose them to heart disease, especially 
those with hypercholesterolemia, low-fat dairy products such 
as skim and 1% milk are safe and contain high levels of 
calcium.


Nondairy food sources of calcium generally contain much lower 
levels, but significant amounts occur in canned salmon and 
sardines when the bones are also eaten. Some green vegetables 
(such as kale, broccoli and spinach) as well as legumes (such 
as soybeans and common beans) have small amounts of calcium, 
but it is not easy to assimilate. 

Vegetarians who do not consume milk products should take 
special care to ensure that they are receiving adequate 
amounts of calcium in their diets. Some people will find it 
hard to obtain the recommended amounts of dietary calcium 
through diet alone; for many, a combination of food sources 
and vitamin/mineral supplements is wise. 

Adequate amounts of vitamin D are also needed for optimal 
calcium absorption and bone health. Although many families 
obtain sufficient vitamin D through the exposure to sunlight, 
adequate dietary sources of vitamin D are particularly 
important for elderly people or for those who use sun screen 
preparations routinely. A dietary intake of 400 to 800 IUDs 
is recommended for such people. 

Daily Requirements of Calcium 

Age in years  		Intake (mg)  
7 to 9  		700  

10 to 12 boys  		900  
10 to 12 girls  	1200 to 1400  
13 to 16  		1200 to 1400  
17 to 18  		1200  
19 to 49  		1000  
50+  			1000 to 1500

Section 4	The Recipe Corner

The following recipes are good sources of calcium and are 
recommended for those suffering from Osteoporosis. 
Reprint permission given by Renee from Veggies Unite! - 
http://www.vegweb.com/


		Black Bean & Tofu Soup 

Ingredients: 

1 1/2 cup black beans 
8 cups water 
3 strips Kombu 
2 cloves garlic 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
2 tablespoons olive oil 
1 bay leaf 
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil 
1 head broccoli 
1 big carrot 
1/2 medium onion 
2 stalks celery 
1 1/2 cup spinich 
2 tablespoons soy sauce 
1/8 cup green onions 
8 oz. tofu 
4 medium mushrooms 

Directions: 

Serves 6-8. 

Wash the beans. Put the water, the beans, the salt, the bayleaf,
the kombu, both kinds of oil, and the soy sauce in a large pot.
Crush the garlic and put that in too. Bring it all to a boil and
then turn down to a simmer. Let this brew cook for about 2 1/2 
to three hours. In the last hour of cooking, throw in all the 
sliced veggies except for the green onions and the tofu. When 
the soup is done (i.e. the beans and carrots are soft) sprinkle 
green onions on top. 

Comment: kombu is a kind of seaweed. It makes good soup stock 
and also improves the digestability of beans. You can find it at 
most natural-food stores. Also, this makes for a very hearty 
soup. If you want something less dense, cut down on the veggies.
This recipe is pretty robust; changes can be made and it will 
still turn out OK (less oil, salt, etc). Enjoy!

		Easy "Kick-Butt" Pate 

Ingredients: 

1 cup raw sunflower seeds 
1/2 cup cornmeal, kamut or amaranth flour 
1/2 cup engivita or nut. yeast 
3 tsp. parsley flakes 
1/4 cup sunlower oil (or any) 
1 1/2 tsp. dried bazil 
1 1/3 cups water 
1tsp. crushed dried thyme 
2 Tbsp. tamari (or Bragg's) 
3/4-1tsp. sea salt 
3-4 tsp. prepared horseradish 
1/2 tsp. dried sage leaves 
1 Tbsp. Saurkraut (opt.) 
1/4 tsp. sea kelp  
1/2 tsp. ground mustard 
1 cup finely grated potato 
(rinse thoroughly & squeeze this makes it less starchy) 

Directions: 

Make sure you rinsed the potato (through a colander or any kind 
of nylon cloth or cheesecloth. Put everything in a blender 
except potato, blend for a bit...add potato, blend some more, if
it isn't mixing add a l'il more oil (or olive juice). 
Preheat oven to 375* F. Oil a 9" glass pie plate and scoop in 
pate...OR DOUBLE recipe and put in a loaf pan. Bake 35-45 mins 
until well browned. You can really alter this recipe say by 
using nuts in combo or alone adding olive juice instead of oil 
to help mix- just make sure it has a sticky consistancy. 

Let pate cool for about 20 mins (the longer the better up to 2 
hours). Then serve on bread or crackers. Keeps for a week or can
be frozen in wedges. 

Serves: 4 
Preparation time: 55 mins
