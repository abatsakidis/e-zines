Letter From the Editor

Here's a subject that is not often discussed, but is
becoming more accredited in light of it's success. Sound
Therapy is used in hospitals, schools, and psychological
treatment programs. Sound and music can have a very
powerful effect on an individual's health. It is an
effective treatment to reduce stress, alleviate pain, and
lower blood pressure, among many other ailments. There
aremore than 5,000 registered music therapists in the
United States. Music therapy is also recognized by the
Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations.

Now... how does it work and what can it do for you?

People respond to sound vibrations in 2 ways; Rhythm
Entrainment  and Resonance. There is evidence that the
rhythm of a person's heartbeat will adjust itself to that
of an external sound source. This could include the
rhythmic pulse of music, the hammering of a neighbour
making repairs or the humming of your furnace. This action
is referred to as Rhythm Entrainment. Different frequencies
or pitches of sound stimulate the body to vibrate in
various areas. This is known as Resonance. Typically, low
sounds resonate in the lower body parts, whereas high
sounds resonate in the higher body parts.

The health benefits of Sound and Music Therapy are
countless and very diversified. Music therapy offers
numerous benefits to Alzheimer patients. It can improve
mood, reduce the need for medication, and may prevent
deterioration by stimulating the brain.

A study led by Dr. Frederick Tims of Michigan State
University and published in the November 1999 issue of
Alternative Therapies showed that patients with Alzheimer's
Disease who underwent four weeks of structured music
therapy showed significant increases in their level of
melatonin, a neurohormone linked with sleep regulation and
believed to influence the immune system.

Another study examined the effects of music therapy on 30
older  adults diagnosed with depressive disorder. Those
assigned to the treatment group who underwent at-home music
therapy on a weekly basis performed significantly better on
standardized tests for depression and also reported less
distress, a better mood, and more self-esteem than the
untreated control group.  A study of 38 adults who arrived
in the emergency room with cuts large enough to require
stitches were randomly assigned to undergo the procedure
with or without music. The group with music reported
significantly less pain during the procedure.

A study of music therapy in 25 elderly people with sleep
disturbances revealed that music therapy improved sleep
patterns in 24 of the 25 subjects.  There has been
significant success with Sound Therapy in helping  those
with autism learn to communicate.

Naturally, there is a complete science to the specific
types of sounds  and how specific areas of the body and the
brain are influenced by  those sounds. Clearly it is much
too involved to do proper justice in  a single article.
However, I do encourage you to further your research  on
the subject of Sound and Music Therapy. Can you think of a
nicer way to cure what ails you?

                 "Mindful Massage Therapy"
                              by Laurel Duran, CMT
                      http://www2.amigo.net/bluecord

In today's world, professional massage therapy is more
commonly accepted  as a holistic healing modality than ever
before, and the public demand for  trained professional
massage therapists is increasing daily. In order to  meet
tomorrow's even greater demand for skilled certified
massage  therapists, competing massage schools are offering
prospective students a  vast array of bodywork and holistic
health techniques that encompass much  more than the
anatomy/physiology, Swedish (deep muscle medical) massage
techniques, and passive/active exercise basics. The
curricula of many  certified massage schools also include
courses in Polarity energy therapy,  Shiatsu, Reiki, Chi
Gong, cranio-sacral techniques, injury
assessment/treatment, pregnancy massage, infant massage,
sports massage,  lymphatic drainage techniques, herbology,
aromatherapy, nutrition, yoga,  meditation techniques and
biofeedback just to name a few. While energetic  young
people are entering the potentially lucrative and
fulfilling career  of massage therapy, so are some
experienced business professionals also  leaving corporate
jobs for attractive new careers as certified massage
therapists. I believe this trend suggests a gradual,
natural change of  direction in our health care because it
is driven by consumer choice.  In the 21 years I have been
in private practice as a massage therapist, I  have
received many different kinds of massage myself. Regardless
of what  formal techniques the therapist uses, I believe
there is one single skill  that I want my massage therapist
to apply to the massage I receive. That  skill is
"mindfulness".

Mindfulness means more than paying attention to the client
during the  massage hour. To me, massage therapy is a
compassionate conversation  between the client and the
therapist, conveyed through the therapist's  hands.
Physically, a good therapist's hands seem to intuitively
speak to  the clients' soft tissue, responding to their
resistive or painful energy  pockets with kind acceptance.
Mindfulness means giving one's full  attention to
intuitively sensing and meeting the client's unique
therapeutic needs in the present moment.

When a client first comes to me I begin by querying them
about their  health history. I find out what health
challenges they are currently  facing, and I ask them "What
led you to come for a massage today?" As they  describe
their personal reasons and physical tensions, I intuitively
observe their entire energy field so that I can perceive
where their energy seems blocked. If I intuitively sense
their body's energy could be blocked  in a certain area
they have not mentioned, I ask them about it.

When I begin to administer the massage, I listen to them -
to their body,  their words and their feelings - with my
rational mind and my intuition.  This mindfulness guides
where I place my hands and how I respond to their  unique
need with my hands. When I first touch the client, I
intuitively  apply an amount of pressure and motion that
will be immediately acceptable to them. After a while, as
they begin to trust what my hands are saying,  they begin
to surrender and allow themselves to safely fall into a
deeper state of non-resistance. In other words, they begin
to "unwind". When  this happens I can feel the change. If
they want me to go deeper into  their soft tissue to help
solve their tension and pain problems, I am able  to delve
in more deeply, without counter productively forcing
excessive  pressure on them, causing their soft tissue to
resist by contracting. I  can only sense my client's
unconscious soft-tissue responses by paying full
attention. If I were chatting with my client about my life,
I would lose  focus. If I used my captive-audience client's
therapy hour as an  opportunity to pour out my personal
troubles to her, I would not only be  reducing my client’s
unwinding potential, but I would be behaving  unethically
by using my client for my OWN purposes without her consent.
Respecting the necessary boundaries in any
client/therapist relationship is  essential to achieving
the session's healing goal.

I take my responsibility to each massage client very
seriously. I  personally feel that administering massage
therapy not only carries high  standards of
professionalism, but it carries an even greater spiritual
responsibility. The moment I step over the threshold of my
massage  treatment room, I enter into a potentially
miraculous world of healing. I  leave my own personal needs
behind me as I focus all of my attention on my  client's
needs in the moment. In an instant of mindful choice, I
become a  neutral conduit for God's unlimited healing
power. When I use mindfulness  as my guide, massage therapy
sessions cross over the illusionary boundaries  between
body, mind and spirit, and become the reality of holistic
healing!

         Top Dog - For Nervous and Hyperactive Pets

Some pets are by nature excitable, worriers, and/or
hyperactive. They may need a little help to relax and
"smell the roses", if you will. The following herbs are
helpful in situations such as these and a carefully
measured combination can help "soothe your anxious pet".

Black Cohosh is a powerful herb and helpful for all nervous
conditions, fits, convulsions and spasmodic afflictions.
Hops is an excellent nervine and will promote sleep.
Lobelia is a powerful relaxant, can be experienced
throughout the body.  Scullcap has a calming effect
especially for pets who worry and brings about a natural
sleep.  Mistletoe is not just for smooching under at
Christmas time. It  will quiet, soothe and tone the nerves
of your anxious pet.

A formula similar to this would be helpful given to an
animal the day before going on a trip. For hyperactive
breeds I would put drops in the pets water everyday to slow
them down just a bit. St. John`s Wort also is effective for
some nervous problems. Vitamin E supports the nervous
system and Lecithin helps to strengthen the myelin sheath
thus helping nervous disorders

            Tea Tips- Green Tea Soothes Skin

Soaking in a mixture of green tea and oatmeal can be a
wonderful way to soothe and tone sensitive skin, according
to an article entitled "Natural Beauty: Five Rejuvenating
Home Remedies" in Prevention magazine
(http://www.prevention.com).

"A green tea bath is a delicious way to unwind after a
stressful day," Audra Senkus and Gabrielle Ophals, owners
of Haven, a New York City day spa, told the magazine.

Just combine one-half cup of loose green tea leaves with
one-half cup of rolled or instant oatmeal in a muslin or
cheesecloth bag. Tie up the bag and steep it in warm water
as you fill the tub. Then remove the bag and soak yourself
for a delightful 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse, towel,
moisturize.

As with every tea time, don't forget to use a new mix each
time!

         Spring Cleaning - Don't Forget Your Body!
                    by June Kaminski, RN MSN
                 http://www.visionsofadonai.com

Spring is becoming a reality in many parts of the Northern
Hemisphere - a time of rebirth, renewal and spring
cleaning. By all means, spruce up your environment, your
home, your wardrobe. But don't forget your most intimate
environment of all - your body.

In many cultures, through many ages, spring cleansing has
been a fact of life. Its the time of year to shed any
congestion, built-up toxins and give your digestion, liver
and energy level a good boost and cleaning. During the
winter we tend to eat a more acidic diet, such as high
protein foods which can cause the intestines to secrete a
heavy mucous coating. This means the intestine is not able
to absorb nutrients as well. Too much acidic food also
cause the intestines to harbor harmful bacteria. These two
problems can lead to constipation and autointoxication.
This causes the intestines to re-absorb toxic materials
back into the blood stream.

This causes strain on the liver which eventually can't keep
up with the blood needing detoxicification. When the body
is overburdened with toxins, the liver may be stressed
causing symptoms such as allergies, headaches, nausea,
irritability, foggy thinking, muscle tension, skin
eruptions, itching and fatigue. In women, PMS, fibroid
tumors, and endometriosis are signs of liver stress, since
the liver must process excess estrogens out of the
bloodstream. This is where spring cleansing fits in. You
can give your intestines and liver a break by helping them
get rid of the built-up toxins.

There are many different ways to engage in spring body
cleansing. This week we will address a few of the most
common ones. Give them a try, if you're so inclined. You'll
likely feel more energetic,. lighter, with less aches and
digestion troubles. Don't go off on any tangents though -
tonics and cleansing diets are great, but don't let them
impede your ingestion of the necessary nutrients your body
needs for day to day repair and maintenance. These
suggestions are meant to supplement your normal healthy
daily diet, not substitute for them.

Dr Elson Haas suggests using the Master Cleanser method of
internal body cleansing. This includes the doctor's recipe:

The Master Cleanser
2 Tablespoons of fresh lemon (or lime) juice
1 Tablespoon pure maple syrup
1/10 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 ounces of spring water
Read more about the
Cleanser at http://www.elsonhaas.com/article/spring.html

Dine on Spring Morsels  Several wild and natural foods are
wonderful spring tonics. Try one or more of the following.
If prepared right, they are delicious and oh, so
nutritious, full  of enzymes, minerals and other nutrients,
as well as having cleansing properties.
1. Dandelion leaves
2. Sorrel
3. Nettles
4. Yellow dock
5. Red Beet
6. Watercress are all wonderful tonics for the liver,
bringing renewed strength and vitality to the body.
7. Barberry
8. Milk Thistle
9. Red Clover
10.Burdock are herbs that are excellent for cleansing
the liver and gall bladder, which boost the digestive
and immune systems.

Herbs for Intestinal Cleansing  Two herbs Psyllium and
Cascara Sagrada are wonderful cleansers for the intestines
and colon. Psyllium (Plantago ovata seed and husk) is a
bulk natural laxative -- its mucilaginous action cleanses
the intestines. Psyllium also reduces low density
lipoproteins ("bad" cholesterol) and normalizes blood sugar
levels. Cascara Sagrada (Rhamnus purshiana bark) stimulates
the intestinal lining and relieve a sluggish colon. The
combination of both Psyllium (as a bulking agent) and
Cascara (as a stimulant laxative) is a wonderful colon
cleanser.

Chinese Spring Medicine  In Chinese medicine, spring is the
season of the wood element, corresponding to the liver and
gall bladder. The liver governs the smooth flow of energy
in the body and for cleansing and storing the blood. Gall
bladder problems frequently show up in the spring, often
brought on by fatty foods such as dairy (especially
cheese), fried foods and red meat or pork. Indigestion or
nausea following eating, pain under the right rib cage
toward the stomach, or radiating pain between the shoulder
blades are all signs of a stressed gall bladder.

In spring, the body moves into a cycle of rebuilding and
cleansing various organs and systems. Just as sap rises in
the trees, our bodies need to move upward. We need to
cleanse the past toxins from our bodies and minds and
rebuild. In doing so, we move beyond "the trunk of the
tree". The organs rebuilding and cleansing in spring are
ones located high up in the body. During the season of the
Wood element, energy is focused on the liver and gall
bladder. March 11 through May 22 is the Wood Element
Season. Later, the Fire element season begins during the
last month of spring and the energy moves on to the heart
and small intestines, including the circulatory and
endocrine systems. For extensive further reading on Chinese
spring cleansers and health boosters, visit Julia Chang's
site at http://www.sensiblehealth.com/

Now is the time of year to focus on YOUR state of health
and well being. If you're like most of us, it's time for some
inner cleansing. Combine the use of fresh spring greens
with the herbs mentioned as well as plenty of water, exercise,
fresh air, steam baths and skin toning to help your body
purify itself and prepare for the warm summer months ahead.
You'll only feel better for it - full of renewed energy and strength,
ready for healthy energetic frolics and warm weather fun.
