----------

The 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet is presented in a 3-part 
series. In part one you found out the physiologic basis for 
the diet. Last month in part two you  found out specifically 
what the diet consists of, and how you can use it. Today in 
part three you will find out how to manage food and other 
addictions that play such a major role in the development of 
degenerative diseases. 


This completes the series on the 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Magnetic Management Of Addictions

What Is An Addiction?


Addiction occurs when there is a production of symptoms 
occurring on the withdrawal of a narcotic. The classic example 
is the chronic frequent use of cocaine. When the narcotic is 
high in the body, there is a mental high with euphoria and 
disordered judgement. Three to four hours later, when the 
narcotic is low, there is a mental low, depression, and again 
disordered judgement. Note that the ingested narcotic suppresses 
the body's own production of narcotics. Thus, in addiction, 
there is a roller coaster type of mental high without pain, 
followed by a mental low with pain.

Human metabolism has an acute stress response reflex. When an 
injury or other acute stress is present, there is a rise in 
serotonin in preparation for action.  At the same time, this 
acute stress raises self-made opiate polypeptides (endorphins) 
to reduce the physical or mental pain of the stress. When the 
acute stress state keeps being frequently evoked so as to be 
chronic or near chronic, this counter-stress response fatigues 
and no longer evokes the production of endorphins and serotonin. 
This sets the stage for food addiction. 

Foods are eaten, which trigger the production of Serotonin 
and self-made narcotics. There develops a roller coaster 
type of too little, below normal amount of serotonin-opiate 
response to the fatigue response. This is relieved by eating 
a food which evokes the serotonin-opiate anti-stress reflex,
producing more than a normal amount of serotonin and opiates. 
Thus, the addiction roller coaster state of food addiction is 
perpetuated. 

All addiction, whether to exogenous narcotics or 
endogenous self-made opiates due to a food stress 
reaction, have biological deteriorating consequences. 
The symptom producing the withdrawal phase 
characteristically starts at 3-4 hours post-meal and 
if a food is not eaten to raise the serotonin-opiate 
complex, the symptoms will worsen through the next 
three days. By the fourth day, the withdrawal symptoms 
are diminishing and by the fifth day, they are 
characteristically gone. 

There is a percipient rise in body acids during this 
withdrawal phase which normalizes back to a biologically 
normal alkaline state by the fifth day. Dr. Philpott's 
knowledge of this comes from thousands of patients that 
he has tested for a five day period. Blood and saliva 
was tested for the pH. The addiction phenomena is 
reversed by the fifth day following a fast after which 
food maladaptive reactions evoke acute symptoms within 
the first hour of eating a meal of the single food being 
tested.


THE SEQUENCE OF FOOD ADDICTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

Addictive Withdrawal Phases

Blood sugar is frequently low, when physiologically normal 
serotonin-opiate complex is low.  This occurs characteristically, 
3-4 hours after the meal. During this withdrawal phase, there 
develops anxiety, tension, depression, physical and mental symptoms. 
Pain often develops.


Addictive Relief Phase

Food relieves the symptoms and the pH normalizes to a normal 
alkaline pH. Serotonin-opiate complex rises beyond normal. 
Anxiety, tension, depression, physical and mental symptoms 
and pain disappear. Euphoria and impaired judgement develop. 
Blood sugar normalizes and or sometimes, is higher than normal 
at 1-2 hours after the meal.

Addiction is deteriorating with the end stage being 
maturity onset type diabetes mellitus and it's 
numerous physical and mental complications. 
Characteristically, before the development of diabetes 
mellitus Type II, there are several years of food 
withdrawal symptoms that occur at 3-4 hours, post-meal, 
associated with hypoglycemia. At 24 hours post-meal, 
there often is a hyperinsulinism which precedes the 
hypoglycemia occurring at the 3-4 hour level. This is 
the compensated stage of maturity-onset type diabetes 
mellitus. After several years, the hyperinsulinism 
fatigues and stops at which time the blood sugar stays 
up overnight. At this stage, when the blood sugar stays 
up overnight, the diagnosis of clinically significant 
diabetes mellitus Type II is made. Finally, in the late, 
late stage, the insulin production drops so low for a 
few people, that insulin is given as a practical 
management of the diabetic state. This is the sequential 
story of how maturity onset type diabetes mellitus develops.

THE DIMENSIONS OF ADDICTION
THE ROLE OF NARCOTICS

There are exogenous narcotics serving a useful purpose 
in medicine to relieve pain. These are such as morphine, 
Demerol and others used in medicine. By law these are 
used under the judgement of a physician. There are a 
number of exogenous narcotics used illegally to produce 
pleasurable euphoria and altered mental states. Cocaine 
is an example. The human body makes endogenous narcotics.  
These are termed endogenous polypeptide opiates, and are 
given the name endorphins.


THE ROLE OF SYMPTOM RELIEF

There is a physiological level of endorphins that 
is not addicting. In case of a stress-injury emergency 
there is a pain protection of an acute rise in endorphins 
along with a rise in synaptic junction transmitters 
(norephrinephrine, ephrinephrine, serotonin) ready for 
fright, flight or fight. If and when these stress type 
injury responses occur frequently, there then develops a 
state of endorphin addiction with a typical physical and 
mental symptom relief and euphoria phase when endorphins 
are higher than normal and a symptom (pain, anxiety, 
depression, weakness) phase when the endorphins are 
lower than normal.

The endogenous opiates producing a self-made state 
of addiction can be evoked by numerous non-narcotic 
physical and chemical stressors. Tobacco, caffeine, 
alcohol when frequently used can be stressors evoking 
endorphins producing addiction. Frequently eaten foods 
can become stressors evoking the production of endorphins. 
Alcoholism is addiction to the foods from which the 
alcohol is made. Alcohol interferes with the selective 
absorption of foods and thus there is a four times 
increase in the development of addiction to foods from 
which the alcohol is made and also the same problem 
exists when using alcohol with the foods that are eaten. 
Gambling with its euphoric expectation of winning can 
become an addiction due to the physiological response of 
increased endorphins.

Addiction with its disordered metabolism leads to 
degenerative diseases especially, Type II diabetes 
mellitus.


THE ROLE OF ALTERED JUDGEMENT AND DISORDERED AFFECT

Addiction with its pleasurable excitement phase followed by 
its painful withdrawal phase trains in an addict an obsessive-
compulsive neurosis. There develops a compulsion to seek a 
pleasure phase and avoid the painful phase. Thus, there 
develops a learned compulsion to seek the narcotic, tobacco, 
alcohol, caffeine, amphetamine, symptom relieving food, 
pleasurable anticipation of winning while gambling and so 
forth. Judgement becomes distorted, affect disordered and 
hostile aggression expressed when the goal of pleasure 
seeking is interfered with. The addicted person becomes 
self-centered and incapable of reasonable interpersonal 
relationships.


THE ROLE OF DISORDERED METABOLISM

The withdrawal phase of addiction to narcotics or the 
self-made endorphins due to non- narcotic stressors is 
a state of acid-hypoxia. This is painful and leads to 
symptoms. Brain function is interfered with by this 
acid-hypoxic state leading especially to depression and 
weakness. Target tissues that have either been injured 
infected or have otherwise compromised metabolic function 
are the first to develop symptoms. Most characteristically, 
pain and soreness. Infections flourish in this state of 
acid-hypoxia. Carbohydrate metabolism is disordered 
resulting in hypoglycemia with further symptom production. 

When the narcotic substance or non-narcotic stressors 
evoking endorphins produce the euphoric state and symptom 
relief state, there is a state of alkaline-hyperoxia. 
Exogenous narcotics and self-made narcotics (endorphins) 
are alkaloids which produce an alkaline state in which 
there can be a normal amount of oxygen for biological 
functions and normal oxidoreductase enzyme function 
processing the free radicals, peroxides, acids, alcohols 
and the aldehydes. Thus, there is a see-saw metabolic 
function including the relief phase followed by a 
disordered metabolic function during the withdrawal 
symptom phase of addiction. The higher than normal 
exogenous narcotics and endorphins creates its own 
problem in disordered judgement and an unnatural euphoria.

A person who misses a meal and has symptoms emerge is in 
trouble with food addiction. A person who eats food to 
relieve physical or mental symptoms is in trouble and is 
either already or will soon become a food addict. The simple 
fact is that a person eating foods to remove mental stress 
symptoms, no matter whether this is protein, carbohydrate or 
a mixture of these is in trouble. Eating to relieve symptoms 
is simply an incorrect method of managing symptoms or for  
that matter, weight reduction or optimum weight maintenance. 
The result of eating to relieve symptoms is mentally and 
physically deteriorating.

Section 5   	 	You Are What You Eat!

----------


Trite, overused expression? Not hardly! One of the most
common health problems in America today is poor digestion.
It seems that we all have a list of foods that give our
digestive system fits for several hours after we eat them.
So, what can we do to combate this problem? In a word:
ENZYMES.

Digestive enzymes can be an important supplement to aid our
digestion. They are a catalyst that will speed up the
chemical reactions of digestion, which saves the body a lot
of energy. Digestion uses a good deal of energy, which
explains why our bodies are sluggish after a large meal. 

There are literally hundreds of thousands of enzymes active
in every organ, tissue and fluid of your body, and each has
its own specific function. Enzymes digest our food and
convert it so that our muscles, nerves and glands are
fortified. Enzymes assist kidneys, lungs, liver, skin and
colon in their important eliminative tasks. Actually it
would be easier to list what they do not do, for they are
involved in every aspect of our lives. In other words,
enzymes move our muscles, stimulate our nerves, make our
heart beat, keep us breathing and even enable us to think.
We get enzymes from two sources, those made by our body and
those we ingest. Only raw or uncooked food contains enzymes.
Enzymes are heat sensitive, so when our food is cooked, most
of the enzymes are destroyed. The body itself is called upon
during digestion to take enzymes from the body to digest the
enzyme depleted food. This puts stress on our organs and
tissues which in turn can have serious consequences. 

Enzymes are one of the key substances in the body -- without
them we could not exist. Since our bodies are live enzyme
organisms, we need live enzyme foods that are properly
digested and properly assimilated. Enzymes are also
necessary for proper elimination. 

What creates enzyme deficiency? Digestion of food takes a
high priority and acts as a powerful stimulus in the demand
for enzymes. We add to that stress, pollution, strenuous
exercise, colds, fever, pregnancy, caffeine, and alcohol
which all contribute to enzyme depletion. The body may not
have its storehouse of enzymes replenished at the necessary
rate. When you eat food continually deficient in enzymes,
your digestive organs become exhausted. The body puts a
higher priority on digestion than on maintaining health, and
it will call on enzymes from other parts of the body to
finish the job, thereby depleting the immune system. Our
body can be weakened to such an extent that it can no longer
defend itself against disease. 

Dr. Edward Howell likened the enzymes in our body to a bank
account. Each of us is born with a limited number of enzymes
our body can produce in a lifetime, we can call this our
enzyme bank account. The enzyme bank account can get out of
balance - heavy withdrawals and skimpy deposits. Deposits
are made by eating enzyme rich raw foods and by
supplementing the diet with plant enzymes. Withdrawals are
made by eating cooked or processed foods, and by the number
of enzyme robbers we mentioned earlier. As our enzyme bank
account is depleted over the years, we begin to recognize
illness, ulcers, constipation, bloating, arthritis,
headaches, PMS, chronic fatigue, etc, etc.

Enzymes are present in raw food, which specifically aid in
their digestion. Bananas, avocados, papayas, mangos, and
pineapples are examples of fruits that are high in enzymes.
One of the best sources of enzymes is sprouts. Most enzymes
in food are destroyed by heat. Cooking food by steaming,
microwaving, and baking destroys most of the enzymes. Our
bodies also make some enzymes, but this process decreases as
we age. Steaks and pizzas require enzymes to digest but
contain no enzymes. When we eat these processed foods our
bodies start the process of making enzymes for digestion. If
we can't make enzymes fast enough or in sufficient
quantities, indigestion may result and stress is put on the
body. Sufficient vitamins and minerals in the diet are also
important in the production of enzymes.

There are over 1000 types of enzymes. The enzymes most often
found in supplements are: 1) lipase - to digest fats, 2)
protease - to digest proteins, 3) amylase - to digest
carbohydrates, and 4) lactase - to digest milk sugar or
lactose.

Enzyme supplements can help solve digestive problems. They
are readily available in health food stores but are even
showing up in more "mainline" retail stores like Walmart and
Walgreens. They can be taken approximately 30 minutes before
or 30 minutes after eating. The absolute best source for
qualtiy enzymes is in, as noted above, sprouted foods and
raw, organic fruits and vegetables.

We are indeed what we eat. Begin the healthy habit of
supplementing your diet with nature's catalyst and enjoy the
healthy benefits.

There is only one kind of food that contains enzymes, and that is raw 
food. We need protein, vitamins, and minerals for the production of 
enzymes, be they metabolic or digestive, and by eating foods that contain 
enzymes we can lower the demands on the body to produce them. 

The human digestive system works best when both meals and combinations of 
different foods are simple.
