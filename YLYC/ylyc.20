Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

I am a registered nurse and mother of two young 
children. At age 27, I was diagnosed as suffering 
with rheumatoid arthritis and have been on prescription 
medication ever since. I have had periods of relief, 
but never complete remission. After the birth of my 
second child, I suffered a particularly bad flare-up. 
There were times when I couldn't even turn on the tap.

Desperate for relief from the pain, I began taking an 
herb called Yucca. I had heard that it was helpful for 
arthritis. First I noticed that I didn't need as much 
of my medication so I started to gradually cut back. 
When my prescription had run out I never refilled it.

My Rheumatologist told me that I was probably in 
remission. This is the same specialist that had told 
me that I would be on medication for the rest of my 
life! 

It's now 13 months later and I am still symptom free!
Only time will tell if this will continue, but I 
belief it will!

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I wanted to share my story with your readers. I suffered 
a great deal from arthritis. There were times that I 
couldn't sleep, I just walked the floor with terrible pain 
in my hips, shoulders, wrists and my fingers. At times I 
thought the bones were pushing right through the skin. I 
tried different medications. They'd work for a while, and 
then I'd be right back to the same pain. On top of all this, 
I started getting numbness and pin in both my hands. I would 
often drop things and even would spill hot coffee on myself. 
I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and told that I 
have to have surgery. The surgery wasn't always successful 
either.

My son sent me to an herbologist before my surgery. He put 
me on White Oak and Yucca. It's now been 4 months, the pain 
is gone, I'm sleeping well at night, and I can do things I 
haven't been able to do in a long time. I even cancelled the 
surgery for Carpal Tunnel, at least for now until I see how 
things continue.

----------

	This is the third of a series of articles designed 
to be used as a resource or a starting ground in determining 
which alternative/complementary treatment will benefit 
you. Many of the commonly recognized modalities are briefly 
described here. Remember, this is a brief description. Often 
we will not be able to do justice to the therapy in question 
in such a limited amount of space. This resource is meant to 
educate you as to the numerous options available. YOU are the 
one who is empowered to take control over your health on a 
going forward basis. Remember, too, that the onus is upon the 
individual to ensure that the practitioner you choose is 
properly qualified and possesses the required certification 
for your area.

Iridology - The art and science of evaluating one's health 
by "reading the eyes". Simply by carefully observing special 
markings in the iris and surrounding areas of the eye, a 
competent reader can reveal the location of disease, its 
history and progression, even clues to the resolution.

Macrobiotics - Dr. George Oshawa broadened the system to 
include the entire individual. He treated illness with no 
medicines, only natural foods. A Macrobiotic diet is based 
on all foods falling into either the yin or yang category. 
More than just a diet but a total way of living, macrobiotics 
centers on becoming whole through a whole foods diet, and by 
following a holistic, healthy and balanced lifestyle. It is 
said that if foods are properly chosen and combined, a 
diseased body can find the proper balance and be restored. 
Because of the dramatic adjustment in both lifestyle and 
diet, you are advised to pay careful attention to how your 
body responds during this treatment.

Magnetic Therapy - Magnetic Therapy is works in conjunction 
with the body at its most basic level; cellular, tissue, 
organ, systemic. The theory is based on the belief that 
your body functions at peak efficiency when all of these 
levels maintain an alkaline state as well as a state of 
high oxygenation. Injury or illness produce an acid and 
low oxygen state. Proper exposure to negative pole magnets 
can restore the balance, thus healing the body. Magnetic 
therapy is used for many conditions such as: pain relief, 
arthritis, diabetes, cancer, sports injuries, increasing 
energy, reducing stress and alleviating insomnia.

Massage Therapy - There are many different kinds of massage, 
but each of them require touch using varying intensities of 
pressure. A number of things can be accomplished through 
massage; increasing circulation by dilating the blood 
vessels, eliminating wastes and toxic debris by stimulating 
lymph circulation, improving muscle tone by increasing the 
blood supply and nutrition to the muscles and tissues.

Meditation - Although there are various forms of meditation, 
Transcendental Meditation is the most commonly recognized. 
Practiced by millions, this is a simple, natural, and 
effortless technique. There have been many scientific 
studies done on the effectiveness of this technique. 
Transcendental Meditation is popular for a number of 
reasons. It requires no belief or lifestyle change. It 
is non-religious, not time-consuming, and can be learned 
by anyone regardless of age or level of education. This 
technique has been known to reduce anxiety, increase 
self-esteem, increase problem-solving ability, and 
enhance creativity.

Mitzvah Technique - There are many reasons why people 
pursue the Mitzvah Technique; postural problems, problems 
with neck, back and spine, auto accidents and other similar 
injuries, headaches and tension or stress. This technique 
was developed by M. Cohen-Nehemia. The principal is to 
re-educate postural body usage through gentle, persuasive, 
hands on methods. There are four basic areas of development 
in which this technique teaches you to independently maintain 
health postural habits. They are through physical changes, 
knowledge, awareness and application. The Mitzvah Technique 
is appropriate for all ages and has also shown to benefit 
body performance, circulation, co-ordination, concentration, 
breathing quality, voice and general health.

Naturopathy-- Naturopaths believe in the body's ability to 
heal itself. Naturopathic Medicine is a completely natural 
approach to health and healing that takes into consideration 
the whole person. There are six principals of healing that 
are the building blocks for Naturopathic Medicine; the 
healing power of nature, identify and treat the cause, 
first do no harm, treat the whole person, the physician 
as teacher, prevention. Each of these building blocks 
possess their own code of principals. Taking into account 
the patient's physical and mental health, genetic 
predispositions, and environmental influences, the 
Naturopathic Practitioner sets out to detect and eliminate 
the underlying causes of illness rather than merely 
suppressing the symptoms. The process of treatment could 
include a variety of therapies such as herbology, 
reflexology, massage, nutrition, etc.

Section 5   	What the cosmetic companies really offer you. 
				Part One

			By LaNita Wampold 
			mailto:LaNita@LaNita.com

 How It All Began...

After World War II, the production and use of synthetic 
cosmetics boomed. Today the use of "decorative" cosmetics 
has become the facial "uniform" of the modern, civilized 
woman. This has been created by the advertising operations 
of the commercial cosmetic giants. Even today  these products
continue to contain extremely harmful substances.

Toward the end of the 1960's there were signs of returning 
to a more  natural life style. Since that time, with the 
advances in awareness of the environment, there has been a 
more critical view of the substances used in synthetic 
cosmetics.

Let me first explain what I mean by synthetic cosmetics. 
After WW II, the use of synthetically derived ingredients 
became widespread because of the reduced cost of ingredients. 
These ingredients, for the most part were derived from 
petroleum which is considered a very inexpensive  resource. 

 What's Happening Today ?

Since the 1980's companies have emerged that offer products 
that contain both natural ingredients and synthetic 
preservatives, emulsifiers, dyes, foaming agents and 
fragrances. These products are best referred to as
"semi- natural" for they are not completely natural 
nor completely synthetic.

Many of the major cosmetic firms have made a practice of 
adding terms such as "natural" or "organic" to their products, 
yet these products are not totally either.  

In the field of synthetic, commercially produced cosmetics, 
new  substances are constantly being developed that claim 
to be non-irritating and to care for and heal the skin. 
These products actually contain effective synthetic 
substances which are not found naturally in such concentrates. 
Even though nature can now be quite convincingly imitated 
in the lab, the vital force that is the essence of organic, 
natural substances is missing.

All synthetic cosmetic products contain preservatives 
and/or disinfectants that impair or even eliminate 
the effectiveness of any natural substances they may 
contain. These ingredients are foreign substances 
(Imidazolidinyl & Diazolidinyl Urea(Germall II & Germall 
115), Propylnene Glycol, Sodium Laurel Sulfate) that are 
known to damage the skin's flora and protective "acid 
mantle". Moreover, they promote aging of the skin by 
reducing its water-absorbent capacities. As they penetrate 
the skin's layers, such ingredients remove the skin's. 
The wrinkles resulting  from this process are then 
likely to be treated with some anti-aging cream that is 
equally likely to contain harmful preservatives.    

"What About Other Product Lines"?   

Looking at the commercial production of shampoos is  
sobering, also. Shampoos are products that directly 
affect the  scalp. In the manufacture of shampoos, 
we find aggressive tensides and strong alkaline soaps 
that are not beneficial for  the skin. 

The industry likes adding sodium lauryl sulfates or  
sodium laureth sulfates, substances that foam and clean  
thoroughly. These ingredients clean so thoroughly that 
the protective acid mantel and the skin's natural sebum 
are completely washed away. Not only is the skin stripped 
of its  natural protection, but the above ingredients are 
known to cause eye irritations, skin rashes, hair loss, 
scalp scurf similar to dandruff, and allergic reactions. 
It is frequently disguised in semi-natural cosmetics
and shampoos as "comes from coconut".   

As a result, the scalp is off balance, and endangers the 
hair that grows from it. It has even been established in 
Germany that pain-relieving agents are added because the 
shampoos cause pain. Even though preservatives such as 
formaldehyde and nitrosamines are harmful to the skin, 
they are still permitted to be used as preservatives in 
the United States. Add to this picture, the addition of 
chemical thickeners, preservatives, dyes, and fragrances, 
which may penetrate the hair follicles and  enter the 
blood stream. One ingredient, dioxane, a substance that 
has been widely used in the manufacture of shampoos, is 
known to be carcinogenic.
