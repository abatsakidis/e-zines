1. How Many Ways Are There To Treat, Promote 
And Improve Human Health?

There are many methods to treat, promote, and improve 
human health, but if you look closely, it becomes very 
evident that there are only six basic ways. All of the 
other methods fall under one of the six basic categories. 
The basic categories include: exercise, nutrition/diet, 
medical/chemical/drugs, surgery, emotional/mental/mind 
body, biomechanical/structural. If you only use one of 
the six, you may be missing the boat back to health. Many 
health problems are multifaceted today and require more 
than one method to achieve optimum results. So, if your 
health care program falls short add other approaches to 
the program, it just might be what you have been missing. 
Also remember that nutrition is the basic foundation for 
building and maintaining a health body. What you eat today, 
walks and talks tomorrow! Diet and a targeted nutritional
supplementation/support program can be helpful in all health 
restoration programs. Most people do not get all the 
nutrients they require on a daily basis from their diet 
alone. Nutritional supplementation can help to fill the 
holes that develop in your body armor due to a poor diet.

2. What Can I Do To Prevent Hemorrhoids?

Try this simple formula and you may be able to say goodbye 
to hemorrhoids forever. First eat more high fiber foods - fresh
fruit, vegetables and whole grains .... drink plenty of good 
water and that doesn't mean tap water - at least six cups a day 
.... stay active, this will reduce pressure in the anal and 
rectal veins which is a result from being in one position too 
long. Regular exercise also helps to prevent constipation. 
Follow this formula and you will feel much better overall and 
your hemorrhoids should be markedly improved or gone forever. 
Good Luck.

2. How Can I Beat My Heartburn Problem 
Without Drugs?

That's easy, avoid foods that trigger it - alcohol, chocolate, 
peppermint and fat. Avoid caffeine in foods and over-the-
counter pain medication. Also avoid carbonated drinks. If 
you're over weight ... lose it .... if you smoke, stop. If the 
problem effects you mainly at night - raise the head of your 
bed on four to six-inch blocks, or use a wedge pillow to elevate 
the upper half of your body Never, never, never go to bed with 
a full stomach. Also check to see if you are digesting properly, 
sometime the acid in the stomach come from poorly digested 
food, not your own stomach acids.


4. How Can I Avoid Or Eliminate Jaw Pain?

To relieve jaw pain or TMJ pain as it is sometime referred 
to, give your jaw a rest during painful episodes. Eat soft 
foods, avoid extreme jaw movements like those involving gum 
chewing, wide yawning, eating thick sandwiches and singing 
loudly. Apply moist heat or ice packs - whichever feels better- 
to the chewing muscles along the side of the face. Also keep a 
detailed pain diary to help you identify triggers and avoid 
them. It will also help, when your mouth is closed, to keep 
your lips together, teeth apart, and tongue resting on the 
floor of the mouth.


 5. Why Should A Pregnant Women Take Folic 
Acid Supplementation?

Folic acid supplementation is worth consideration for all 
women of reproductive age. This B vitamin helps prevent 
brain and spinal column defects in newborns. To prevent such 
defects, women should begin taking 400 micrograms a day at 
least one month prior to conception ... and continue for at 
least three months afterward. If a women starts taking folic 
acid supplementation after learning she is pregnant, it may 
be too late for the nutrient's beneficial effects. So, if you 
are thinking about getting pregnant, start now, don't wait!!!!


6. I'm Taking Calcium For Osteoporosis, Do I Need 
Any Other Minerals?

Women taking calcium to ward of osteoporosis should be sure
to get enough magnesium too. The body aims to keep the two
minerals in balance. Without enough magnesium, calcium is
simply excreted. Fact, up to 70% of women are magnesium-
deficient. If you're already taking calcium supplements, ask 
your health professional or nutritional consultant about adding 
a magnesium supplement or at least about eating more 
magnesium-rich foods like green leafy vegetables, whole-grain 
breads, cereals, soybeans, tofu, or yogurt. Better yet use a 
microcrystalline hydroxyapatite concentrate supplement, this 
type of supplement contains all the nutrients required for 
healthy bones.
