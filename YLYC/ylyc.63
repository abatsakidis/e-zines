Letter From the Editor

The minds ability to influence the body has been the cause for
intrigue over the past 3 decades. There has been a growing
tendency to explore this process throughout the scientific
community. The mind and body are fundamentally connected;
therefore, any treatment or therapy will impact both. The
placebo effect is a common example of this interaction. Although
highly recognized by the scientific community,  the placebo
response is under utilized as a resource in most medical
practices.

Studies have been done on these therapies and the results
suggest they are all viable options to be considered for many
health issues. Mind/body therapies are particularly beneficial
in that they empower the patient, providing a feeling of control
over their health and their lives. Specific mind/body treatments
include:

Psychotherapy can reduce the recovery process from surgery,
and can be of tremendous benefit with illnesses that appear to
have no medical cause.

Support Groups have a powerful, positive influence on most
illnesses. Patients suffering from fatal diseases often
significantly increase their survival time by participating in a
support group.

Meditation has long been accepted as a solution to stress issues
and lowering blood pressure. There are now indicators that
regular meditation can positively affect many health issues;
chronic pain, cholesterol, and longevity to name a few.

Imagery has been proven successful in controlling pain. It is
commonly used in conjunction with cancer treatments; a method
of easing nausea caused by chemotherapy, and a tool to enhance
the immune system. Used with other treatments, Music Therapy
has also proven effective as a pain reliever in particular with burn
patients, brain injury and cancer patients.

Hypnosis is most commonly used for addictions, pain control, and
phobias; although also helpful with other ailments such as allergies
and asthma.

Still other mind/body therapies include Yoga, Biofeedback, Dance
Therapy, Art Therapy, and Prayer and Mental Healing. Each of
these have their own strengths and benefit specific health issues.

More work is needed, but there is a growing amount of evidence
that many of the mind-body therapies discussed here, if
appropriately selected and wisely applied, can be clinically as
well as economically cost-effective, that they work, and that
they are safe.

Until next time... the best of health to you,

Section 1       MIND OVER MATTER:
Visualization and How Personal Beliefs Can Limit or Heal
                         Part 1

                 by Laurel Duran, CMT
            http://www2.amigo.net/bluecord

Most of us have heard or made statements about our body's
condition that  reflect a belief that the condition is incapable
of changing. Statements  such as "High blood pressure runs in
your family so you're stuck with it",  or "You know how it is
when you break a bone: it's never the same again",  or "I get a
really bad cold every winter without fail" can literally work
like a computer program in our psyche, needlessly setting the
mind  on accepting physical limitations as unalterable facts. As
patients, most of us have been offered limiting thoughts by
health care professionals who are unaware of the potentially
destructive power  that those limiting thoughts can have on our
actual condition. Many  of us have made self-limiting statements
that begin with the words  "My doctor said ..." such as "My
doctor said I'm stuck with this  incurable condition for the
rest of my life and there's nothing I can do about it." or "My
doctor said that this condition is hereditary and it was
inevitable that I would end up with it", or "My doctor said my
only choice if I want to stay alive is to have this surgically
removed."

Beliefs that the physical body is incapable of change reveal
that the  believer is operating under the false perception that
the physical body has a mind of its own, and that mind is
separate and beyond the control of the person himself. Modern
research into the body-mind connection shows us that "Mind Over
Matter" is a proven fact that means the thoughts you hold in
your mind will materialize into physical reality. Research in
quantum physics has shown that matter, when viewed at the
sub-atomic level, is not solid, dense and unchanging at all. To
the contrary, it is constantly moving and is actually made up
largely of EMPTY SPACE which can be translated as "having
unlimited potential". It has further been discovered that the
cellular movement and constantly changing formations that matter
takes are altered by the fact that it is being observed. If
someone is observing  a collection of cells through a sub-atomic
lens, they can literally  ALTER the appearance, shape and
visible formation of that  collection of cells just by observing
it. If the observer thinks "These  cells are next going to move
into this shape in that direction",  that is exactly what those
cells do. It is as if the cell of the  physical body reply with
"Okay boss, whatever you say. That's how  it will be." ( If
medical science one day decides to capitalize on this research
finding, we may be healing ourselves by watching our own
cellular growth through a sub-atomic camera lens inserted into
our  body while we issue commands for a more positive direction
of celluar growth. In the meantime, we can use our powerful
brains and hearts to picture healing!)  I know "Mind Over
Matter" to be true from personal experience.  When I broke my
neck and was completely paralyzed in a car wreck  in 1986, I
heard "You'll never walk again" and "Science says that
quadriplegia is permanent.

You're in denial and the sooner you accept the truth, the better
off  you'll be." But I knew better! After having a near-death
experience visit to heaven, I just KNEW that the Creator could
heal anything -- even my quadriplegia -- if I would just keep
having faith that it was possible. I told many friends, family
members and health care professionals to keep quiet if they
themselves lacked faith and had nothing positive to picture for
me.

Part 2 and conclusion of this article will appear in nex month's
issue.

Section 2       Tea Tips - Tea Helps the Heart

In a recent study, a research team at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston has found the heart-attack risk in people
drinking one or more cups of tea per day was about half that of
those who drank no tea.

The team's findings "suggest that tea may be beneficial because
it contains flavonoids which reduce platelet aggregation and
inhibit LDL-cholesterol oxidation," according to Peter Wehrwein,
in his article "More evidence that tea is good for the heart,"
in The Lancet.

"All teas are not equal," Mr. Wehrwein reports. "Last year (Gary
Beecher of the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural
Research Service) reported on catechin (flavan-3-ol)
concentrations in different forms of tea. Although several
brands of black tea had substantial amounts of catechins, there
were reduced amounts in decaffeinated black tea, and catechins
were undetectable in herbal teas."

Section 3               Top Dog - Bruised Paws

How often does your dog seem to be walking gently on tippy toes
rather than confidently all four paws? Think of the number of
times that your own feet hurt, and you have shoes to protect
them. There are any number of reasons that your dog may have
bruised or sore paws.

Arnica Ointment has long been a popular remedy in Germany and
Austria, especially for bruises and sprains. It is an aromatic,
bitter, astringent herb that stimulates the immune system and
relieves pain and inflammation.

Great for bumps and bruises, just rub the Arnica ointment on the
area. It's much healthier for stiffness and swelling than a shot
of cortisone.

Paws for thought: Arnica is a very powerful herb, use it up to
four times a day, but not for longer than a week at a time.
Arnica treats the cause of the pain (swelling and inflammation)
not suppressing the pain like many drugs do.

Dosage Use for emergency only 2 to 3 times daily for two days
then switch to Echinacea Calendula ointment. Arnica is excellent
in emergency situations (first aid). If dermatitis occurs
discontinue immediately. Echinacea Calendula ointment can be
safely used after arnica ointment when prolonged treatment of a
problem is required. Do not put Arnica ointment on open cuts or
sores.  Please see the dosage chart by clicking on the link
below. -----  Do you have a specific question about your pet's

Section 4       Mood and Memory Wellness:
         How to be Spirited and Sharp for 100 Years!
                         Part 3

                 By Dr. John H. Maher

Recommended Lifestyle and Supplement Protocol for Mild
Depression

As always make sure you have the basics covered. Good dietary
habits, regular exercise, rejuvenating sleep, with alcohol,
caffeine and tobacco avoided or in moderation at least. Taking a
very complete six-a-day multivitamin/mineral is essential. Men
over 40 should consider adding to the above human growth hormone
(hgh) secretagogues and testosterone precursors, as these
hormones tend to restore a more youthful, confident and
optimistic state of mind. Women over 40 may want to enhance
natural progesterone (not synthetic progestins), especially if
their symptoms are pre-menstrual. Progesterone is a natural
anti-depressant. Women at or past the 'change of life' should
consider hgh and natural triple estrogen plus progesterone
replacement therapy. Estrogen is thought to be very protective
of the mind, so unless there is strong breast cancer concern or
risk, or other estrogen contra-indication such as liver/gall
bladder disease, phlebitis, cervical pre-cancerous lesions etc.,
natural HRT (hormone replacement therapy) should be strongly
considered.

The other basic is deep sleep. Exercise, avoiding caffeine after
noon, dark rooms, white noise, cool bedrooms and hot baths are
all helpful. The herbs valerian, passion flower and kava kava,
hops and minerals calcium and magnesium are indicated for adults
of any age. It may take two weeks for the effects to be noticed
by some. Melatonin is more indicated the more above 40 you are.
Also, night workers, those travelling across time zones, and
women with hot flashes often do well with melatonin. Salivary
'Sleep Profile' melatonin tests are now readily available. 5-HTP
is the other great natural sleep inducer. It is also an
antidepressant, anti-anxiolytic and tends to curb carbohydrate
and chocolate craves. Therefore, if your depression is strongly
related to poor and difficult sleep, 5-HTP is to be strongly
considered. 5-HTP is presented more fully below.

Please keep in mind that many common prescription medications
cause tiredness, loss of libido and flattening of emotions. So
always consult your doctor.

Now if you have been following the above recommendations for
several months and still feel in low spirits, then
supplementation specific for mood elevation is likely indicated.

How To Start Your Mood Wellness Program

The following nutritional and herbal supplements have proved
very useful for easing and preventing mild-to-moderate
depression. Some of these supplements aid in the production of
neurotransmitters (low levels of these chemicals in the brain
have been linked to depression). Other supplements have a
soothing effect on nerves. Others protect the brain from the
damage of stress.

Most people struggling with depression, even those on
prescription anti-depressants, can benefit from the nutrients
listed here. Such supplements as Gingko Biloba, St John's Wort
and 5-HTP can be added to a high quality
mega-multi-vitamin/mineral, but should not be used without your
doctor's consent if you are presently taking an antidepressant
medication. Most importantly, never stop taking an
antidepressant or any other prescription drug without first
talking to your doctor.

If indicated, consider the following supplements to support your
mood. However, severe depression, or moderate depression that is
worsening rapidly, demands immediate professional attention.

Before starting, be aware that certain cautions are associated
with taking individual supplements, especially if you have other
medical conditions and/or you're taking medications. Always
advise your health care provider about all your supplemental
choices.

Finding exactly the right combination of supplements, one that
works best for you, may take some time and a bit of trial and
error. And your choices may well be determined by time and
money. It will be worth the trouble, however, if you can avoid
taking more potent prescription medications.
