Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

	I recently had an accident, where I fell 
and sustained a rather serious head injury. After 
my head healed, the problem went down my spine to 
the shoulders and back. 	

	After trying varies forms of medicine and 
treatments, it was recommended to me that I try 
acupunture therapy. It helped, but as an added 
measurement, because of the serverity of my injuries, 
my acupunturist also applied magnetic therapy. He 
circled my back with 2 bullet shaped magnets, 
without actual contact. I was amazed that the 
results were so benificial to my condition. It 
didn't take long to see results. Only a couple of 
weeks of treatment. I would recommend this to anyone!

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I've been constipated all of my life. I was, a once a week 
kind of girl. When I went to see my doctor about it, he 
said that was regular for me and not to worry about it. 
As a result of this irregularity I had hemorrhoids, bad 
breath, sore back and legs and headaches. I started taking 
Cascara Sagrada and it helped some. Then I added a good 
Fibre supplement, but I stopped and started again about 
3 times. Each time that I started, I got constipated again. 
So I stopped. It wasn't until the third time of trying and 
getting results did I understand why. The Fibre supplement 
I take has several herbs included. Some of them will rid 
the body of parasites. When parasites are weakened, they 
ball up in the middle of your colon and of course plug you 
up. I found this out at a health seminar I went to. I am 
now regular and much more fun to be around.

Section 5	Managing Weight in a Hectic Schedule

Joan Smith is climbing the ladder of success. A graduate 
of Colgate University with a Masters degree in marketing, 
Smith works for a successful corporation. After countless 
promotions, she was recently appointed Vice President and 
General Manager of her division.

In addition to her many professional accomplishments, she 
is a wife and mother of two boys.

It sounds as though Smith has the perfect life, one that 
many might envy. Unfortunately, she has a weight problem. 
She is 45, attractive, and 50 pounds overweight. She 
worries about her weight constantly, feeling frustrated 
that a person so seemingly powerful and in control could
appear so out of control.

She is often angry with herself for not being able to 
overcome her problem. She is beginning to see herself 
as a failure in an area that is hard to hide, especially 
as her weight problem grows.

Smith tends to feel lost and forgotten because there is 
never enough time to meet her needs. So, during the day 
she attempts to fill those needs with the most available 
commodity in our society- FOOD! Food takes on a 
disproportionate meaning for it becomes an instant means 
of gratification, companionship or rebellion.

Smith of course, tried every diet on the market, frequently 
losing 10 pounds only to regain 20. Her shame and confusion 
increased with each failure. But diets do not address the 
real problem. The "one-size-fits-all" mentality of dieting, 
with its messages of deprivation, obsession with food and 
scales, will never work.

To solve her problem, Smith must find a weight loss program 
that addresses the true cause of her problem, not just the 
symptoms of those
excess pounds. With an appropriate weight management program, 
she will be able to free herself from the lose and gain 
cycle, and learn how to create a lifestyle that will make 
thinner a reality, in a positive and healthy way.

Section 6   	   	Aromatherapy for Pets

			by Jan Blacktopp, R.M.T.

	page; http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html

----------

Those of you who live with a dog or a cat will know just 
how much fun and pleasure these pets bring into our lives.  
Not only are they emotionally satisfying but physically 
they are a blessing to us, as it has been demonstrated 
that stroking of a pet can lower both stress and blood 
pressure levels.

Besides the improved good health of your pets, there can 
be additional advantages to be gained by using essential 
oils for their care.

Pets can suffer from ailments in the same way as humans.  
Some of the next treatments will ensure their happiness 
and comfort. If problems such as abscesses, coughs, and 
cuts do not improve after several days, veterinary advice 
will be necessary.


DOGS

Dogs have a much stronger sense of smell than humans, so 
generally aim to use a minimum quantity and increase if 
and when necessary. Essential oils discourage the fleas, 
ticks and other minute parasites dogs bring home sometimes.  
If you shampoo your dog, you may add 1 drop of either 
lemongrass or citronella oil to his shampoo. If your dog 
is cut or grazed, bathe the area in a water solution of 
thyme or lavender oil. Use 6 drops of either oil to a 
cereal bowl of water. The essential oils will help clean 
the wound as they are natural antibiotics and disinfectants, 
and you can rest assured that if the dog licks the wound 
afterwards he wont be taking in any unnatural substances.  
Dogs suffer from coughs, colds and the flu, just as we do, 
and the best essential oils are tea tree and eucalyptus.  
Add 2 drops of both of these oils to 30ml of vegetable oil
and rub apply this to your dogs chest, rib cage, and 
throat and from the ears to the shoulders. You should also 
treat the area where the dog sleeps. Add 3 drops of each 
oil to wash water when washing blankets. Dogs also suffer 
from arthritis.  Here is a recipe to help ease the pain 
of sore joints.  

Rosemary 4 drops 
Lavender 2 drops  
Ginger 3 drops 
	added to 30ml of vegetable oil. Rub this all over 
your dogs sore body avoiding the eyes. Even if he licks 
it off some of the essential oils will have already been 
absorbed and will be fast at work easing the pain.


CATS

Treat arthritis and fleas in cats in the same way as 
described for dogs. Cats suffer from coughs and 
bronchitis and these can be treated in much the same 
way as you would humans, massaging along the back and 
on the chest with 2-4 drops of eucalyptus oil once a 
day until it clears.  For ear problems into 1 teaspoon 
of warm olive oil, add 1 drop of tea tree oil, 1 drop 
of lavender oil & 1 drop of chamomile. Drip the formulated 
oil into the ear as well as massaging around the ear. For 
skin problems in 30 ml of vegetable oil add 10ml of evening 
primrose oil, 5 drops of lavender oil and 5 drops of 
chamomile oil. Apply this to the affected areas. These two 
last formulas can be used for dogs as well as other animals.  
Remember that the smaller the size of the animal the smaller 
the quantity you use of essential oil.
