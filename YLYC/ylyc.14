Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

I was tested positive for HIV on 1983, I live well for 
many years, with some complications, but I must share 
with all of you that Now, my life is so great, I never 
felt this way before, I know that is thanks to the 
amount of vitamins and herbs that I take daily. The magic 
formula; start with ST.John's Wort- Echinacea- Ginko Biloba 
- Saw Palmento - 6.000mg a day of vitamin C- 1200mg a day 
of vitamin E- L-glutamine-Folic Acid- Complex B50 2 times a 
day- High doses of Garlic Pills- Cod liver Oil- Avena Sativa 
Wild Oats-Magnesium- and Zinc. Besides all my Cocktails 
pills as is Crixivan-Zerit-and Epivir. Well you must think
this is too much, but I have a way of doing during meals, 
and on empty stomac. I quit Alcohol almost 3 years ago, my 
liver is almost normal in level, I do not smoke, I drink
lots of water, and I get at least 7 hrs. of good sleep. 
After having a dangerous neumonia 4 years ago, my lungs are 
fine, I do not get sick or diarrea, or fever, I felt very
energetic, and full of life. If you are suffering from HIV 
and want to chat with me, e- mail me I will love to share 
with you more details of how I consume all this 
(mailto:yourlife@life-choices.com with "HIV Support Address" 
in the subject heading to receive the email address. Of course 
you must consult with your doctor, NOT every case of HIV is 
the same. I just wanted to tell you all that I am happy, 
heathy, and I do believe in HERBS as well as VITAMINS. My
appetite is great, and I am not overweight, or skinny, my 
wait is 160 lb. and stay that way for long time. I am ready 
and waiting for a cure for Aids. My cell count is very low, 
but is getting better with the cocktails. My Doctor is very 
happy, and surprised that I am not dead.

Section 3    Clinical Research Uncovers Missing Links in 
			Resolving Chronic Pain  

			by Gerald H. Smith, D.D.S.   
			Langhorne, PA o USA


The song, "The head bone is connected to the neck bone; the 
neck bone is connected the shoulder bone" and so on reveals 
functional anatomic relationships that led this researcher 
to search for the functional links between the dental 
complex (teeth, jaw position) and the craniosacral system 
(skull and spine and  its relation to chronic headaches, neck,
facial and low back pain.

The one big common denominator that exists between chronic 
pain and the human frame is a lack of parallel relationships 
among body parts. The main parallel planes that are involved 
include the ear, eye, shoulder, and pelvic planes. A key 
contributing factor within the entire system is a distorted  
upper jaw or maxillae which literally represents the foundation
of the human skull. When this foundation is crooked so goes 
the rest of the body.

The architectural design of the human body has structural 
balance as its basic theme. When parallelism is lost, 
imbalances  result with potential debilitating symptoms 
that can occur in various parts of the body. From a clinical 
perspective  patients who do not respond to traditional 
therapy for chronic complaints of headaches, cervical pain, 
low back pain and leg pain frequently have a faulty alignment 
of their upper jaw. This misalignment causes tension within 
the covering of the brain and spinal cord (dual membrane 
system) which triggers off the pain receptors.

Patients with premature loss of molar teeth with tilting of 
adjacent teeth, narrowed jaws, deep bites, worn down 
partials or full dentures offer prime examples of jaw 
misalignments. The jaw misalignment generates a mechanical
problem every time the patient chews or when their teeth, 
partial or full dentures contact during normal swallowing.
The upper and lower jaws must work together with the muscles 
of the mouth, head and neck. If the upper jaw plane is not 
parallel, the muscles will not work as efficiently. Often 
the first signs of this imbalance are sore teeth or sore 
spots under partial or full dentures that will not go away 
and tightness of the low back, upper neck, shoulders and 
facial muscles.

As the imbalance persists, micro-traumas occur to the soft 
tissues, nerves and tiny blood vessels surrounding the teeth 
or in the gums and can result in muscle spasms. It is these 
muscle spasms that trigger off the chain reaction causing 
the spine, shoulders, pelvis and legs to be out of alignment.

The domino affect of these chronic imbalances cause 
additional tension on other muscles, nerves and blood 
vessels. The pains that develop often do not respond to 
steroid injections, pain and anti-inflammatory medications,
physical therapy, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulations. 
This researcher has found that only when the structural 
imbalance has been corrected can the symptom of pain be 
resolved.

Several case histories are provided to support the validity 
of this concept:

Case 1. Twenty Year  Migraines and Low back Pain

J.G. is a 68 year-old female who has suffered severe migraine 
headaches and lower back pain for 20 years. This patient 
received a multitude of therapies over the twenty-year period 
that included various medications, manipulation and physical 
therapy. Unfortunately these approaches only provided temporary 
relief at best. The patient's underlying problem was an old 
set of dentures that were severely worn down in a distorted 
horizontal plane. The structural imbalances set up by the 
misaligned denture was the direct cause for the upper neck 
muscle spasms that entrapped the nerves and blood vessels to 
her head. Within several weeks after new full dentures were 
inserted that corrected the misaligned horizontal and vertical 
planes, the patient's migraines and low back pain disappeared.

Case 2. Ten Year Facial, Neck, Shoulder, Lower Back Pain and 
Leg Weakness.  

A.C. is a 46 year-old female patient who was referred from 
Ottawa Canada by her orthodontist. This patient had suffered 
left side pain from the top of her head to her toes. Ten years 
of traditional therapy by medical and dental practitioners did 
not produce any lasting relief.

The patient was presently undergoing orthodontic treatment 
for a poor bite and was wearing an upper and lower removable 
appliances. The upper dental appliance and  model of the 
patient's mouth were mounted on  special instrument to 
analyze the parallel planes. The upper appliance was
corrected by grinding down the  plastic material to 
establish a horizontal plane. Within five minutes after 
inserting the corrected appliance, 90% of the patient's left 
sided pain pattern disappeared. Additional nutritional and 
manipulative treatment  was provided during the next several 
days and increased the relief to a 98% level which the 
patient has maintained for the past three years.

Case 3.  Four Years of Incapacitating Facial Pain

Mrs. B.G., a 44 year-old female, suffered severe 
incapacitating facial pain for a four-year period. Mrs. G. 
was a registered nurse in Pittsburgh, PA. She had become 
gradually affected by facial pain to a point where she had
to stop working. The pain affected not only the left side 
of her face but caused her left eye to completely close. 
The patient was treated by numerous medical doctors 
including a complete evaluation at a prestigious pain 
clinic. As a last resort the patient was put on the new 
miracle drug Immitrex, for migraine headaches. At $40 per 
injection, this treatment brought only partial relief. An 
evaluation of the patient's problem revealed that her pain 
was caused by nerve entrapment from a spastic muscle. The 
patient's 15 year-old ill-fitting upper denture wore down 
to a point which reduced vertical support for the main 
chewing muscles. The resulting spasm put pressure on a
branch of the trigeminal or 5th cranial nerve  causing 
facial pain and closure of her left eye. Resolving the 
muscle spasm and correcting the denture brought permanent 
relief.

Resolving chronic pain involves an in depth analysis of the 
potential underlying sources. To better understand the 
causative factors the patient must be evaluated in five 
major areas: Skull, Dental Complex, Pelvic Complex, 
Physiological (nutritional deficiencies, heavy metal 
toxicity, poor digestion, acupuncture meridian imbalances, 
geopathic stress, acid-alkaline imbalance, environmental 
sensitivities) Complex and Psychological Complex. Since the 
body is totally integrated within these five systems it is 
extremely important to know which areas represent the major 
distortion and which represent the compensatory changes. 
Most often treating the patient's symptom is equivalent to 
constantly changing the front tires on a car that has a 
front end misalignment. Until physicians learn to diagnose 
the major underlying problems and make corrections with
appropriate therapies, health care will continue to be 
non-existent.

The neuro-anatomy of the head and neck region is extremely 
complex and closely related to one's jaw position. Dentists 
trained in this specialized field and utilizing state of the 
art technology can now offer a non-invasive approach to 
resolving the age old problem of pain.

Section 5   		Colloidal Silver - Part One

As different strains of bacteria become increasingly resistant
to antibiotics there has been a renewed interest in using 
silver as an antibiotic.
 
Silver has been reported to disinfect hundreds of different 
germs. Unlike conventional antibiotics, bacteria is unable to 
build resistance to the action of silver. 

Another great advantage of a properly prepared colloid of 
silver is that it is extremely safe to use, even with children. 
It is without the many side effects of conventional antibiotics. 

What is a Colloid ?

Colloids consist of very tiny particles suspended in a liquid, 
usually water. (Colloids may also be suspended in solids and 
in gases). Colloids differ from suspensions in that colloids do 
not settle.  The particles in a colloid are typically  0.01 to 
0.001 of a micron in diameter, or about four hundred thousandths 
to four millionths of an inch in diameter.
 
The Russian Scientist S.S. Voyutsky, wrote that a colloid system 
must have the following three characteristics;

1. It must be heterogeneous. (consisting of dissimilar ingredients 
	like silver and water)

2. The system must be multiphasic. (having more than one phase, 
	i.e.- solid/liquid, gas/liquid)

3. The particles must be insoluble. (does not dissolve in the 
	solution or suspension)

It is these three characteristics that give colloids their 
unique qualities. Colloids will remain heterogeneous, 
multiphasic, and insoluble as long as the particles are of 
colloid size. 

Current Status of Colloidal Silver.

In the U.S.A.,  Colloidal Silver is considered by the Food and 
Drug Administration to be a pre 1938 drug. Colloidal Silver 
products may be marketed as long as they are advertised and 
labeled for the same use as in 1938 and as long as they are 
manufactured in the original manner. The current status of 
Colloidal Silver is that it can be manufactured and distributed, 
but no claims regarding effectiveness against disease can be 
made without going through the (complicated and expensive) drug 
approval process. It may be alright to say that Colloidal Silver 
has antibacterial properties, but it is another to say it will
"cure"  bronchitis. 

Methods of Production.

Prior to 1938 there were a wide range of methods used to 
manufacture Colloidal Silver. These manufacturing approaches 
fall into five main groups. 

1.  Grind
2.  Wave
3.  Liquid
4.  Chemical
5.  Electrical

Of these five manufacturing processes, the grind process 
and the electro-colloidal process were primarily used to 
manufacture colloidal silver. Today, the FDA still allows 
both manufacturing techniques to be used. Of these two 
methods the electro-colloidal process is generally considered 
to be far superior. With the grind method the particles of 
silver are usually no finer than four one-thousandths of an 
inch. They may or may not be electrically charged. The size 
of the silver particle is so large compared to the possible 
charge, that the repelling forces would not be strong enough 
to offset the pull of gravity on the particles, which will 
tend to settle to the bottom of the solution, producing a 
less effective product. To offset this settling problem, 
some manufacturers add a "stabilizer" (usually a protein) 
to make the solution more viscous and keep them suspended 
for a longer period of time. The silver particles will still 
eventually settle to the bottom and the bottle will have to 
be shaken to re-disperse the particles of silver. The 
addition of stabilizers tend to block the beneficial effects 
of the silver particles. 

When the proper electrical process is used to make Colloidal 
Silver, and the particles are within the range of four one-
hundred-thousandths to four one-millionths of an inch in 
diameter, and are uniformly charged, a stabilizer is not 
required to keep the particles suspended. The repelling 
magnetic force will offset the pull of gravity on the 
particles, which are animated by  "Brownian Movement",  
and remain in suspension in a liquid medium almost 
indefinitely. The stability will depend on the size of 
the particles, the medium used, and the manufacturing 
process employed.
