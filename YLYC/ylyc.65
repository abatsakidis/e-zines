Letter From the Editor

We wake up in darkness and it’s dark again by supper time. No
wonder so many people get depressed and stay moody all winter
long. Between 5-10% of the population are affected by SAD
(Seasonal Affective Disorder), often referred to as “Winter
Blues”. That doesn’t sound like much but it equates to 10 to 25
million U.S. citizens alone!

This is a serious condition that is taken all too lightly by
most people... even by many victims. SAD is believed to be a
result of shifted circadian rhythms. In the winter we don't
receive the same strong light signal that is present in the
summer. As a result the internal ‘body clock' is out of whack
for many people, producing the wrong hormones at the wrong time
of day. Some scientists think that reduced levels of sunlight
may increase the level of melatonin in your brain. Melatonin is
a mood-controlling hormone your brain produces during darkness.

Symptoms will vary from one individual to another and depending
on the severity of the disorder. Characteristically, people will
experience severe moodiness and/or irritability. They have a
general lack of interest in anything, suffer from anxiety,
weight gain, daytime drowsiness, diminished concentration, and
require significantly more sleep. There are often reports of
sleep problems, a general lack of energy, and a craving for
carbohydrates.

Several highly credible sources, including the National
Institute of Mental Health, the Archives of General Psychiatry,
and JAMA (the Journal of the American Medical Association)
acknowledge the benefits of Light Therapy. There are several
types available radiating between 2,500 and 10,000 lux. Light
intensity is measured in "lux" units. To put this intensity into
perspective, the average home typically illuminates at 250 lux,
whereas on a summer day around noon the sun illuminates about
120,000 lux. The exposure time required can range anywhere from
15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the severity of the condition
and the strength of the lights. There are even Dawn Simulators
for mild SAD cases. These are programmable alarm clocks that
will gradually fill the room with a warm sunny glow, emulating a
morning dawn so naturally and precisely that your eyes will
react to it as if the sun had actually risen.

Most people see significant positive results within the first
week of Light Therapy. Some people see stronger benefits from
evening treatments rather than early morning ones. Ask your
local health care practitioner to help you determine the best
treatment for you.

"The FDA considers light boxes to be Class III medical devices.
Such devices may not be commercially distributed without
premarket approval or an Investigational Device Exception, a
measure that restricts medical claims made in advertising."
(Quote from JAMA report)

There’s only a couple of important things to remember when
considering a Light Therapy lightbox. The intensity of the
light, (you’ll likely want 10,000 lux)  and the distance at
which it produces that intensity. You’ll want the distance to be
comfortable to you, for example; some lightboxes only produce
10,000 lux if the box is 8 inches from your face. You will
likely enjoy the experience more at a distance of 23 inches, so
find one that produces 10,000 lux from a more appropriate
distance so you can maintain efficacy. Also, be sure that your
lightbox DOES NOT produce UV light. This is often found in
full-spectrum light and can be harmful to the eyes after
prolonged exposure. A terrific Website to offer information on
how to buy light boxes is Circadian Solutions,
http://www.circadiansolutions.com/ .

Remember that SAD can affect ANYONE! Although it most often
affects women, men, children and adolescents can also become
victims. In fact, according to Dr. Norman Rosenthal, an
environmental psychiatrist with the National Institute of Mental
Health and one of the leading experts in this field, estimates
that about 1 million children are affected by SAD.

Although traditional western medicine recognizes and
acknowledges the benefits of Light Therapy as a viable treatment
for SAD, they may also suggest anti-depressant medications. If
you think you or someone you know may suffer from SAD, check
with your local health care provider, do a LOT of research on
your own, and let a whole lot of light shine in!

Until next time... the best of health to you,

Section 1       MIND OVER MATTER:
Visualization and How Personal Beliefs Can Limit or 
Heal                                Part 2
                 by Laurel Duran, CMT
                http://www2.amigo.net/bluecord

While I knew that U.S. medical schools did not teach their
students about the healing power of positive thinking and
feeling, I needed  to heal quickly and could not wait until I
met doctors trained in positive  visualization. I chose to take
charge of "Mind Over Matter" by mentally  throwing out their
limiting beliefs about my condition like so much toxic  psychic
garbage. Then I used my own mind as a lens to picture positive
change at the cellular level of my spinal cord. I asked everyone
who cared  about me to join positive healing thoughts with me.
As our minds united  with the Creator on behalf of my healing,
we DID crumble the mountain of  disbelief and made room for the
healing miracle to come into my life. And  less than a year
after the car wreck I was running 3 miles daily!

"Mind Over Matter" was a major contributor to my wonderful
healing  process. Another word for this positive thought
extension is "prayer".  When one person extends positive loving
thoughts toward another, they are  actually praying for them,
stating to the universe and to the Creator what  they want to be
true.

It’s also true that limiting thoughts can work just as
powerfully. If one  person projects a negative thought-form
toward another, such as "She is  permanently damaged and she'll
never change", it's as if they are adding  energy to the
negative condition which can potentially hold the condition  in
place. I believe that it's better to simply notice when someone
is  TEMPORARILY in a troubled condition, and to answer it by
visualizing and  creating thoughts about the person’s healing,
whether the trouble is  physical, mental, emotional or
spiritual. I believe that the ultimate  power to heal always
rests in the patient's own mind united with the  Creator, and
that our loving thoughts and prayers ARE heard!

Some people have asked "I am very ill and I sometimes think I'll
never  get better. I can't help thinking that way at times. What
can I do about  such mental discouragement?" I have respect and
compassion for our normal  human suffering. The anguish that can
arise from a debilitating illness or  injury is both mental and
emotional rather than strictly mental. In order  to heal I
believe we FIRST need to literally feel the negative emotions
(sorrow, worry, anger, disappointment, fear, etc) safely and
privately  through emotional release in order to discharge their
burdensome energy out  of our system. Such emotional release is
a temporary phase of self-healing  that is very necessary.

When I cried during my paralysis, I imagined that  my worry,
fear and sorrows were going up to the Creator Who was just
waiting for me to unburden myself. My negative emotions were
thus emptied  out of my body through crying, and were placed
safely in the hands of the  One who can heal all. Often I needed
to sleep after such an emotional  release. Then when I awakened,
I was more receptive to the SECOND part of  my healing: positive
thinking. It was as if the emptying of negative  emotions
through crying had left a clean and beautifully empty space
inside  me, where hope, faith and positive healing thoughts
could make themselves  at home. "The open hands of Love are
always filled". No matter what  difficulties we encounter in our
lives, there is always healing potential  if we are willing to
fill in our empty spaces with love. It works!

Section 2       Top Dog - Pregnant Pets

You love your pets and want only the best for them. You’ve gone
to the time, the trouble, and the expense of investigating
natural remedies for them because you want them to be healthy.

Your pet is not so different from us humans. When your female
pet is pregnant she is in a very delicate state. Great care must
be taken in determining which herbal extracts to give your
little mamma. Just as there are many herbal combinations that
pregnant women should stay away from, there are many that could
also be harmful to your little petlings.

Be sure to refrain from using the following extracts with your
pregnant pet: ATR has anti-inflammatory properties  BCL has
properties that may be purgative or laxative in nature Kidney
Plus has a diuretic effect   Lax-Ex is a mild laxative  Cough-Ex
is an expectorant and demulcent  St. John`s Wort stimulates
menstruation and has anti-inflammatory properties.

Rule of Thumb: Do not give your pregnant pet anything that
contains anti-inflammatory, diuretic, or purgative properties,
or acts as a laxative regards of how mild.

Section 3       Tea Tips- Storing Dried Loose Teas

Since dried tea leaves tend to absorb all other scent and
flavors, they must be kept in an air tight container to remain
fresh and tasty. Thousand Cranes Teas come in a canister
that seal the air and moisture out. The worst enemy of dried
loose teas is air, especially moist air. Store your tea in a cool
place but not in the refrigerator or freezer.

Section 4       Six Tips for Fast and Easy Stress Management

                        By Kevin Polk, Ph.D

Stress Tip 1: Pay attention to your own thoughts.  Ever heard
the saying, "Sticks and stones will break my  bones, but words
will never hurt me?" It's a lie. Words hurt  (they stress you
out). That goes for words you think to  yourself as well. "The
power of positive thinking" may be a  cliché these days, but
it's still true. Think positive  thoughts and you feel less
stressed and get more done. It's  the most powerful stress
management you can do.

Stress Tip 2: Choose a couple of things you really want to  get
done, and get them done early in the day. You will feel  a sense
of accomplishment about using your time wisely. That  leads to
less stress. You can then choose another couple of  things to do
if you have time. The trick is to not overload  the day with
things to do, but still get stuff done.

Stress Tip 3: Look at your day as 24-hours instead of 8 or  12
or whatever. 24-hours is all that you've got. So if you  "add"
something to your day you will have to "subtract"  something
else from your day for good stress management. In  the U.S. we
tend to add without subtracting. That leads to a  lot of stress.

Stress Tip 4: Be assertive with people about your time.  While
time is our most precious resource, most of us tend to  give it
away too easily and that's poor stress management.  When someone
asks you for time, think about what you will  have to "subtract"
from your current schedule. That will  help you say "No" when
you need to. "No" can be a great  stress management tool.

Stress Tip 5: Have a dream and goals to reach that dream.
Sounds like another cliché, but stress management is a lot
easier when you have a dream and know what you want to do to
get there. (This does not mean go overboard and spend every
waking moment on obtaining the dream.) In the long run you  will
have less stress if you have a dream. It's sort of  automatic
stress management.

Stress Tip 6: Limit the number of shocking things you watch  on
television. I know that's tough in our TV centered world,  but
shocking pictures stress you a lot more than you think.  The
images go straight from you eyes to your feelings. If  you feel
yourself getting stressed by the television,  consider listening
to the radio. Radio allows you think  about the information and
form images you can deal with. Stress management has a lot to do
with controlling what you  see and hear, so choose wisely.
