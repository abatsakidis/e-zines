====================                               issue 6

    Here we are again! I hope you all enjoyed our first Question and
Answer Supplement. For the Your Life-Your Choice Newcomers,
The next supplement will be published on March 15 and you'll be
able to find the current one in the archives of the Your Life-Your
Choice Headquarters shortly. As always, I like to hear your feedback.
So does Dr. Abrams. That's how we know to provide you with
services that you want and need. By the way, I was finally able to
"scoop" a picture of Dr. Abrams... he's so shy! :) You can catch a
glimpse of him at the Your Life-Your Choice Headquarters... Meet
Dr. Abrams page.

    Oh, come closer... I have a secret to tell you! Come closer!!!
A new theraputic solution has been brought to my attention.
I was very intrigued hearing about it and I know you'll be interested
in it too. This is unique from similar therapies in that it delves
deeper to resolve the problem rather than merely helping you to
cope with the symptoms. This new therapy has seen amazing results
in Australia. It's not likely that you'll be able to find any additional

information about this. So I've encouraged the author to share with
us as much as he can. I've also arranged for a special issue featuring
only this new therapy. All things going as planned, you should see it
on March 8. Now I have to stop talking about this because I'm so
excited to be able to share this with you that I'll spill the whole
story!
Stay tuned.

Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I was introduced to a product that has changed my life.  It is Maui
Noni Capsules.  I have been sick for 10 years with CFIDS/FM
(Chronic Fatigue & Immune Dysfunction/Fibromyalgia). Three
months ago a friend gave me a bottle to try.  Within 2 weeks, I
noticed my energy level had gone up.
Now, I don't mean way up, but up for CFS patients. I take 2 caps
10 minutes before breakfast. I can not imagine my life without it. It
gives me that little push to be able to function again. Most times I
can walk to the store without my wheelchair, and do the steps
without my step-lift.
    Also, I have diverticulosis, leaky gut, and a yeast problem in the
intestines.  My doctor told me about Nutraflora FOS Powder. You
can get this at any health food store. I don't wake up nauseated
anymore. The pains have all but gone from my stomach and intestines.
It also regulated my bowl movements, which haven't been normal
since I was 18, I am 59.  I almost had a party to celebrate when the
first natural movement arrived.  Now, this has been 2 months.  There
are many web sites out there with information. I hope this will help
you out in some way.  I sure can't live without these products.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

At one time I never believed in alternative medicine.  Until I became
very ill in 1993.  I went from doctor to doctor and had every test
known to mankind. Finally I went to an alternative medicine doctor that
my brother recommended.  This doctor uses a diagnostic method called
Contact Reflex Analysis.  Within five minutes he  told me that I
suffered from Formaldehyde Poisoning. Once under his care, I became
stronger, and better. Alternative medicine has changed my life and the
way I feel!
This doctor takes the time to sit down and explain things to me, the way

no medical doctor I've ever been to has done.  He uses natural food
supplements and minerals to keep my immune system up and running on
course.  Now I find out that our governement is trying to stop the
distribution of supplements  and close down health food stores!!!  They
want only medical doctors to be able to distribute supplements by
prescription only!!!  If people don't start standing up for their
rights, what's next?  The governement program is called CODEX
anyone who wants more information can contact any health food
store or an alternative medicine doctor. I know that if they DO
succeed in doing this...I WILL continue to be a patient of this doctor
NO MATTER WHAT!!!  He has changed my life THAT much.

Diana

Section 3    GOOD NUTRITION STARTS WITH THE BASICS
                                            By Jan Rosenstreich

                                        http://www.castle.net/~mystic/
Jan's exposure to the world of metaphysics started in the late 1970's
with meditation through the Transcendental Meditation Movement.
Since then he has pursued his studies of Reflexology at the Well Person
Place, Reiki II, and completed a 3 year course of study that covered a
variety of holistic health & healing topics.
----------

I have heard the following statement many times, "you can get all the
nutrients your body needs by eating a well balanced diet". While I
believe this may have been true over 50 years ago, I have serious
doubts about the validity of the above statement at this time.

The quality of the soil has a large effect on the amount of nutrients
found in produce, grains, etc. Soil that is tired and full of chemicals
is
probably nutrient deficient. The widespread use of petrochemical
fertilizers has increased crop yields in the short term but is causing
other concerns. It encourages the overuse of the land which depletes
the potential nutrients. In addition, the plants are sprayed with
herbicides and pesticides during the farming process. These
chemicals get into our air, water and the food chain. Many are
considered carcinogens.

Food processing removes even more nutrients from the food. It is
interesting the way it works; processing strips out the nutrients and
then some are added back in and the product is then called "fortified".
Unfortunately, the trace elements are gone forever and most nutrients
added are probably synthetic and of questionable quality and quantity.

There is a growing concern about the quality of food we consume. People
are starting to realize that some of the disease and illness is
traceable
back to the food we eat. They are becoming aware that most commercially
grown food is full of pesticides, herbicides, and is of questionable
nutritional
value. These chemicals can cause a wide range of health problems. The
public is also learning that there are other choices.

The organic food industry has been growing at a rapid rate. Between the
years of 1989 and 1995, sales have grown by over 20% per year. Organic
growing practices are better for the environment and better for the
soil.
Organic products are free of the dangerous chemicals and are more
nutritious and tasty. One thing that has kept the organic industry
growth
from "exploding" are the relatively high shelf prices. What consumers
don't
realize is that the real cost of NON organic food is as high or higher
than
organic food. This is because of government subsidies, the cost of
cleaning
up the polluted air and water, and the effect on the health care system
(of both farmers and the public eating the products). These hidden costs

are NOT added to the shelf price of cheaper non organic foods. As the
demand for organic produce increases and more farms switch to more
organic methods, the price will probably come down.

Here are some suggestions for people who want to take steps to improve
their health:

1.Buy organically grown food whenever possible. Find out where it is
grown and favor locally grown over distant sources. The fresher the
food, the
more nutrients are retained and available to you.

2.Buy produce that is in season in your area when possible.

3.Buy whole grains rather than processed grains (organic brown rice vs.
processed white rice).

4.If you buy packaged foods, make sure they are free of artificial
preservatives, colorings, flavorings, and the ingredients are
organically
grown.

5.Consider taking a good quality multiple vitamin. You may also need to
take other supplements as required by your body.

Of course, there is a lot more to proper nutrition than the information
presented above. Use your common sense and become an educated
consumer.

Section 4                   Cleansing - the Key to Good Health
                                                     Brigitte Synesael

Having found a line of herbal combinations specially formulated by top
scientists in North America to provide optimum results, Brigitte
Synesael has spent the past 2 1/2 years promoting wellness through the
use of herbal supplementation. Further details can be found at:
http://www.Life-choices.com/herbal/.
Being the editor of Your Life-Your Choice has opened up Brigitte's
awareness and strengthened her conviction  to many types of alternative
and complementary forms of medical treatments. The Your Life-Your
Choice Headquarters contains many informative opportunities and can be
found at http://www.Life-Choices.com.
----------

    With equal conviction health care practitioners from all fields
recognize the remendous health benefits of internal cleansing and highly

endorse it. A lifetime of neglect and abuse to our bodies results in a
backlog of fats, toxins, and waste that encourage free radicals,
parasites,
and disease. If we do not eliminate properly and regularly, our kidneys
and liver become overloaded with fats causing them to work
inefficiently.
As a result the blood is not cleansed so poisons and toxins flow through

the system causing skin and heart problems. Colons become backlogged
with waste due to insufficient fiber in the diet.  Free radicals run
ramped
and parasite infestation becomes a problem.
    A proper cleansing can purge and strengthen the body's major organs
and support essential systems. This involves a number of herbal
combinations to address the major complex organs within us.
    The following suggests an effective program for cleansing. You will
want to consider following this program in its' entirety about once
every
year for general maintenance.

Your daily regime should include a quality Fiber supplement. Fiber
accomplishes many beneficial tasks not the least of which includes
colon cleansing. The Surgeon General Recommends 35 grams of
fiber per day. This is a MINIMUM requirement for SATISFACTORY
health… not Optimum health. A good Fiber supplement will contain
equal parts of Soluble and Insoluble fiber; your body needs both. Note
that it is imperative that you drink 8 glasses of water daily.
Incorporating
an herbal tea containing Senna (a natural laxative) will help stimulate
the
colon. This combination supports the digestive system and daily use will

maintain proper elimination.

Black Walnut is an herb that is very useful against fungal and parasitic

infections; used over a three-month period will help to dissipate any
parasite infestation.

An intensified two-week program of the following combinations will help
to purge and strengthen other major organs.

        o Acidophilus can help increase the friendly bacteria in the
            colon, which is essential for proper digestion and the
            production of B vitamins. It can help strengthen the
            immune system and reduce toxic waste in the large intestine.

        o Red Clover is a wonderful blood cleanser, and combined with
           other herbs can have a tremendous cleansing effect on the
entire
           body. This has been known to supply energy to the body's
            systems, increase circulation, and eliminate toxic
chemicals.
        o Dandelion supports the liver and gallbladder. It has been
            known to detoxify poisons, clear liver obstructions, and
            provide nutrients for healthy function.
        o Cascara Sagrada works as a natural laxative and colon
            cleanser. Cleansing occurs in both the large and small
            intestine. This can be very effective if taken after each
            meal while taking a fiber and herbal tea supplement to
           assist with bowel elimination.
        o Juniper Berries supports the kidney and bladder functions.
            Combine with other ingredients like Echinacea,
            Marshmallow, Watermelon Seeds, Uva Ursi, Parsley, and
            Ginger; and you have a powerful combination for purging
            the kidneys, promoting urination, increasing circulation,
and
            providing strength against infections.

    Some people experience flu-like symptoms during the first 2-3 days
of this program. This is simply the body eliminating toxins. By going
through this total cleansing process you will notice more energy and a
general healthier feeling. This is an excellent beginning... like
starting
with a clean slate.  From here you can reevaluate your health situation
and determine a targeted approach for specific issues.

"If the day and night are such that you greet them with joy and life
emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet scented herbs - that is your
success. All nature is your congratulations." - Henry David Thoreau

Our human body is indeed able to experience joy in the sweet fragrance
of flowers and herbs. Breathe the aromatic vapors of pure essential oils

and you may feel your melancholy lift. A calmness within your being may
be noticed, or your mind may focus more easily. This is aromatherapy.

Many are talking of aromatherapy - the use of essential oils for
healing. The life essence extracted from flowers, trees and herbs is
called
an essential oil. This extracted life essence is truly alive!

You can feel the therapeutic effect simply by breathing the aromatic
vapors of an essential oil. When we breathe in air, the aroma molecule
is translated into a signal by the receptor cells in the nose. This
signal
is sent to the olfactory bulb and then on to the limbic and hypothalamus

parts of the brain.

While it is not scientifically proven - it is believed that the
essential oil aroma activates the "pharmacy" within our brains; the
neurochemicals. These neurochemicals (serotonin, endorphins, etc.)
are the "words" that our brain uses to communicate with our nervous
and other body systems. For example, the aroma of a calming oil
would cause release of seratonin, a euphoric aroma - release of
endorphin, a stimulating oil - release of noradrenalin. Pain relief and
other physical effects are also experienced when these neurochemicals
are released. Studies have been done on the effects of essential oils on

brain waves. A rhythm exhibiting calmness was produced when an oil
known as a sedative was inhaled, and a stimulating aroma caused an
alert response.

So we see that our mind can play an important role in our well being. It

can also play a disruptive role. We live in times of much emotional and
mental stress. These stressors can range from work pressures and
financial
worries to relationship problems, grief and trauma. Scientific studies
have
shown that extreme stress can decrease the function of our immune
system.
Our mental health can be adversely affected as well.

As body and mind function together, extreme stress may cause physical
and emotional symptoms. We might feel helpless or depressed. Possibly we

experience headaches, digestive problems, or frequent infections. We may

feel anxious, irritable and have difficulty sleeping. We want to bring
the
body and mind back to peak functioning.

There are holistic ways to accomplish this .. and aromatherapy is one of

them. It can be of help by working through the brain - through the mind
- and through the emotions. We can experience in our mind how it might
work...

The tender yellow flower of the ylang ylang tree is so sweet - a flower
so worthy of love it is placed on a wedding bed in Indonesia. Imagine
breathing this exotic fragrance and feeling the joy in your body of its
natural perfume.

Now, close your eyes and feel the lush coolness of an immense forest
filled with cedars, trees of frankincense and sandalwood. Breathe deeply

the fresh scent of those timeless trees. Feel the calm as your mind and
being become centered.

... these are the joys of a life that "emits a fragrance like flowers
and sweet
scented herbs" ..

                                                Talking to Plants

One way to promote great health and balance is to have a living space
that nurtures you.  One aspect of creating a "living" space is to have a

lot of beautiful plants.  Sometimes I think my "place on the lake" is
turning into a botanical garden!  Anyway, I have a large leafed tropical

plant that I really enjoy and over the last few months it has been
slowly dying.  Most of stalks were completely bent as if the leaves had
become too heavy.  So the other day I felt inspired to start talking to
this
plant. Wishing it well, "sending" it positive thoughts (you know,
Celestine
Prophesy stuff).  Well, the next day THE PLANT WAS ALMOST
COMPLETELY REVIVED!  I was truly amazed.

Positive, loving energy is healthy for your body and for plants too.

                            Old home remedies rid readers of colds
                                By Tracy L. Pipp / The Detroit News

What's your remedy for recovering from a cold? Readers share
their secrets:

* "Zinc lozenges and homemade potato soup with kluskis,"
    says N.J. Montgomery of Westland.
* "A nice hot cup of echinacea tea with lemon and honey,"
    says Pat Trotter of Detroit.
* "Lots of vitamin C and echinacea, and comfort food like
    mashed potatoes and hot chocolate,"
    says Connie Butler of Auburn Hills.

The Barnes and Noble gift certificate goes to Ken Kustarz of
Sterling Heights, who says the best treatment for a cold is to
avoid getting one in the first place.
"I used to rest and eat chicken soup and drink liquids, but for the last

10 years I've been eating fresh garlic and cayenne pepper prior to
getting sick and I haven't had a cold since," he says.
