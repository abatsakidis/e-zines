Section 2                 Asthma
                            By Dr. Heil

Dr. Heil is a Doctor of Chiropractic in private practice for
over 13 years. The emphasis of his practice is preventative
care. During the 9 years that it took him to obtain his Doctor
of Chiropractic degree he also successfully completed the
requirements of the Department of Chemistry and Nutrition
at the National College of Chiropractic, located in Lombard,
Illinois. You can view Dr. Heil's resume and professional
background information at http://home.onestop.net/heilresume;

                                --------------------

Five million kids suffer from asthma. The number of kids
with asthma has almost doubled since 1983. Why is the
number increasing? Because we are treating the symptoms
while ignoring the cause of asthma.

Asthma involves the bronchi and bronchioles, the tiny tubes
that carry air to the lungs. When a person has asthma their
bronchi and bronchioles go into spasm, close up and fill
with mucous. They feel like they are being strangled. They
struggle to get air into the lungs and once it is in they cannot
exhale; the air is trapped behind the mucous.

It's sometimes described as being underwater and not able to
swim to the surface in time. Asthmatics struggle for every breath.

The asthma attack or spasm can last for several hours. In
its most severe form, status asthmaticus, the attacks last
for days and even weeks and can result in death. Over 5
million Americans, a third of them children, suffer from
asthma. What can be done for them?

Modern medicine offers no cure. The best it can do is give
temporary relief of symptoms by the use of drugs. Many
asthmatics feel condemned to a life of drug taking without
ever getting rid of their condition. However, many asthmatics
are turning to the drugless healing of Chiropractic combined
with nutritional supplementation.

According to Dr. Daniel Wise, a Phoenix Maryland Doctor
of Chiropractic with a large pediatric practice, most asthma
sufferers are suffering unnecessarily.

Dr. Wise utilizes the Activator Methods technique of Chiropractic
care (http://www.activator.com/) in conjunction with nutritional
supplementation. He points out that Pneumotrophin in tandem
with Drenamin is very beneficial for asthmatics when combined
with a comprehensive program of chiropractic care. However,
he cautions that other nutritional factors may be present and
recommends that a Nutritional Health Survey (NHS) be
completed by all asthma sufferers and the suggestions followed.
The NHS can be found at http://www.healthmc.com/.

Chiropractic successes with asthmatics are well documented.
Yet its purpose in caring for people is not to treat disease,
asthma included. The purpose of Chiropractic is to remove
nerve interference or spinal stress from the body. You might
say that chiropractors care for the person who has the disease
rather that the disease that has the person.


As early as 1921, Henry Winsor, M.D., performed autopsies
on 70 people that had respiratory disease. Dr. Winsor found
spinal abnormalities associated with breathing in all 70 cases.
An article recently published in "Spinal Manipulation," a
chiropractic journal, showed that patients with a history of
asthma or bronchitis are more likely to report respiratory
improvement after chiropractic treatment.

Section 3   RIGHT AND WRONG MAGNETIC THERAPY
         PRACTICES and Pointers That Will Improve Your Results.

       This report is written by Boyce N. Berkel, M.D.
It was condensed and adapted by permission from
Dr. William H. Philpotts book "Critical Review of
Currently Practiced Magnetic Therapy." Dr. Philpott
is currently doing FDA approved research in Magnetic
Therapy, and is taking applications. For more information
on this timely and very fascinating subject, go to
http://www.uniquenterprises.com/magnets

                              --------------------

In any discussion on magnetic therapy, the questions
invariably comes up. Is there an advantage to using one
pole (e.g. the south pole) over the other (e.g. the north
pole), or exposure to a mixed positive and negative
magnetic field?

The answers to this questions is important. You see, many
have gotten less than satisfactory results, because of the lack
of knowledge of the proper use of magnets. As an example,
does it make sense to arrive to the conclusion that water does
not quench your thirst, if on a hot summer day, with your throat
parched, and languishing from thirst, you drank a thimble full of
lukewarm water rather than a glassful of cold refreshing water?
Using a weaker magnet than is appropriate, and not using the
most effective pole of the magnet, can leave you with less than
optimal results.

To answer these questions, we need to understand a little,
how magnetic therapy works, and how your body responds
when exposed to magnetic energy.

The body has a mechanism of stress reflex (counter-irritant
effect). There are many examples of this, such as acupuncture
signaling a response in a particular area of the body, or pressure
massage on the sole of the feet signaling the brain to respond to
a particular area of the body.

Now injury or stress produces a positive magnetic response in
the area of injury or stress. Your body's stress reflex (Counter-
irritant reflex), is to send negative magnetic energy down to the
area of injury to counter the positive magnetic response. It is the
negative magnetic energy that provides the relief. Here's an
example of how that works. An irritating liniment is applied to an
arthritic joint, in which the irritating liniment provides some relief.
In reality, it is the counter-irritant response of sending negative
magnetic energy to the area, that provides the relief.

Many are using magnetic fields as as counter-irritant without
realizing what they are doing. A low level positive magnetic field,
or low level mixed positive and negative magnetic field is a mild
irritant to which the body will respond by countering with a
negative magnetic field. In any event, it is the negative magnetic
energy that does the relieving and not the positive magnetic
energy.

This why some people have thought the magnetic poles were
not different, because they found relief with either pole. This is
true if you are low enough on your gauss strength, or your
duration is short enough where you don't get the effect of the
positive magnetic, but rather the counter-irritant reflex response.

Another aspect of this is that when the counter irritant reflex
stimulant is used, there is a rapid response, often occurring
within 3 minutes. Whereas, if you apply the negative magnetic
field from a magnet, it would not be this quick. The response
could take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes or more.

In using the positive magnetic pole, or the low level mixed
positive and negative magnetic field, many are impressed
that they are doing the right thing, because of this quick
response. However, there are problems inherent in using
the reflex response method as compared to the non reflex
response method of obtaining relief.

The counter irritant reflex response fatigues out in time, and
the symptoms return in spite of continued treatment. This does
not happen when the nagative magnetic field is used. Also, the
response is predictably the same no matter how long the
exposure to the negative magnetic field.

Next month you will find out the effects of prolonged
exposure to the positive magnetic pole and why it is not
generally recommended.  You will also find out why the
negative magnetive field exposure is recommended to treat
injuries, infections, inflammation, edema, neoplasms, and to
restore energy.
