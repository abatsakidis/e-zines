                  Letter from the Editor

        Back together again! Just in time for another issue 
of Your Life-Your Choice. It's Thanksgiving weekend 
here in Canada, so I'm going to keep this editorial really 
short. I have a date with a turkey! :)

    I do have one special request. One of our subscribers 
is a first year student in Naturopathy. He lives and studies 
in South Africa. Because Naturopathy is not yet common 
there, he is anxious to be involved as much as possible; 
for instance to attend seminars, workshops, meetings, etc.
Would any subscribers who are (or know of) certified 
Naturopaths in South Africa be so kind as to send an email: 
mailto:yourlife@life-choices.com giving me permission for 
this gentleman to contact you for further information along 
this line. I know your assistance will be appreciated.

Until next time Your Life-Your Choice wishes you
health and prosperity.

  Section 3              Psoriasis - Not a Pretty Sight

 ----------

 During normal skin production, skin cells begin at the
bottom layer of skin. As they mature, they rise up from the
bottom layer to the top layer (called the epidermis). In a
healthy body this process should take about 28 days.

 About 2% of the population in both the United States
and Europe battle with a skin disease called Psoriasis. It
occurs when the skin cells do not produce normally.
Typically psoriasis is recognized by large patches of red,
inflamed skin having a silvery, scaly surface. Although this
condition is not contagious, heredity is a significant factor.

 This is a heartbreaking disease for two reasons; it can
cause a great deal of constant physical discomfort, and with
the affected areas being so apparent it is often socially
embarrassing as well.

 There are three main types of psoriasis:

Discoid or "Plaque" Psoriasis - This is the most common
form. Patches appear on the trunk and limbs, particularly the
elbows and knees, and on the scalp. Usually the nails also
become pitted or thickened. Nails may even separate from the
nail bed.

Guttate Psoriasis - This type occurs most frequently in
children. Numerous small patches develop rapidly covering a
wide area of skin. Often this will occur after a soar throat.

Pustular Psoriasis - Small pistules form in this type and can
appear anywhere on the body or be confined to specific areas,
like the palms or soles of the feet.

 The exact cause of psoriasis in not known. However
there are a number of deficiencies that are believed to be at
the source of the condition. Frequently, emotional stress may
be a contributing factor. Skin trauma, surgery and physical
illness may encourage a psoriasis attack. Deficiencies in the
liver and the digestive system can also be at the root of the
problem.

 Mild cases of psoriasis can be helped by
phototherapy, exposure to ultraviolet lamps. Typically
doctors will prescribe emollient creams. More serious attacks
are often treated with ointments containing coal tar or
dithranol. Other medical treatments include Methotrexate and
corticosteroid drugs. Extreme caution should be used when
interacting with Methotrexate or Rheumatrex. This is a
highly toxic drug and should only be prescribed by a
physician familiar with its properties. It can have devastating
side effects if not used properly.

 For a more natural approach, people suffering from
psoriasis are encouraged to avoid alcohol, fats from meat and
dairy products, white sugar, white flour, and citrus fruits. A
stronger diet of raw foods,  sesame seeds and fish (tuna,
salmon, and sardines) and increasing fiber in the diet will help
keep this condition under control.

 From a vitamin perspective you'll find that increasing
the following vitamins will help your struggle with psoriasis.
Vitamins A, B Complex, and Zinc are necessary for healthy
skin, hair and nails. Vitamin D helps to heal the skin.
Lecithin emulsifies fats and protects cells. Switching to
Sunflower oil which contains lecithin may be helpful.

 Herbs can be tremendously helpful in addressing this
condition and typically don't carry the side effects that often
accompany traditional treatments. There are several herbs
that can be helpful.  Availability may determine your
selection. Dandelion strengthens the liver which is often
damaged in skin diseases like this.  Poultices can be made
from Chaparral, Dandelion and Yellow Dock. Lavender
fights inflammation and can soothe and help heal irritated
skin. It can be mixed with Olive Oil and applied externally.
Add 2 teaspoons of Ginger to bath water. Milk Thistle
protects the liver which is necessary to keep the blood clean.
It been recommended to take 300 milligrams 3 times daily.
Red Clover is an excellent blood cleanser and can be very
instrumental in resolving this condition. Golden Seal is
another herb that can be of benefit when dealing with
psoriasis.

 It is important to note that you should ALWAYS
consult a qualified health care professional when dealing with
a serious health condition. This can be your Herbalist,
Naturopath, Nutritionist, Homeopath, family doctor, or any
other certified practitioner you trust. They can advise you
about appropriate quantities for your specific condition, or
counsel you about possible conflicts with other medication
you may be on.

    One of the joys of the season is the opportunity to travel,
whether it's a trip to the nearest beach or a destination far
away. The feeling of anticipation and adventure precedes
the journey but often one is faced with weariness and
discomfort, especially if the trip is a long one. Just as you
would pack a first-aid kit, why not include some of your
essential oils to make your journey more pleasant and
memorable. Here are a few suggestions:

Travel sickness:

There is nothing worse than that horrible "land locked" type
of sea sickness to spoil that wonderful ride on a winding
mountain road. Peppermint oil has a great calming effect
on the stomach. Two drops of peppermint oil placed on a
tissue and inhaled will help. A drop of ginger oil diluted in a
little vegetable oil can be rubbed on the upper abdomen to
bring about relief.

Preventing frayed nerves and road rage:

Passengers and drivers can keep cool and collected even in
stop and go traffic jams. Place a drop of lavender, eucalyptus
or peppermint oil on one of two cotton balls and put in the
rear window shelf of the car. Before starting out on a lengthy
journey, try a bath with two drops of basil oil. This helps to
keep you alert while driving.

Fear of flying:

Place a tissue with one drop of lavender and one drop of
geranium in a little plastic bag. When those "flight flutters"
begin, hold the tissue to your nose for a moment. If the flight
attendant inquires about your cold, just tell her that you are
allergic to the peanuts served by the airline, ha, ha.

A fidgety young child on a long flight? Use a massage oil made
up of 15 drops of chamomile oil in 30 ml of a light nut or
vegetable oil. Massage this mixture on the legs and feet.

Travel Weary? Try this dry inhalation method when on a trip:
it refreshes weary travelers and helps to settle an upset stomach,
perhaps due to motion sickness. On a handkerchief combine
these oils and inhale when required: bergamot 5 drops, lavender
3 drops, petitgrain 3 drops, lime 2 drops, lemon 1 drop

Well there you are! All set for a wonderful "travel filled" season.
But before we close here's some help for facing the inevitable:
returning to work after that great holiday. Getting back into
routine is not easy, so let those essential oils provide some help.
Try a blend of 2 drops of each of geranium and peppermint oil
in your bath to soften the blow.

Safe, happy and comfortable journeying.

Section 6                          First Aid Tips

    When someone is injured or suddenly becomes ill, there is
usually a critical period before you can get medical treatment
and it is this period  that is of the utmost importance to the victim.
What you do, or what you  don't do, in that interval can mean the
difference between life and death. You owe it to yourself, your
family and your neighbors to know and to  understand procedures
that you can apply quickly and intelligently in an emergency.

    Every household should have some type of first aid kit, and if
you do not  already have one, assemble your supplies now. Tailor
the contents to fit  your family's particular needs. Don't add first
aid supplies to the jumble of  toothpaste and cosmetics in the
medicine cabinet. Instead, assemble them  in a suitable, labeled
box (such as a fishing tackle box or small tool chest  with hinged
cover), so that everything will be handy when needed. Label
everything in the kit clearly, and indicate what it is used for.

    Be sure not to lock the box - otherwise you may be hunting
for the key when that emergency occurs. Place the box on a
shelf beyond the reach of small children, and check it periodically
and always restock items as soon as they are used up.

    Keep all medications, including non-prescription drugs such
as aspirin, out of reach of children. When discarding drugs, be
sure to dispose of them where they cannot be retrieved by
children or pets.

    When an emergency occurs, make sure the injured victim's
airway is not blocked by the tongue and that the mouth is free
of any secretions and foreign objects. It is extremely important
that the person is breathing freely. And if not, you need to
administer artificial respiration promptly.

    See that the victim has a pulse and good blood circulation as you
check for signs of bleeding. Act fast if the victim is bleeding severely
or if he/she has swallowed poison or if his/her heart or breathing has
stopped. Remember every second counts.

    Although most injured persons can be safely moved, it is vitally
important not to move a person with serious neck or back injuries
unless you have to save him/her from further danger. Keep the
patient lying down and quiet. If he/she has vomited and there is no
danger that his/her neck is broken, turn him/her on his/her side to
prevent choking and keep him/her warm by covering him/her with
blankets or coats.

    Have someone call for medical assistance while you apply first
aid. The person who summons help should explain the nature of the
emergency and ask what should be done pending the arrival of the
ambulance. Reassure the victim, and try to remain calm yourself.
Your calmness can allay the fear and panic of the patient.

    Don't give fluids to an unconscious or semiconscious person;
fluids may enter his/her windpipe and cause suffocation. Don't try
to arouse an unconscious person by slapping or shaking.

    Look for an emergency medical identification card or an
emblematic device that the victim may be wearing to alert you
to any health problems, allergies or diseases that may require
special care.
