                 Letter from the Editor


March seems to be a busy month for everyone. In our last 
issue we talked about this being Nutrition month. Well, it 
seems that Arthritis also has a claim to March. Arthritis is 
a condition that affects well over 60 million people worldwide. 
We would be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge this debilitating 
disease. 

There are some 100 to 170 different types of arthritis with 
joint, muscle and/or bone pain being common in virtually all 
of them. Being completely undiscriminating, arthritis affects 
people of all races and of all ages, including children.

Although it is still unknown as to what specifically causes 
arthritis, an effective "management therapy" can usually be 
arranged by your local health care provider. An accurate 
diagnosis early in the development stage is very important 
to successful treatment.

There are far too many forms of arthritis to address adequately 
in this limited space so instead I’d like to share with you some 
ideas to help you overcome daily challenges when the pain is 
difficult to bear. 

1) Whether in the workshop or in the kitchen, use tools with 
larger, easier to grip handles, preferably with non slip handles.
Even cooking utensils (including forks, knives, and spoons) 
can be purchased with larger handles for easier control.

2) Convert door knobs and kitchen & bathroom taps so that 
they use levers instead of harder to grip round knobs.

3) Use raised seats, they’re easier to get up from and put 
less strain on knee joints.

4) Instead of using your fingers, use the palms, forearms or 
elbows. Close plastic containers with your elbow.

5) Place a strap on refrigerator doors and cupboards. To open, 
place your forearm through the strap and pull.
6) To wash dishes use a scrubber that fits over your hand 
and keeps your fingers straight.

7) Use your hip to close kitchen drawers.

8) Carry your purse on your forearm or use a shoulder bag to 
avoid putting the strain on your hand.

9) Use splints or wraps that support wrist, thumbs, and finger.

10) Use pipe insulation or buy rubber "grips" to put around 
pens or spoons for easier grip.

If you have other suggestions that have been helpful to you 
or to someone you know, please email us at:
mailto:yourlife@life-choices.com with "Arthritis Tip" in the 
subject heading.

Massage Therapy is one of the oldest forms of pain management 
for arthritis. The amount of pressure that is applied can be 
adjusted depending on the level of pain. Avoid massaging 
directly on top of an inflamed joint as this may be too painful 
for the area. For best results massage just above and just below 
the joint. Blending essential oils like eucalyptus, lavender, 
peppermint, rosewood, and wintergreen with a sweet almond 
oil carrier will make a welcome addition to your massage. 

Devil’s Claw has been used in Africa and German medical 
clinics because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Although 
it is used for numerous health conditions, Devil’s Claw has 
been particularly helpful in dealing with arthritis and other 
inflammatory related diseases. One caution, however... 
Devil's Claw does encourage gastric secretions and should 
not be used by someone with gastric ulcers.

Yucca has been used for hundreds of years to treat the pain 
and inflammation of various forms of arthritis. 

Although only effective with some types of arthritis, 
Glucosamine Sulfate is being recognized for its’ success 
with osteoarthritis. 

Primrose or salmon oil can also help control arthritis pain 
and inflammation. 

There are many other herbs that can be helpful. However, 
you are encouraged to discuss these options with your local 
health care provider BEFORE adding them to your regime. 
Your overall health and any medications you are taking
may have an impact on the effect these herbs will have.

Section 1      Golfer’s Elbow and Tennis Elbow


                    by Christina Barrett 
                    mailto:cbr@glinx.com  

-----

I started thinking about these conditions the other 
day when a hairdresser client of mine, who plays neither 
of these sports, came in with a diagnosis of both in her
 right elbow. She couldn't understand how she could 
possibly have either one. This led to a discussion of what 
they are and how they are caused.

	Golfer's Elbow is also known as medial epicondylitis. 
The medial epicondyle is the bony lump on the lower part of 
your upper arm bone (the humerus) closest to your body. This 
is where the muscles that bend, or flex, your wrist and 
fingers attach. Any gripping movement or repetitive motion 
that involves flexing can lead to irritation and injury to 
the muscles, which in turn can cause inflammation and pain. 
Its name comes from the fact that it is fairly common among 
golfers as a result of the golf swing.

	The hairdresser, who I am using for an example, is 
right handed. Her left hand usually holds the comb or the 
hair while she uses her right hand to snip with scissors, 
use the blow dryer and so on. It's easy to see that she is 
repeatedly moving her fingers and wrist and it is not all 
that surprising that her elbow is rebelling after twenty 
years or so of being overworked.

	Tennis Elbow, or lateral epicondylitis has similar 
origins. The muscles that attach on the outer part of the 
lower humerus serve to straighten or extend the fingers and 
wrist, and to stabilize the wrist when the fingers are 
closed. Think of using a screwdriver. Your hand closes 
tightly around the handle, but your wrist stays straight. 
Often related to the backhand swing of a tennis racket, 
hence the name, it is also caused by other activities.

	Back to the hairdresser and how she uses her hands 
and arms and we can see again that the repetitive nature of 
her work is the most likely culprit. 

	To treat both conditions, I have been focusing on 
all the muscles that attach around her elbow. I start with 
her shoulder, to loosen the muscles and to warm the tissues. 
I then make my way down the arm to the elbow. Because she 
has both in one arm, it's a little more challenging than 
treating one or the other. From the attachment points on 
the epicondyles, I work down the forearms, using a 
combination of techniques that include muscle squeezing, 
thumb stroking, kneading, palmar stroking and shaking. 
One goal is to help the muscles to relax and soften which 
will decrease the pull on the attachment points somewhat. 
Another goal is to increase the local circulation to bring 
oxygen and nutrients to the injured tissue to help them 
recover faster. 

	In cases where there is inflammation, ice massage 
might be called for to minimize the inflammatory response 
to the direct hands-on work on the tissues. I recommend 
self massage, or gentle muscle squeezing at home from a 
friend or family member between sessions to keep the 
tension at bay. 

	When either of these become very bad, a person's 
medical doctor might recommend cortisone shots or surgery. 
I like to see someone try less invasive techniques, like 
massage, first, but each person must ultimately choose 
what is right and best for them.

Section 2    Nineteen Foods to Prevent Breast Cancer!

----------

Recent research suggests that adding these foods to your
diet could significantly lower your risk of breast cancer. 


#1 Yellow orange vegetables -- Eating foods high in beta-
carotene has been linked in many studies to lower rates of
breast cancer. Tip: Baby carrots beta-carotene is more 
absorbable then regular carrots and carrots beta-carotene
is 500% more absorbable than in raw carrots.

#2  
Cruciferous vegetables-- radish, broccoli, cauliflower,
rutabaga, cabbage, turnips, turnip greens, contain indole
-3-carbinol, which lowers women's levels of a type of 
estrogen that may promote breast cancer.(16-hydroxy-
estradiol and 16-hydroxy-estrone). Tip: Look for 
BroccoSprouts, a brand of broccoli sprouts with megalevels
 of SGS, a compound that fights mammary tumors in mice.  
      
#3 Warm a mug of 1%-2% organic hormone free milk (Alta Dena)
, add 1 tbs. ground almonds, pumpkin seed or walnuts or 
1/4 tbs. natural almond extract, and enjoy it at bedtime. 
Why not fat-free milk? Because there's an intriguing 
compound in milk fat (including butter)-- conjugated 
linoleic acid -- that fights breast cancer cells in test
tubes and animals. 

#4 Eat tomatoes, including cooked, dried, soups, juice 
and sauces, even Ketch-up to fill up on a compound called
lycopene. Diets high in lycopene are linked to lower rates
of breast and prostate cancer. 

#5 Give up the red wine and eat grapes instead. More 
than one alcoholic beverage a day increases your risk 
of breast cancer. But concord grapes have cancer-fighting 
antioxidant power.

#6  Eat cold water fish (salmon ,tuna*, anchovies, 
swordfish, polluck, crab, sardines) and omega-3 rich 
nuts and seeds (walnut, pumpkin, flax). Research 
suggests that women with higher tissue levels of 
omega-3s have lower rates of breast cancer. 
<*not light tuna.> 

#7 Women whose diets are higher in vitamin D have less 
breast cancer. To ensure that you get the recommended level,
add Vitamin D to a healthy diet, advise many experts, 
especially in climates or lifestyles with out year round 
sun (20 minutes a day).

#8 Eat a small bowel of dark cherries. Cherries are a top 
source  of a compound that may inhibit mammary cancer in 
rats.

#9 Compounds called limonoids, found in the peel and white
membrane of oranges, inhibit breast cancer in test tubes. 
Eat whole fruit oranges and tangerines. Look for herbal 
teas made w/ orange lemon peel. Use real orange and lemon
 oils in cooking and health drinks.

#10 Avoid refined grains and choose whole grains instead. 
At least one study has shown that women who ate the most
refined grains had more breast cancer. Another study 
showed women who ate one serving a day of a cereal high 
in wheat bran lowered their level of breast cancer
-promoting estrogen. 

#11 Use butter over margarine. Butter contains CLA's 
mentioned in #3. One study suggests that a diet higher 
in trans fats may increase the risk of breast cancer. 
Margarine, most french fries, both frozen and fast-food,
and many processed and fried foods made with hydrogenated 
fats are a top trans fat source. If you prefer margarine,
use a trans-fat free brand.

#12 Drink green tea, hot or cold. Green tea is rich in
EGCG, a compound that inhibits breast cancer cells in 
mice. Caffienated brands have twice as much potency 
as uncaffienated. And most bottled brands have little.
Mix with herbal teas and lemon peel for taste, or 
naturally sweeten with a little Concord grape juice 
or super low glycemic Agave.
 
#13 Instead of commercial "olive oil" dressings - 
usually made with a mixture of oils -- make your own 
easy dressing with half olive oil, half balsamic vinegar.
Mediterranean women who eat lots of olive oil have low
rates of breast cancer, studies show. 


#14 Garlic kills breast cancer cells in the test tube
and maybe in you. But if you're going to cook garlic,
always peel and chop, then let it rest for 10 to 15 
minutes before you heat. Heating right away doesn't 
allow time for the cancer-fighting compounds to develop. 
 
#15 Women in one study who ate a serving of spinach at
 least twice a week had half the rate of breast cancer
 of women who avoided it .

#16  Flavorful veggie burgers and sausage won't form 
the same compounds that meat does when it's being cooked
and those compounds may explain why women who eat 
lots of red meat and lots of very well done meat seem 
to get more breast cancer. 

#17 Why flaxseed? Because it has 75 times more lignin
precursors, compounds that inhibit mammary tumors in 
animals.

# 18 Add soy. Soy’s isoflavinoids work as weak estrogens,
blocking the more powerful estrogens from stimulating
estrogen sensitive cancer cells.


#19 Phyto herbs, like don quai, fennel, black cohosh
are also weak estrogens that compete with stronger 
estrogens for estrogen receptor sites. These are found 
in many "Change of life formulas".

The 20th step is to just do it!

Section 3      Weathering the Winter Cold and Flu Season
 
                      By: June Kaminski RN MSN 

                    mailto:junek@vancouver.quik.com

Winter is well known as the "cold and flu season". Around 
the globe, influenza and colds are a topic of concern in 
the colder months. Winter months often mean people spend 
most of their time indoors where exposure to viruses and 
bacteria can lead to the quick transmission of colds and 
influenza (the flu). Both of these acute infections play 
havoc with the normal functioning of daily family routine 
and work-place attendance and proficiency. As well they 
tend to make one feel simply miserable, lasting anywhere 
from one to two weeks in duration.

Particular concern is focused on preventing these 
infections in both the very young and the elderly members 
of the population. Research continues to look for remedies 
that can both control and cure the common cold and the 
more serious flus, offering flu vaccines and nutritional 
or herbal remedies for prevention and treatment. Still, a 
cure has yet to be discovered.

Ultimately, the onus to prevent catching a cold or the flu 
rests with people themselves. Strategies and self care 
practices can help in defining a personal action plan for 
boosting your immune system, and preventing contagion from 
sick folk around you. There are some promising findings 
available to help you choose the best prevention program 
for you and your loved ones. The suggestions offered here 
include those based on convincing research. There are other
recommendations available, particularly herbal ones which 
still require more research to be able to safely and 
convincingly include them in a cold and flu prevention 
program. 

	Nutrients for a Vital Immune System 

Several nutrients have been linked with a strong and responsive 
immune system. Vitamin C is recommended for boosting the 
immune system's ability to resist contagion of cold and 
flu microbes. Vitamin B6 is also valuable, but should 
ideally be taken as part of a multi-B complex preparation.
Consumption of an isolated B vitamin can potentiate deficiency symptoms in the other B vitamins. Vitamin A and E, Unsaturated 
fatty acids, Zinc and Beta carotene are also excellent immune 
system boosters. As well, adequate and complete Proteins are important for the vitality of the immune system for warding 
off infections of all kinds. 

	Herbal Helpers for Prevention and Treatment

Several herbs have been researched and are now commonly 
recommended for both prevention of colds and the flu and 
for treating them once they catch hold. 

Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is an immune system 
booster with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti 
viral properties. Its' direct effect on the influenza 
virus is still unknown. Astragalus is known to increase 
white blood cell production of the anti viral substance 
interferon, a response that tends to protect against 
viral invasion. More and more doctors and nutrition 
experts consider astragalus a good immune tonic for 
people who appear susceptible to infections. Astragalus 
has long been a common ingredient in traditional Chinese 
herbal medicine. 

Echinacea (Echinacea angustifolia, E. pallida, E. purpurea) 
is gaining a positive reputation for helping one to prevent 
colds and flu, and even for treatment, if taken at the 
beginning of the symptoms. Some research studies support 
the theory that it enhances immunity by stimulating immune 
cells. Echinacea also seems to stimulate white blood cell 
production. It appears to contain numerous anti viral 
compounds and has been used effectively to lessen the 
susceptibility to flu viruses. Native Americans have used 
echinacea for centuries to treat sore mouth and gums, 
toothache, coughs and as an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic 
agent.

Garlic (Allium sativum) is another supportive herb and food 
that boosts immune system function and appears to destroy 
bacteria, parasites, fungus and viruses including type B 
influenza virus. 

Ginger (Zingiber officinale)  contains anti viral, 
anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving and warming qualities 
which tend to relieve symptoms of both colds and flus. 

Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) shows great promise in 
preventing and treating active influenza, colds and 
other respiratory viruses. Studies suggest that it 
disables the enzyme that flu viruses use to penetrate 
cell membranes and inhibits a variety of both type A 
and type B influenza viruses.

In summary, particular nutrients and herbs combined 
with careful hygiene, adequate rest, regular exercise 
and a stress-free environment all interact to promote 
a vital and protective immune system in people of all 
ages. Ensuring your nutrition is as wholesome and 
balanced as possible is the first step in weathering 
the storm of the annual flu and cold season. As well, 
research suggests that certain herbs added to your 
nutritional plan can further boost your immune system's 
capability to resist infection and prevent disease.

4.		      Health Smart Recipe
			By Edna Laraway

	Because this recipe is high in Lycopene 
	  it is especially helpful for Breast 
		  Cancer Prevention
 
---
			Chunky Pasta Sauce


2 cans (28 fl oz) of Italian Plum Tomatoes*
1 small onion (diced)
4-5 stalks celery (diced)*
½ cup sweet or bell peppers*
2-3 cloves garlic (finely  minced)
3-4 bay leaves
¼ cup olive oil
1 tsp origano*
1 tsp sweet or italian basil*
1 tsp salt*
1 tsp black pepper
½ tsp chili pepper seeds (spicier - optional)
1 cup shredded carrots (optional)
1 can tomato paste

In four quart pot or dutch oven, add all ingredients
except tomato paste. Cover.  Heat to bubbling,
then turn down to simmer  for at least 1 hr. If you
find it too chunky, use masher  to crush tomatoes.
 Add tomato paste, and let simmer uncovered for
another ½ hr.  Stir occasionally.

Serve with pasta of your choice. Make sure you
try Whole Wheat Pasta.  There is very little
difference in taste but lots more nutrition.
Refrigerate leftovers to use as a sauce on baked
chicken, italian sausages, baked ribs, or on
oven baked potatoes, or baked zucchini.

Please remember that substitutions * are always
encouraged.  Most recipes can be adjusted to suit
personal preferences.  Use fresh herbs, but remember
to double amounts. Fresh herbs have less flavour.
If you dislike green peppers, use mushrooms
instead.  Experiment. If you don’t have basil or
oregano, use italian seasoning. If you have time,
use fresh tomatoes. Either blanch and peel before
using, or use food processor to puree tomato skins. 
Adjust cooking time.


Approx. Nutritional Values
2 cups paste      = 400cal, 2g fat, 5g fibre
1 cup pasta sauce = 250cal, 6g fat, 15g fibre.
