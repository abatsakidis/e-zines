Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

My mother-in-law was having a real problem with a weak 
bladder. Her homeopathic doctor encouraged her to take 
a combination of Juniper Berries and Echinacea. Within a 
week she noticed some improvement, and after a month 
her bladder was working normally. She's been absolutely 
thrilled with the results!

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

My daughter  was diagnosed with ADD - Attention 
Deficit Disorder. The doctor perscribed Ritalin for 
her. I didn't like the side effects it was having on her. 
I started giving her an herb originating from grape 
seed extract. Within a week we noticed a major 
difference. So far she's experience no side effects 
from this. She is now off Ritalin and her school 
work has improved 100%.

Section 3                  Holistic Dowsing 
                           By Joe Mullally 

Part two - GETTING STARTED 

If we approach dowsing as a 'conversation with the 
intuition' then our first step is to set up and agree a 
mutually understood language for this dialogue. Getting 
this part right is the key to obtaining reliable information 
from dowsing. We must bear in mind that we are 
dealing with the subconscious mind which has little 
critical faculty and so, everything we ask and say to it 
will be taken literally. For instance, in the UK one time, 
a hypnotised subject obeyed her hypnotist's instruction 
to go 'straight back to her seat in the audiance' to the 
letter, and promptly walked off the front of the stage 
(not thinking to go by the side stairs ) with tragic 
consequences. This is how literally the subconscious 
takes suggestions and this is why it is so important to
'get our language right'. The attention, time and patience 
we give to this one factor, will have a crucial impact on 
our working results. The considered effort we put into 
planning the language and defining the terms we use 
will, itself helps instill precision in our minds even before 
we put the results into practise. And the more we attend 
to such preparations, the more we and our intuition 
come to learn about and understand eachother. Our first
step to opening communications lies in finding our pendulum 
'Yes' and 'No' and 'don't know' responses. If you already 
use the pendulum stay with your own method. Never 
change from what already works for you - 'if it aint
broke, don't fix it!'. Readers new to dowsing may like to
follow the startup method given here. Some teachers 
advise you train the pendulum to give specific responses, 
I am from the school prefer if you ask the pendulum for
it's own natural movements in each case instead. 

And so to work! Allow your pendulum (any small weight 
attached to a line) to hang down with three to four inches
of line length, pinched between the thumb and first finger 
of your dominent hand. Begin by consciously swinging it 
toward and away from you, then letting your hand remain 
still so the tool continues to swing on it's own. This is 
called the NEUTRAL or 'ready' position. If the motion 
slows simply swing it consciously again before relaxing 
your hand once more to leave it on it's own. Now, ask
a question in your mind to which you know the answer 
is a definite YES and direct the pendulum mentally to 
show you your YES response. If you observe all this 
passively and relaxed for a time, eventually the 
pendulum will change it's motion 'on it's own' usually 
forming a circle ( either clockwise or anti - clockwise ) 
or swinging to and fro in a different direction to the 
NEUTRAL. This new motion is your YES response 
and once you have agreed it with your pendulum, it will 
always remains the same. Next, stop the pendulum and 
CLEAR it by grasping the line near the suspension point, 
with the thumb and first finger of your 'free hand' and by 
pulling them lightly down along the line, 'stroking the line' 
from top to bottom. You repeat this a few times while 
emptying your mind of previous questions and thoughts. 
When all is clear, you may move on to repeat the same 
questioning procedure again, getting your NO and 
finally your DON'T KNOW responses in the same 
fashion. Remember to CLEAR your pendulum and 
your mind, after each new question you ask. If for some 
reason you find that this exercise is not working out for 
you at your first attempt, leave the pendulum aside and 
start again in a few hours time. Should your pendulum 
continually refuse to provide a 'natural' response for any 
of the three 'answers' then, in this case, you may train it 
to move any way you choose to indicate that particular 
'answer'. This is done by moving the pendulum in the 
desired motion while mentally affirming that this is the 
response you require. This may then be tested by asking 
a question and verifying the pendulum now autonmatically 
adopts the 'learned' response you showed it. Your next 
task is to take your time and write out your definition for 
each term you intend to use in your divining work. For 
instance, if you intend checking for allergies using your 
pendulum, it is vital to agree exactly what you mean by 
'an allergy' to a substance. Do you want the pendulum 
to show up any substance which has ever or will ever 
'disagree' with the person. Are transient 'sensitivities' 
which might last for only a short time, to be included 
in the term also - or will you use a separate term 
( such as the'sensitivity' word itself ) to cover these. 
Give these things a lot of thought, spell them out, refine 
them well so you get them precise and right, for this will 
serve as the foundation for  your future dowsing work. 
Many times when dowsing faculty seems to be unreliable 
the remedy lies in redefining our terms and questions 
correctly. 
The final part of the process is to relax quietly, ask your 
pendulum if it is ready at this time to have you input the
terms and conditions you've settled upon, and provided 
you get a YES response, read the terms aloud as your 
pendulum continues in your YES response. When the 
list is finished, say so, indicating also that these conditions 
are to remain in force without change unless and until you 
modify them by going throught the above procedure 
again. Your pendulum will then return to the NEUTRAL
response pattern. 

When your YES and NO and DON'T KNOW 
responses have been agreed and your TERMS 
and CONDITIONS have been securely input, you 
may move on to train and exercise your new skill 
over the next ten days. Each day sit in a quiet place, 
take out your pendulum, breath deeply and relax 
your body and mind. Ask your pendulum ten 
questions, the answers of which are known to you,
allowing the instrument to reply to you using the 'agreed' 
responses in each case. Exercise for no longer than ten 
minutes on each day. At the end of this ten day program, 
you can proceed to ask the pendulum any questions you 
wish. Providing always that you relax in the correct frame 
of mind,  that your questions are precise complying with 
your agreed terms and conditions - that your intuition has 
access at some level to the information requested - and 
also that receiving such information will be in accordance
with your own personal ethical and moral code, then you 
will be given the answer. Getting a DON'T KNOW 
response indicates that the question as asked, poses a 
problem in some of the areas above. Even when this 
occurs, one can usually ask and determine the precise 
area and reason for the lack of response without much 
difficulty. 

In Part 3 of our series we will explore the important 
issues relating to the use of lists, charts and witnesses.

Section 5   AROMATHERAPY: GETTING STARTED. 
                    By Marge Clark 

I first came in contact with the essential oils perhaps 15 
years ago, as a way to scent potpourri.  Their healing 
power awed and fascinated me from the start. Several 
years of study and experimentation with the essential oils 
followed.  Finally, a few years ago, I was given the 
opportunity to leave behind a lifetime spent in the 
corporate world and do what I love. The founding of 
Nature's Gift Custom Aromatherapy Products followed, 
partially as a way to finance and rationalize my experiencing 
more and higher quality oils, and as a way to share my love 
for them with others. When not dealing with the oils, I am a 
grandmother, live in a small over crowded house with my 
partner, my grown daughter, three dogs and four cats (not 
all mine!)  I have been online for about 12 years and am 
really delighted that the internet gives me a venue to learn 
from others, and to share what I've learned. 
----- 

        Aromatherapy is derived from the ancient practice 
of using natural plant essences to promote health and 
well-being. It consists of the use of pure essential oils 
obtained from a wide assortment of plants, which have 
been steam distilled or cold-pressed from flowers, fruit, 
bark and roots. The appropriate oils can have powerful 
effects, both on the body and the spirit. "Fragrance Oils," 
"Perfumes" and other artificially made substitutes cannot 
produce these amazing results. 

        Modern scientific research has proven the potency 
and healing qualities of pure Essential Oils. Many have 
powerful antibacterial and antiviral qualities which, unlike 
pharmaceutical drugs, do not leave behind dangerous 
toxins. 

    Intrigued? Want to try some of these wonderful oils for 
yourself? My first recommendation would be to educate 
yourself. Put yourself in the hands of someone 
knowledgeable in the field, either locally, if possible, or if 
not, through the library and the Internet. Read everything 
you can about the oils and their effects, and don't be afraid 
to experiment. 

To start with, many of us first tried Lavender. It is an oil 
that can occasionally be used full strength on the skin and 
is a virtual 'first aid' cabinet in and of itself. A touch of 
lavender essential oil on the temples and back of the neck 
can ease a headache. A drop of full strength lavender can 
soothe and help heal a minor burn, bug bite, or skin 
outbreak. It is a potent antiseptic, and an antibacterial, 
antifungal and antiviral agent. 

If you have a local source for true essential oils, use it. Or 
order from online vendors. Check the Latin Name. You 
want either LAVENDULA VERA or L. AUGUSTIFOLIUM, 
L.OFFICINALIS. If it is labled Lavandin it will have different 
properties and not work as expected. 

Now, what to do with it, other than for the " first aid " 
purposes listed above? 

Lavender is lovely in the bath. As with most essentials, 
6 to 10 drops is enough. Rather than adding the oil directly 
to the bathwater (because essentials don't blend with water) 
try diluting the lavender in a tablespoon or so of honey, a 
teaspoon of unscented bath oil, or for a Cleopatra luxury 
bath, some cream. 

Or you can make your own bath salts by mixing Epsom 
salts, sea salt or table salt, and/or powdered milk, and 
adding lavender. Bottle these and let them stand for a week 
or ten days. 

A lavender bath will relax tired muscles and a tired mind. 
It's a wonderful way to relax before bedtime.  Be careful 
not to use too much, however; too much lavender can be 
stimulating, rather than relaxing. 

To induce restful sleep, put a few drops of lavender on a 
cotton ball or tissue and tuck it into the corner of your 
pillow case.Ten drops of lavender to one half ounce of 
your favorite carrier oil makes a wonderfully relaxing 
massage oil.  The same massage blend, with an appropriate 
facial oil, could be a valuable part of your skin care routine. 

The above are just a few hints to get you started. 
Coming next month: 
using Essential Oils safely.
