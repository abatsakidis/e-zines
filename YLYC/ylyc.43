Welcome to the last Your Life-Your Choice issue of 1999! 
Everyone is so busy this time of year, that we are using 
this issue to bring you up to speed on our new millenium 
plans.

We have exciting news to share with you for the upcoming 
year. We've talked before about new services coming on 
board like online seminars with certified practitioners 
as guest hosts, and a place to bring your questions online, 
and up to date newsfeeds. Well... it's finally HERE! 
Your Life-Your Choice will be starting the new millenium 
with a Membership Program designed especially for YOU! 
And as you grow, the program will also continue to grow 
with you to suit your needs.

Immediately you will be able to access the Your Life-Your 
Choice Alternative Medicine Message Board. Here you can 
discuss alternative medicine issues with other members. 
Ask your questions and receive input from both professionals 
and people who have had similar experiences. This board 
will be moderated for your protection and enjoyment.

You will see current information in the form of newsfeeds 
provided by various alternative medicine governing agencies.
You will know right away what's happening; new discoveries, 
study results, cautions, and much more. You'll hear it all 
directly from the organizations that govern each modality 
and certify the practitioners. Each one has their own 
code of ethics which must be adhered to in order to ensure 
quality within that sector.

Online seminars will be offered every other month to begin 
with. It's possible that they may be offered on a monthly 
basis in the future. Our first one will be held the last 
week in January! Ask your questions directly to the guest 
practitioner... and get an immediate answer! Further 
details to follow.

Very soon Health reports will be available. These reports 
will be just the way you like them... they will address 
specific health issues and will give some suggestions as 
to what options are available to you for a solution. There 
will only be a few to start, but it will build into a 
significant library as we discover where your interests 
lie.

In the future you can expect to see additional message 
boards for the purpose of support groups. As we reach  
enough people who share the same health concerns; perhaps 
Cancer, AIDS, ADD/ADHD and many other health issues, we 
will open a new message board dedicated to that topic. 
This way those who share in that concern can either give 
or receive advice on how to deal with it. This will be 
an excellent support vehicle for those who suffer from 
a health condition or someone who is trying to help a 
loved one who is suffering from a specific condition. 

You can also look forward to seeing monthly reviews on 
alternative medicine books, websites, resorts, etc. This 
can save you hundreds of dollars by guiding you to 
information that is useful, rather than spending money 
on poorly written, hard to understand books or resources.

And this is just the beginning! We have many more ideas 
on a going forward basis, and we expect to continue 
hearing from you about what you'd like to see.

All of this and more awaits you in the new Your Life-Your 
Choice Membership Program! This program will launch on
January 3, 2000. This entire program has an annual value 
that exceeds $1,000. The regular price for this program 
is $99 for our one year membership. READ ON for special 
savings exclusively for Your Life-Your Choice subscribers.
