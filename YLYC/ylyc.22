====================                               issue 22 

                        Letter from the Editor 

	HAPPY NEW YEAR! I hope everyone has started this 
year with motivation and determination. This is the time 
to make some positive changes in our lives, and Your Life-
Your Choice will be here to help you out.

	A good number of our friends overseas are celebrating 
special events this month. January is still a celebration 
month for many religions and cultures. Many have enjoyed 
their Christmas festivities this past week. Pueto Rico 
celebrates Three Kings Day, and many countries celebrate 
the Ephiphany. Venezuela has a ceremony for Paradura Del 
Nino, Malaysia celebrates Hari Raya, Israel celebrates 
Tu Bi'shevat and Iceland says goodbye to their 13th Santa 
during Threttandinn. Thaipusam and Ramadan are also celebrated 
during this time. Happy Holidays to all of you. 

    Until next time Your Life-Your Choice wishes you 
health and prosperity.

Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

5 years ago I had a difficult decision to make. My vision
was so poor that corrective lenses were no longer helpful.
My opthalmologist suggested that I have surgery since there 
was no hope of my eyes correcting themselves. After asking 
a lot of questions, I agreed to have major surgery on both 
my eyes. The surgery required many cuts with a Diamond tip 
scalpel. 

One eye healed with tremendous success. The other 
did not. I have since had 5 more surgeries to remove the 
scar tissue and white haze which always returned and covered 
my pupil. I have had no vision in that eye now for 5 years.
The surgeries are painful, and I finally decided no more. 

I was introduced to an herbal grape seed extract. After being 
on the product for 5 weeks I started to see! I ran into the 
bathroom and looked into the mirror because I couldn't believe 
that the continuous haze I had was leaving. My roommate couldn't
believe the difference! She said there was still a small trace, 
but no where near the blockage that had been so obvious before.
After 2 more weeks there was no hazing at all!

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

NO PAIN AFTER WORKING OUT!
Four years ago, this forty-something (at the time) was 
given the gift of three sessions a week for six weeks.  
"Harry", the trainer, had the reputation of being able 
to do total body makeovers in six weeks. He guaranteed 
you would have no pain if you EXACTLY followed his 
instructions.

I only had one time when I experienced any pain. That 
one morning, after working out the previous day, I could 
hardly move. I HAD NOT REMEMBERED TO TAKE THE 2000MG OF 
VITAMIN C RIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME!  Harry said the extra C
right before sleeping helped the body heal overnight. It 
works after most any kind of unusual strenuous activity 
as well.

----------

	This is the fourth and last of a series of articles 
designed to be used as a resource or a starting ground in 
determining which alternative/complementary treatment will 
benefit you. Although there are many therapies not addressed, 
you'll find most of the commonly recognized modalities briefly 
described here. Remember, this is a brief description. Often 
we will not be able to do justice to the therapy in question 
in such a limited amount of space. This resource is meant to 
educate you as to the numerous options available. YOU are the 
one who is empowered to take control over your health on a 
going forward basis. Remember, too, that the onus is upon the 
individual to ensure that the practitioner you choose is 
properly qualified and possesses the required certification 
for your area.



Polarity Therapy - According to this principle, a body 
generates both positive and negative energy. Constant 
pulsation from these areas creates energetic lines of 
force... a life energy. Disease occurs when the life 
energy is blocked or out of balance. Typically, too 
much positivity is associated with heat, inflammation, 
irritation and swelling. Too much negative energy is 
associated with tension, spasm, and poor circulation. 

To address these health concerns Polarity Therapy has 
four inter-related therapeutic methods:

Bodywork:  Through gentle touch, the practitioner's 
		hands assist the flow of healing energy 
		in the client's body.

Diet:      Advice on diet and nutrition is given 
		promoting the use of specific dietary 
		principles for internal cleansing.

Exercise:  A specific set of exercises referred to as 
		Polarity Yoga. This series of or self-help 
		energy techniques create relaxation and 
		balance.

Self-Awareness:  Learn to understand the sources of your 
		tension and discover ways to maintain your 
		health.

It is this combination approach and a different energy theory 
which differentiates Polarity Therapy from other similar forms. 


Pranic Healing - Pranic Healing utilizes the life force to 
initiate biochemical changes to allow the body to heal itself. 
Pranic Healing claims to prevent and heal  a whole spectrum of 
physical, emotional and mental ailments using a "no-touch" 
methodology. Because the methods are simple and easy to 
understand, anyone can learn to apply pranic healing.



Reiki - Reiki is a non-invasive hands on healing technique 
which uses the Universal Life-Force Energy to heal. The 
subject plays an active role in the healing process using 
the practitioner to channel positive, healing energy. Reiki 
is said to be helpful on spiritual, mental, emotional and 
physical levels. 


Rolfing- Rolfing was named after its' creator, Ida P. Rolf, 
a biochemist and physical therapist. 
She claims to have found a correlation between muscular 
tension and pent up emotions. Dr. Rolf developed a deep 
tissue massage which surpasses chiropractic in that it is 
based on proper alignment beyond that of the spine. The 
belief is that you must align your head, ankles, hips, 
thorax, pelvis, knees, shoulders, ears, etc., in a specific 
manner or poor physical and/or emotional health will result. 


Reflexology - This treatment is based on the principle that 
there are reflex areas formed by thousands of nerve endings 
in each hand and foot which also correspond to all other 
organs and glands. Proper stimulation of these reflexes is 
a natural way of relieving dis-ease throughout the body and 
maintaining good health. This is a safe, effective, reliable 
process; a non-invasive therapy which can help bring about a 
balance in the body's systems. Especially beneficial in 
dealing with stress, circulation, TMJ, migraines, constipation, 
toxic overload, indigestion, PMS and menstrual concerns, 
allergies, asthma, colds, arthritis, bladder concerns and 
much more.


Shiatsu -  Similar to Acupressure, Shiatsu promotes health 
and vitality by balancing the circulation of vital energy 
which flowing throughout the body along pathways. During a 
theraputic massage, the practitioner applies pressure to 
specific meridian points. This pressure stimulates and 
rebalances the energy flow. In addition, gentle stretching 
techniques are used to release tension from the body and 
improve flexibility. Shiatsu may be of particular benefit 
to conditions such as back pain, migraine, headache, 
toothache, digestive problems, tension, insomnia, anxiety. 


This concludes the therapies that we've covered in this 
series. I hope it's been helpful for you. Take control, 
be empowered, and stay healthy.

Section 5   	What the cosmetic companies really offer you. 
				Part Two

			By LaNita Wampold 
			mailto:LaNita@LaNita.com

 "My Skin Care Product's Ingredients SOUND Natural"?   

The ingredient lists may be impressive with substances 
beneficial to skin and hair, such as jojoba oil, aloe vera, 
herbal extracts, essential oils. These ingredients are 
unfortunately rendered useless and ineffective by 
synthetic additives.  

To speak further about ingredients in shampoos, shower gels, 
bubbling bath additives, and toothpastes brings us to the 
foaming agents used within them. The foam attacks and 
destroys the skin flora, and the skin becomes even more 
brittle and dry. This is made apparent by the itching that 
then must be relieved with a moisturizing lotion or cream. 
To compensate for this negative effect manufacturers add 
oils or fats to replace those lost due to the active 
cleansing substances. The question then becomes: Why are 
such aggressive substances used to begin with? The answer 
is: Because "Squeaky Clean", is what advertising has 
proclaimed for decades as being of utmost importance.   

The same consequences apply to the chemical dyes and fragrances 
contained  in many products. Since synthetic cosmetics don't have 
a pleasing color or  smell, they must be "doctored" to appeal to 
the eye and nose of the consumer; thus the addition of further 
chemicals to mask the base ingredients. Also, the production of 
an emulsifier from water and oil--the  basis of almost all creams, 
lotions, and shampoos-- is possible only with an emulsifying agent 
or thickener. 

Because of their cost, natural emulsifying agents and thickeners 
are not used. The chemical emulsifying agents that are used 
instead impair the effectiveness of the natural substances or 
attack the flora. The problem is even more serious in lipsticks. 
The thin, unprotected skin of the mouth is directly affected by 
dyes, which enter into the body and affect the metabolism. 
Similarly, mascaras, eye shadows, and eyeliners contain heavy 
metals and chemical dyes that penetrate the skin. These metals and
dyes are stored on a long-term basis in the body, and poison it.   

"My Skin Care Says It Will Reverse Wrinkles":   

Among the above list are the moisturizing creams and lotions 
made of water and mineral oils that "provide" the upper 
layer of the skin with moisture for some hours and then 
puzzelingly cause it to dry out. Anti-wrinkle or anti- aging 
creams that temporarily cause the surface skin to swell, are
very popular. The skin looks smooth, fresh and younger for 
several hours, but soon falls back into its old condition.   

These "wonder drug" substances the creams contain--collagen,  
elastin, and the like--smooth the skin and give a temporary 
impression of improvement--until the next time the face is 
washed. In fact, once the natural collagen and elastin in the  
connective tissue has attained an age-appropriate, hardened  
condition wrinkles cannot be "ironed-out". What is possible 
at this time is to stimulate the formation of new skin cells 
and to discourage the further loss of moisture.   

Many cosmetics have promised "wondrous" effects and have been 
offered over the past  few decades: liposome, vitamins, collagen,
elastin, and hormones. Yet the  condition of people's skin has 
not improved. The consumer increasingly suffers from eczema, 
itching and irritations of the skin, dryness, extreme oiliness, 
and damaged skin flora--symptoms that are widely influenced by 
aggressive, synthetic cleansing and skin care agents.   

What about "Hypo-allergenic"?  

Finally, let me speak about the promise of hypo-allergenic 
products offered on the market. "Allergy-tested" means only 
that the product was tested, it does not tell us what the 
tests results were. The very fact that it had to be tested 
should be enough to cause concern.   

It is widely known that the tests conducted by cosmetic 
manufacturers are based on animal experiments that take the 
life of over one  hundred million animals a year. The animals 
are injected or forced to ingest substances, or have substances 
sprayed into their eyes or applied to their skin.   

Even the "positive results" obtained by this testing cannot 
guarantee cosmetics without side effects. As consumers, we 
are not told that the "positive" results were extremely 
positive or merely barely tolerable. Often the long-term 
effect of some toxic or carcinogenic substance in a cosmetic 
product is discovered only after many years.
