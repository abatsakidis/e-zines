====================                        issue 13

                  Letter from the Editor

    Together again for another Your Life-Your Choice 
health issue. This issue covers an area that touches 
millions of families... 
I'm pleased to introduce to you Joe Carr, who will be 
hosting our Nutritional Column.

	Welcome, Joe, to Your Life-Your Choice; and I 
thank you for launching this column with a series on 
ADD/ADHD.

	To compliment this series Howie Thomason  R.N.C
will be offering nutritious meals perfect for the person 
facing this challenge. This is particularly timely in 
that the begining of a new school year is upon us and 
new lunch suggestions are ALWAYS welcome! 
	Thank you Howie Thomason. Be sure to read both 
of their bios which accompany their contributions. 

	There is one more TERRIFIC news flash to share with 
you. In the past I have had subscribers email me asking 
if I knew of a certified practitioner in their immediate 
area. Unfortunately, unless there's been someone listed 
in our Wellness Locator, I've not been able to help them...
Until now! After a considerable amount of researching and 
networking Your Life-Your Choice has several vehicles in 
place to assist you in locating a practitioner in your 
area. Within the next few days there will be a form located 
at the Newsletter Headquarters that you may fill out 
indicating your location and the specific modality (type of 
alternative medicine/treatment) you're searching for. I will 
exhaust my network trying to find someone either in your 
immediate area or as close to it as possible. The names and 
contact information of the practitioners will be forwarded 
to you, and YOU will choose which one/ones you'd like to 
contact. Your Life-Your Choice WILL NOT reveal your identity.

The best part of all of this is.... IT'S FREE!!!! All I ask 
is that when you make contact with a practitioner, you tell 
them that you got their name from Your Life-Your Choice.

So until the form is ready, if you're looking for help, you 
can mailto:yourlife@life-choices.com. Put "Looking For 
Practitioner" in the subject heading. Include your 
Name:
City:
State/Province:
Country
Type of Modality Your Looking for: (Herbologist, Acupuncturist, 
etc.)

    Until next time Your Life-Your Choice wishes you
health and prosperity.

Section 2            The Dilemma of ADD/ADHD
			By Joe Carr, Ph.D., C.N.C.

If we were to refer to a modern day affliction that affected 
more than 2 million people we would probably call it an 
epidemic. If we were to examine statistics of an illness from 
30 years ago, compare those numbers to the numbers from today 
for the same problem and see more than a thousand-fold
increase in less than the span of a generation, we would 
probably become alarmed. However, instead of doing either of 
the above we seem to be content to merely label it as 
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). 

ADD is a psychiatric diagnostic label. Defined in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
the core diagnostic manual of the psychiatric profession, 
a child's "overall" behavior is required to be evaluated. 
The evaluation is supposed to be based in part on 
observations of the child's family members and other 
adults, especially teachers, who have routine contact with 
the child. 

Once called hyperkinesis or minimal brain dysfunction, ADD 
is one of the most common mental disorders among children. 
Statistics range from 3 to 5+ percent of all children, 2 
million+ children in the U.S. alone with the problem. The 
disorder is two to three times more common in boys than 
girls. If you were to poll the nation's schools you would 
discover that at least one in every classroom in the U.S. 
has been diagnosed or is suspected of having ADD. The 
disorder doesn't stop with adolescence. It often continues 
into the adult years and causes a lifetime of frustrated 
dreams and emotional pain.

In my practice as a nutritional counselor and psychologist 
I deal with parents, their children, and other adults with 
ADD, from all walks of life that are trying to cope with 
the demands that this "ailment" has laid at their doorsteps. 
Unfortunately, many of the problems associated with the 
"disorder" (and I do object to labeling this problem as a 
disorder, but, for the sake of simplicity I will do so) 
are of a social nature rather than a physical one. Often 
the frustrations of having to deal with teachers, school, 
peers, spouses and the society at large is more difficult 
than dealing with the demands of the disorder. As a father 
of a son diagnosed at age 6 as ADD and who has "been there, 
done that," I am intimately familiar with the stigma and 
maddening frustration associated with ADD/ADHD. I can 
testify to the strains it places on the family and the 
mental havoc it causes among the other family members who 
find that it is not "fair" or "just" that their family 
should be so afflicted. More than one family has been torn 
apart by these strains on the family bond.

Over the next few months we will be exploring some of the 
facts and fictions associated with ADD/ADHD (and again, 
for the sake of simplicity, I'll use the ADD designation 
to refer to both issues). Perhaps of more interest to those
parents with children who are diagnosed ADD, we will explore 
some of the "other" avenues available to us for treating or
controlling the symptomology that is so bothersome for us, 
our children and the society in which they have to interact.

Next month we will look at what is NOT ADD (though often 
diagnosed as ADD), an understanding of the cause of ADD 
and some of the drug treatments, and their side effects, 
that are employed.

Section 3   RIGHT AND WRONG MAGNETIC THERAPY
      PRACTICES and Pointers That Will Improve Your Results.

				(Part II)


       This report is written by Boyce N. Berkel, M.D.
It was condensed and adapted by permission from
Dr. William H. Philpotts book "Critical Review of
Currently Practiced Magnetic Therapy." Dr. Philpott
is currently doing FDA approved research in Magnetic
Therapy, and is taking applications. For more information
on this timely and very fascinating subject, go to
http://www.uniquenterprises.com/magnets

                              --------------------

Last month you learned about the counter-irritant response. 
You learned that the positive magnetic and the mixed 
positive and negative magnetic fields produce their effects 
using this principle. You also learned that the counter-
irritant response fatigues, leading to the recurrence of 
symptoms. None of this occurs with exposure to a negative 
magnetic field.

Today you will find out the effects of prolonged exposure 
to the positive magnetic field and why it is not generally 
recommended. You will also find out why the negative magnetic 
field exposure is recommended to treat injuries, infections, 
inflammation, edema, neoplasms, and to restore energy.

It is a well known fact that the application of a positive 
magnetic field, or a mixed positive-negative magnetic field 
are useful modalities in relieving pain, but no better than 
a negative magnetic field only. However they have some severe 
limitations as to duration of application due to the counter-
irritant response. Most unfortunate of all is that if this 
positive magnetic field is used with repeated frequency, 
particularly around the head, it can raise self-made narcotics 
(endorphins) and produce addiction. This is one of the most 
serious side effects.

Other effects of prolonged EXPOSURE TO A POSITIVE MAGNETIC 
FIELD or a mixed positive-negative magnetic field are 1) The 
development of abnormal acidity in your cells and tissues. 
This leads to the degenerative changes that predispose to 
chronic diseases and aging. 2) The development of a low 
oxygen state in your cells and tissues. 3) The development 
of latent bacterial, viral and fungal infections. 4) In 
biologically predisposed persons, it leads to depression 
and other major and minor mental and emotional reactions.

There are however non-reflex uses of a positive magnetic 
field. The positive magnetic field will excite nerves to 
function. If a person has received an injury to the spine, 
or there is pressure on the spinal chord; such as from a 
tumor or multiple sclerosis, in which the cells are suffering 
the effects of disuse, and have not been destroyed, you can 
place a positive magnetic field over the area, and have that 
person practice using those muscles or other functions to 
which the affected nerves relate.

For instance, a person may be dragging his foot. But when 
the positive magnetic field is placed over the spine, he 
can walk without dragging the foot. With practice he could 
learn to walk again.

The positive magnetic field may also be used to excite the 
production of adrenocortical hormones. This is helpful if 
you need a spurt of energy at the beginning of the day. 
Treat the adrenal glands for no longer than three to five 
minutes with the positive magnetic field in the morning, 
and then also treat them again for 30 minutes in the 
evening with the negative magnetic field.

Here are the effects from EXPOSURE TO A NEGATIVE MAGNETIC 
FIELD. 1) You experience increase oxygenation of your cells 
and tissues. This makes for improved metabolism, and 
improved health. 2) You are better able to resist and 
fight off infections by bacteria, viruses and parasites. 
3) There is less of a tendency to retain fluid (edema), 
both intercellular (inside the cells) and extracellular 
(outside the cells). 4) Inflammation, whatever its cause 
(bee sting, infection, chronic irritation), is reduced. 
This of course relieves the pain, and facilitates healing. 
5) Encourages healing by pulling oxygen and nutritional 
fluids into the affected area. 6) Helps you to get sound 
energy-restoring sleep, thus giving you a more productive 
day. 7) Normalizes your acid-base balance (alkalinizing 
the cells and tissues). This relieves symptoms caused by 
acidic conditions such as allergies, toxic states, acid 
indigestion, sore/stiff muscles, and many diseased states. 
8) Increases mental acuity, and calms the electrically 
overcharged brain, relieving hyperactivity, behavioral 
problems, obsessive-compulsiveness and other problems. 
9) Relieves and stops pain, soreness and other symptoms. 
10) Helps to reduce the fat and calcium deposits in your 
arteries, reducing your risk of heart attack or other 
cardiac problems. 11) Slowly helps to dissolve and reduce 
fatty deposits.

No adverse side effects have been observed with negative 
field energy. Since negative magnetic energy pulls fluid 
into an enclosed area, pain can develop from increased 
pressure in a joint or encapsulated area (kneecap, sinuses, 
eyeball etc.).  Should this happen, the magnet should be 
moved in position, but not necessarily removed. By moving 
the magnet above, below or aside the painful site 2-3 
inches, fluid will be pulled away from the affected area, 
relieving the pain. 

Persons on medication (prescription drugs, thyroid etc.) 
may develop symptoms of overmedication when using the over 
all body treatment (magnetic bed). As stress and 
inflammation are reduced in the body, toxins are released 
and metabolism improves. Drugs can become more effective, 
and may have to be reduced or discontinued as body 
chemistry changes. Consult your doctor for monitoring if 
symptoms occur.

To sum it all up, all injured and many diseased tissues are 
measurably magnetic positive. Positive magnetic field energy 
interferes with healing, and also drives abnormal cell 
division and promotes the growth of microorganisms. The use 
of a positive magnetic field or a combined positive and 
negative magnetic field is unsuited to treat degenerative 
diseases because of the fact that when the stress reflex 
fatigues (counter-irritant reflex or adaptation) and symptoms 
re-emerge, the chronic illness is reinforced.

Negative magnetic energy is the energy that heals, alkalinizes 
(which is the normal state of your cells and tissues), 
oxygenates and normalizes cellular metabolism. It therefore is 
a major contributor to correcting disordered metabolism, and 
improving the quality of your life. Since a negative magnetic 
field is not a stress field, it has no stress reflex (counter-
irritant reflex), and has no time limitation.

PRECAUTIONS	

DO NOT use magnets on the abdomen during PREGNANCY
DO NOT use a magnetic bed or magnets on your chest if wearing 
	a PACEMAKER or DEFIBRILLATOR. A magnet within a few 
	inches of these instruments can interrupt their function.
DO NOT use a magnetic bed for 24 hours daily if ill. This could 
	suppress your adrenal glands, resulting in slow energy 
	recovery. The magnetic bed may be used 8 - 10 hours per 
	day, and then supplemented with spot therapy for specific 
	symptoms.
DO NOT use magnets on the abdomen for 60 - 90 minutes following 
	meals. This allows peristalsis to take place.
DO NOT use positive magnetic energy on a prolonged basis unless 
	under medical supervision.

Section 4     YOUR LIFE-YOUR CHOICE RECIPE CORNER

		Recipe for ADD/ADHD Children. 
		  By Howie Thomason  R.N.C.


For the child with ADD/ADHD it is very important to avoid 
sugars in the many forms seen in todays foods. Dextrose,  
corn sweetener, corn syrup, fructose, and honey are the 
common forms you will see on the food labels. 

It is also very important to avoid food additives. This is 
a very broad category as there are at least five thousand 
food additives used in the United States. Some of these will 
be seen as Calcium silicate; (anti-caking agent),  BHT and 
BHA; (anti-oxidants), Benzoyl Peroxide; (bleaching agent), 
Artificial azo dye derivatives; (colourings), Benzoates, 
Nitrates, sulfites; (Preservatives), and the list goes on.  

These are just a few of the many things we would like to 
avoid in the diet.  

A diet high in essential fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, 
and enzymes is very important when dealing with the 
hyperactive child. 

The following recipe is high in usable minerals, vitamin C 
to aid in mineral absorption, and high in foods that 
stimulate HCL (hydrochloric acid) and enzyme activity. 


THE SUPER BOWL
