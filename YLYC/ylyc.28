----------

The 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet is presented in a 3-part 
series. In part one you found out the physiologic basis for 
the diet. Last month in part two you  found out specifically 
what the diet consists of, and how you can use it. Today in 
conclusion of part three you will find out how to manage food 
and other addictions that play such a major role in the 
development of degenerative diseases. 


This completes the series on the 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MAGNETIC PROTOCOL FOR ADDICTION

ORIENTATION:

This magnetic protocol applies to addiction to exogenous 
narcotics as well as addiction to endogenous opiate-polypeptides 
(endorphins) evoked by frequently eaten food stressors or 
frequently used chemical stressors such as alcohol, tobacco, 
caffeine, amphetamines and so forth. Addiction to gambling can 
be handled by the same magnetic method. 

It is highly important that all addictions be handled at the 
same time. Peace-meal resolution of addiction simply extends 
the misery and the person is likely never to complete the job. 
The person abandons any and all exogenous narcotics and stops 
all chemical stressors such as alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and 
amphetamines and goes on a five day use of only foods used 
less than two times a week. This also applies to the entire 
family of any foods eaten two times a week or more. 

Gluten containing foods are to be left out of the diet if any 
of them have been used twice a week or more. These are wheat, 
rye, oats, barley and corn. A four day rotation diet based on 
food families is introduced and maintained as a lifestyle. 

In six weeks, start re-introducing the frequently used foods 
back into the rotation diet. Dairy products and gluten 
containing foods are best to leave out for a twelve week 
period before introducing them back into the diet.

If need be, magnets can be used pre-meal to prevent symptom 
production from food. This can be used where there are few 
foods tolerated.

PLACEMENT AND DURATION:

Symptoms can be relieved by placing ceramic disc magnets 
bitemporally. That is, in the front of the ear near the top 
of the ears. Hold these in place with a 2 x 26 inch band. 

Place a 4 x 6 x 1/2 inch magnet on the mid-sternum. This can 
be held in place with a 4 x 52 inch body wrap around the chest. 
This magnet on the sternum is placed lengthwise the body. 

Below the rib cage directly over the epigastric area, place 
crosswise the body a 4 x 6x l/2 inch magnet. This can be held 
in place with a 4 x 52 inch body wrap. 

These magnets are to be in place whenever symptoms occur. 
Symptoms will usually leave within ten minutes. However, for 
some it may take up to thirty minutes. It would be ideal for 
the person to be laying down or in a reclining chair. If 
laying down in a reclining chair there is no need to place a 
body wrap around either the chest or the epigastric area. 

There is no restriction as to the duration of leaving the 
magnets on the body. The more, the better. Many people will 
choose, for ambulatory reasons, simply to use the magnets 
whenever symptoms occur. It is easy however, to leave the 
magnets on the head continuously, if desired. 

It is necessary to remove the magnet from the epigastric area 
when eating a meal and should not be replaced for at least an 
hour after the meal. If however, there are some symptoms that 
develop in the epigastric area, it could be replaced until the 
symptom is relieved and then removed. The reason for removing 
the magnet from the epigastric area is that these muscles are 
silent while the magnet is there and the food will not move 
from the stomach into the intestines. It is important also, 
to not have a magnet over the right side of the body on the 
front for an hour to an hour and one-half after a meal. If any 
symptoms develop in any part of the abdomen, the magnet could 
be used long enough to relieve the symptoms and then removed 
allowing for the movement of food through the intestinal tract. 

The magnets on the head are usually placed bitemporally, however, 
some people find more relief if they place a magnet on the 
mid-forehead and one on the left temporal area. This is best for 
anxiety and tension. For obsessive-compulsiveness, more relief 
may be obtained by using the left temporal and low occipital area. 
Some even find it better instead of a disc magnet on the occipital 
area, to place a 4 x 6 x 1/2 inch magnet on the occipital area and 
to lean back against this if in a reclining chair or on the back 
of the head if laying down.

It is advised that you start the food avoidance immediately when 
handling any other addictions. The foods that are avoided are the 
ones that you used twice a week or more. Other foods can be eaten. 
Sometimes it is quite comfortable for the first five days of this 
avoidance period to use a watermelon fast, but only if it is 
watermelon season. In any event, use only foods that are infrequently 
used. This provides a withdrawal from food addiction. After this five 
days of avoidance, if foods were introduced to which you were addicted, 
there would be an acute symptom production within one hour of exposure 
to the food. A practical way is to not introduce these foods for at 
least six weeks and if these were very frequently used foods, such as 
daily, it would be best especially for cereal grains containing gluten 
and dairy products to not be introduced for twelve weeks. 

However, after six weeks a trial could be made of introducing into the 
meal or even having a single meal of a food that had been frequently 
eaten to determine if it now does not produce symptoms. If it does not, 
it can be introduced back into the diet if kept in rotation as a lifestyle. 

This is the description of the minimal program. Addiction for water 
soluble substances is over in five days. However, fat soluble substances 
such as nicotine from tobacco requires 21 days to leach out of the cells. 
Therefore, symptoms may be emerging for as much as 21 days in tobacco 
addiction. 

Tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine should never be introduced back into the 
diet, even on rotation. Even though rotation would make it less likely 
for symptoms to occur, but for optimum health they should not be 
introduced back into the diet.

WEIGHT MANAGEMENT	

Body weight beyond physiological normal is often caused by the urge to 
overeat due to food addiction. Overeating is a compulsive habit, no 
matter what it's psychological or biological driving force. In any event, 
magnetic therapy plus calorie reduction can materially help in weight 
reduction.

Magnetic discs placed bitemporally reduce the electrical excitement 
of the brain, and can handle habit urges whether psychological or 
physiological. This makes it easier for you to stick with a calorie 
reduction program.

A 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet is a must in weight management. This 
will stop food addiction, and make it a whole lot easier to stick with 
your calorie reduction program.

If you place a negative magnetic field over a fat area, it will gradually 
reduce the fat area. This magnetic reduction occurs only at night while 
you sleep. A negative magnet activates growth hormone's ability to allow 
fat cells to release their fat. Growth hormone rises only at night while 
you sleep. Please note that this magnetic fat reduction will have little 
effect in maintaining your weight reduction, without also associating it 
with calorie reduction.

STRESS MANAGEMENT

Addiction is both a biological and psychological stress. Therefore, 
magnetically managed addiction has been described in this article under 
addiction management.

Biological responses to psychological stress can be handled magnetically 
by treating the brain with a negative magnetic field, and also treating 
magnetically any body areas responding symptomatically to the psychological 
stress.

Frequently used foods as stressors deserve special consideration

Serotonin is evoked by both biological and psychological stress as a 
readiness for needed action. Stress also evokes endorphins in a readiness 
for action and potential injury. This rise in endorphins under stress-injury 
buffers against pain. Thus, stress and potential injury raises simultaneously 
serotonin and self-made opiates.

First of all, magnetically handle addiction since addiction is a major 
stressor. Do not use a food to raise the serotonin-opiate complex as this 
either is addiction or will soon become addiction. 

Use a negative magnetic field to relieve the symptoms. Sleeping at night 
in a negative magnetic field will normalize the serotonin and opiate balance. 
Symptoms can be relieved within ten to thirty minutes with a negative 
magnetic field appropriately placed on the head and the symptom area. 
This magnetic treatment normalizes biological function and never leads 
to addiction or any side effects.

THE FINAL WORD

Addiction leads to degenerative diseases, especially maturity onset 
diabetes mellitus. Food addiction is very real and the most frequent 
addiction. A 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet is optimal to prevent 
and or reverse food addiction. Do not use food as a symptom reliever 
or for weight management such as has been advised. The weight reduction 
medications using the serotonin-opiate complex produced so many symptoms, 
they have been withdrawn from the market. The tranquilizer-antidepressants 
using a method of raising the serotonin-opiate complex produce serious, 
devastating side effect symptoms and therefore, cannot be recommended. 
A negative magnetic field properly placed relieves symptoms, produces 
melatonin, produces normal energy restoring sleep and normalizes the 
serotonin-opiate ratio and has no side effects. A negative magnetic 
field associated with a non-addictive state is markedly superior to 
tranquilizers, antidepressants and weight management medications.

WARNING:
The system described in this write-up uses the negative magnetic 
pole field only. The positive magnetic field or the mixed positive-
negative magnetic fields will not achieve the necessary results. A 
negative magnetic field calms neurons and normalizes biological 
functions. A negative magnetic field does not evoke the production 
of serotonin or endorphins. 

A negative magnetic field has a biological response of alkaline-
hyperoxia. A negative magnetic field activates oxidoreductase enzymes 
that process free radicals, peroxides, acids, alcohols and aldehydes 
and releases oxygen which is bound in these substances thus making 
oxygen available for producing ATP in the oxidation phosphorylation 
process.

A positive magnetic field, whether singly or mixed with a negative 
magnetic field, excites neurons, produces acid-hypoxia, and blocks 
oxidoreductase enzyme function. The positive magnetic field on the 
heart increases the pulse rate and can evoke tachycardia in a subject 
predisposed to tachycardia. A positive magnetic field excites neurons 
and can evoke a seizure in a subject predisposed to seizures. A positive 
magnetic field evokes the production of serotonin and endorphins and for
this reason can produce magnetic addiction. Positive magnetic field 
addiction produces pleasurable euphoria, disorders judgement, and has a 
painful withdrawal phase. Positive magnetic field addiction can lead to 
the frequent use of the magnet to relieve pain and when used on the head 
can be misused to produce pleasurable euphoria. A positive magnetic field 
addiction is a true addiction with all the features of addiction.

My reason for presenting this subject of a positive magnetic field 
addiction is because there are magnets marketed-for pain that use both 
positive and negative pole fields. These are not suitable for treatment 
of addiction, weight management or for stress management.

Complete details and specifics of the 4-Day Rotation Diet; which magnets 
to use and how to apply them are described in Volume IV, First Quarter 
1998 - Magnetic Management of Addiction.

Section 4   		 	Nutrition For Seniors
			The Importance of good digestion
		
			    By Howie M. Thomason RNCP

	Read about Howie Thomason on our Meet the Team page; 
		http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html

----------

The old adage; ³You are what you eat² may not always be true.  
Maybe it should be ³You are what you digest and assimilate².

With seniors, even a healthful diet of fresh natural foods may 
not be enough. As we age our digestive systems may not work as 
efficiently as they once did. The production of Hydrochloric 
acid (HCL) by the parietal cells in the stomach can decrease to 
half of what it was in our youth by the age of forty. This 
hydrochloric acid is needed to convert pepsinogen into pepsin, 
an active proteolytic (protein digesting) enzyme. The result
can be poor digestion of proteins and minerals such as calcium 
and iron.

It doesn¹t end there though. The contents of the stomach need to 
be acidic in nature when they pass through the pyloric valve and 
into the duodenum, the beginning of the intestinal tract. It is 
this acidic nature that stimulates the release of  alkaline 
pancreatin from the pancreas. The pancreatin contains enzymes for 
the digestion of fats, (lipase), carbohydrates, (amylase), and 
proteins, (protease). These continue the digestion started by the 
mouth and the stomach.

Digestion can go on reasonably well without proper stomach function 
due to the pancreas doing most of the work. Does it matter if the 
pancreas does the digestion rather than the mouth and the stomach? 
Yes! It puts too much of the work load on the pancreas. If digestion 
is sluggish, toxins are produced and foods are not broken down 
completely. This can be one of the causes of food intolerance and 
allergy. This can be the beginning of dis-ease.  When digestion is 
quickened and made more complete, the body immediately reactivates 
its healing powers.

The food moves down the duodenum into the rest of the small intestine
which is about twenty feet long. The walls secrete more alkaline
digestive enzymes which continue the breaking down of proteins into 
amino acids, long fatty chains into fatty acids, and starches and 
complex sugars into glucose. The fats are carried away by lymph vessels 
and veins pick up other digested nutrients. The veins gradually join 
together to form the portal vein, which goes directly to the liver. If 
digestion is not complete at this stage, and there is tissue injury to 
the intestine, foods that are not completely digested can be transported 
to the liver. This is the beginning of food intolerance and food allergy. 
This also becomes a burden on the liver. The fats are picked up by the 
lymph system because too much fat interferes with both liver and red 
blood cell function.

At the end of the small intestine is a circular valve called the
ileocecal valve. This stays closed so the food stays in the small
intestine long enough to be digested and absorbed fully, and also to
prevent the micro-organisms in the large intestine from getting into 
the small intestine where their waste products could easily be absorbed. 
As digestion and absorption are completed the ileocecal valve opens and 
the rhythmic waves of contraction called peristalsis move the food into 
the cecum, which is the beginning of the five foot long large intestine 
or colon.

The large intestine is populated with over four hundred different types
of micro-organisms which collectively are called the intestinal flora.
Most of them are our friends and are very important aids to the digestive
process.
They make B vitamins, lactic acid, which improves digestion of foods and
aids with peristalsis, and vitamin K, which aids in blood clotting, among
other things.
An imbalance of these bacteria is known as Dysbiosis, and can be the
cause of many seemingly unrelated conditions. When they die they provide
much of the bulk of the stool. People who have hypochlorhydria, (low
stomach acid), tend to have higher bacterial counts and anaerobes and
coliforms, not normally found in the stomach. So if the stomach doesn¹t
work properly, there will be micro-organisms from the large intestine
getting into the stomach and small intestine, rather than just the large
intestine where they belong.

So as you can see, the stomach is the centre of our digestive universe,
and all systems down stream of it are dependent on it to do their jobs
efficiently. A healthy diet is of great importance, and together with
complete digestion health can be restored and maintained.
