Success/Wellness is primarily a function of the genetic 
behavior code rather than the environment as commonly 
believed. Joel Marie and Champion Kurt Teutsch discovered 
this sensational truth over 40 years ago. They modified 
the code for over 100,000 grateful clients, among them 
business, show biz and political leaders. Since 1959, 
millions more benefited through "From Here to Greater 
Happiness or How to Change Your Life for Good." This 
landmark volume spawned at least 57 self-help books.

Section 2    Negative Magnetic Field Production 
                  of Melatonon  (part two) 

                    By Dr. Boyce N. Berkel 
         http://www.uniquenterprises.com/html/mt.htm

             page; http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html 
 
----------      

The Negative Magnetic Field Production of Melatonin is presented 
in a  3-part series. In part one you found out facts about 
melatonin, and the role of the pineal gland in its production.  
Today in Part two,  you will  understand the role your eyes, your 
gastrointestinal tract and your growth hormones play in melatonin 
production and part three will show you how magnetic therapy can 
not only enhance the entire process, but override everyday factors 
that inhibit your production of melatonin.

                    THE ROLE OF RETINA OF THE EYES

It is known that eye retina produces melatonin. This seems 
highly significant in that the eyes have such a need to be 
protected from free radicals and melatonin is known to be a 
free radical scavenger. Free radicals have a significant 
role in the production of such eye conditins as cataracts 
and macular degeneration. This would also point out the 
importance of treating the eyes with a negative magnetic 
field during sleep in order to be sure, and clear the eyes 
of any damaging free radicals. 

You should sleep at night with magnets over your eyes. It is 
very important that there be no light coming into your eyes. 
Additional value could be that if there is any light coming 
in through a window or if your work is such that they sleep 
in the daytime, you should also wear a light inhibiting patch 
over your eyes. It is very important that the eyes not receive 
any light during the sleep period since such a light would 
prevent the retina from making its proper amount of melatonin. 
If the melatonin is not made in proper amounts it could 
encourage the production of cataracts, macular degeneration, 
infections of the eyes or other degenerative conditions of 
the eye. Since it is also known that melatonin governs the 
depth of sleep, it would be important to treat the eyes to 
increase the depth of sleep.

               THE ROLE OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

There are cells in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract 
that produces melatonin. For this reason, it is important to 
magnetically treat the gastrointestinal tract. This could be 
achieved by sleeping on a magnetic bed pad, but even more 
valuable would be to sleep with a magnet pad across your 
abdomen. The pad across the abdomen will also help in reducing 
fat in the abdomen. Melatonin has been documented as having 
a calming effect on the gastrointestinal tract. A negative 
magnetic field has been observed to not only have a calming 
effect on the gastrointestinal tract even before melatonin 
has a chance to be produced, but also  to increase the depths 
of sleep. 

             	THE ROLE OF GROWTH HORMONE

Growth hormone, like all other hormones, is under the control of 
melatonin. Growth hormone is responsible for the health of skin, 
hair, nails, muscle mass, the ability of fat cells to drop their 
fat and the ability of amino acids to be made into proteins. 
Growth hormone has to be present when growth and repair occur 
It is known that the repair of injury is under the control of a 
negative magnetic field.

Dropping fat from the fat cells such as placing a negative 
magnetic field over an obese abdomen and finding that it 
reduces would be that of helping the growth hormone in its 
functions so that the fat cells drop their fat. It is of 
interest to know that this dropping of fat from the fat 
cells occurs only at night when growth hormone is present. 
There is not enough growth hormone present during the day 
to achieve such a goal. Therefore weight reduction, that is 
reducing the fat, is a process that occurs at night during 
sleep. Maybe there is such a thing as "beauty sleep" because 
if a person has enough growth hormone it will help them not 
have wrinkles because the skin will retain its normal 
thickness. They would not have wasted muscles because they 
would continue to maintain their muscle mass. Their hair 
will be improved including the color of the hair and reduce 
graying. The production of oil by the skin and the scalp will 
be present.  Obviously,, all of this is occurring because of 
a rise in growth hormone.

Many people have noted that the repair of a cut or surgical 
wound will heal much more rapidly when a negative magnetic 
field is placed over the area than when it is not treated 
with a negative magnetic field. Ideally, any cut, bruise, 
injury or infection should be locally treated with a negative 
magnetic field but also backed up with the systemic negative 
magnetic field treatment, particularly treat the pineal gland 
with a negative magnetic field so it in turn will raise growth 
hormone. Growth hormone, like melatonin, is only made at night 
when asleep. This is also another important reason to have 
good sound sleep produced by stimulation of the pineal gland 
by a negative magnetic field. It is not known whether growth 
hormone is produced by direct magnetic stimulation of the 
pituitary area or only secondarily by a rise in melatonin.

Next month in Part three, you will understand  how magnetic 
therapy can not only enhance the entire process of melatonin 
production, but override everyday factors that inhibit your 
production of melatonin.

Section 4    	Post Holiday Headaches and
                        Depression
                by Dr. Gerald H. Smith  
		Author of headaches Aren't Forever
		http://www.icnr.com/
----------

Every year millions of people are plagued with post holiday
headaches and depression. Although modern medicine estimates 
that there are over three hundred potential sources for this 
malady, many doctors overlook the obvious- vitamin deficiencies 
and intestinal toxemia.

The holiday season ushers in a time of celebration and with it
comes frequent consumption of sugar, alcohol, fats, excess 
refined foods (cookies, cakes, soft drinks and pies) and fast 
foods. This dietary overload sets the stage for B vitamin 
deficiencies and increased putrefaction of protein within the 
intestines. The problem is compounded by a lack of dietary fiber, 
which speeds transient time of waste passing through the intestines, 
and the fact that most people eating the typical American diet are
nutritionally deficient. 

Thomas D. Spies, MD.., past Associate Professor of Medicine,
University of Cincinnati and director of the Nutrition Clinic,
Hillman Hospital researched and wrote a great deal about 
malnutrition. Doctor Spies and others presented the symptoms of B
complex deficiency many years ago: muscular weakness, lassitude, 
irritability, depression, memory loss, headache, nervousness,
palpitation, anxiety, apprehension, morbid fears, mental confusion, 
rage, hostility, hypochondria, noise sensitivity and "a constant 
feeling of something dreadful is about to happen." The high 
consumption of proteins and refined carbohydrate foods coupled 
with an inadequate intake of foods rich in B vitamins (dark green 
leafy vegetables) are the underlying causes for many headaches and 
depression. 

A review of the scientific literature documents the fact that a
diet high in protein causes a predominance in the intestine of
proteolytic putrefactive bacteria which produce highly toxic
compounds, some of which become absorbed into the blood stream.
Some of the more common substances present are: histamine (dilates
blood vessels, depression, congestion, heart arrhythmia, nausea,
fall in blood pressure) , tyramine (can raise blood pressure),
phenol (causes tissue injury with direct contact) and hydrogen
sulfide (as poisonous as cyanide). The accumulated toxic wastes
slows intestinal movement. The delayed movement may even be 
accompanied by one or more movements of the bowel per day. This
information removes the foundation to the widely held belief that
daily elimination removes most toxic waste.

Seven recommendations to help combat post holiday headaches and 
depression:

1. Increase consumption of fiber foods (fresh vegetables, salads 
   and fruit).
2. Consume smaller portions of protein (red meats, chicken, pork, 
   fish) at meals.
3. Take digestive plant enzymes with meals.
4. Add natural B complex vitamins into your daily diet.
5. Drink at least four or five glasses of spring water per day 
   between meals. Consume a glass one half hour before mealtime. 
   This will help curb your appetite, prevent diluting the 
   digestive enzymes while eating and help flush toxins out of 
   the body.
6. Eat fewer sweets and reduce alcohol consumption.
7. Allow at least three hours after eating before going to bed.

Incorporating natural vitamins into one's diet and making simple 
lifestyle changes will insure a happier holiday for all.
