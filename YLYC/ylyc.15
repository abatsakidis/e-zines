Section 3    ADD: A "Rose" By Any Other Name . . .
	      Part II of "The Dilemma of ADD/ADHD"

		By Dr. Joe Carr, Ph.D., C.N.C.


Sometimes knowing what something is NOT can be as valuable 
as what it is. With ADD, we have found that this is often
the case. ADD is not a disease, which can be cured with a 
medication, nor is it a behavioral problem that can be
addressed with behavioral modification or strong discipline.

ADD - WHAT IS IT?
Technically defined as developmentally inappropriate 
inattention and impulsivity, with or without hyperactivity, 
ADD is a "disorder" as defined by the American Psychiatric
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third 
Edition -Revised (DSM-III-R). It is implicated in learning 
disorders and, except for moderate to profound mental 
retardation, can influence the behavior of children at any 
learning level. It's central feature is trouble getting 
things done, both at home and at school, and trouble
getting along with adults and other children. 

According to many sources, ADD is estimated to affect 10% 
of boys and 3% of girls from 4 to 11 years old, a total
of 5 to 10% of school-aged children, precipitating half of 
the childhood referrals to diagnostic clinics. Most
authorities agree that ADD is seen 10 times more common in 
boys than girls.

Yet, despite its frequent use as a diagnosis, one can make a 
strong argument that ADD is a collection of symptoms rather 
than a true diagnostic entity. Take a simple tour though the
several recent volumes of the American Psychiatric 
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders and you will view the uncertainty surrounding the 
diagnosis. During the past 20-30 years, this condition has
been labeled minimal brain damage, minimal brain dysfunction, 
behavior and learning disorder; hyperkinetic-impulsive 
disorder; hyperkinetic syndrome, developmental hyperactivity, 
and finally attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

ADD - WHAT IT'S NOT
Nevertheless, we digress. We want to examine what ADD is NOT. 
There are several alternatives or candidates for what is not 
ADD. Their symptomologies may overlap and certainly they are
confused with, and diagnosed as, ADD. 

THE CANDIDATES, PLEASE
Therefore, who are these ADD "impostors?" Among the more common 
are the following:

1 - Food allergy/sensitivities. Food and inhalant allergies, 
especially salicylates, phenolic food components and 
traditional antigens (Swain, 41-2; McGovern, 1983)
2 - Hypoglycemia (Langseth and Dowd, 1978)
3 - Nutrient deficiencies: Many nutrient deficiencies can 
cause impaired CNS function. Iron is the most common
nutrient deficiency in American children. Most research has 
been done with vitamin B-6, vitamin B-3, and calcium. 
(Brenner, 1982)
4 - Lead toxicity: It has been estimated that the human body 
can tolerate about 1 mg of lead without suffering from toxic
side effects. In an urban environment, the average person 
ingests, with solid foods, 1 mg/wk. Another 0.1 mg/wk comes
from beverages. The World Health Organization estimates only 
10% of the lead ingested is actually absorbed. Typical 
airborne inhalation of lead in an urban environment is about 
0.2 mg/day. Researchers have demonstrated that children absorb 
and retain much higher amounts of lead than adults do.
5 - Food additive sensitivities, the "Feingold hypothesis": 
Benjamin Feingold, M.D. estimated that 40-50% of hyperactive 
children are sensitive to artificial food colors, flavors, and
preservatives as well as naturally occurring salicylates and 
phenolic compounds. 
6 - Abnormal lighting: TV and fluorescent lighting
7 - Improperly functioning thyroid: The thyroid is a small 
gland that has a large responsibility - it secretes hormones, 
which are essential in regulating metabolism. This affects
other organ functions and the manner the body is able to use 
food and energy. (Barnes and Galton, 1976)
8 - Learning Problems: Most classrooms are designed for 
left-brained, visual and auditory learning - most of the
thinking is done with the left side of the brain and is 
logical in nature. What of the child who is right-brained and
tends to be more artistic and less logical? Children in this 
category find it difficult to learn and stay focused, enough 
so that they can disrupt the class and be suspected of being ADD.
Dyslexia is another similar type of problem in that the words 
literally transpose themselves in the child's brain and he 
cannot make sense of it. Autism, while not as similar, also
creates a situation that is misinterpreted. Even a problem like
Tourette's Syndrome can fall into this category.
9 - Psychological problems: Divorce, deaths and other traumas 
can create situations that, if not considered, can cause a 
diagnosis of ADD.

So, while the diagnosis of ADD is frequently resorted to and 
is commonly used, and perhaps excessively relied upon, by 
parents, teachers and school officials, caution and 
circumspection are recommended in making the decision to 
label a child with the diagnosis of ADD. In many cases, once 
the parents and child have accepted the label of "ADD" the 
element of determinism seems certain and no one seems to accept 
the possibility of improvement through observation, initiative 
and change; the label provides too easy an excuse for every 
difficult situation.

In the next installment we will look at some of the drug 
treatments, and their side effects, that are employed in
treating ADD.

Section 5   	Magnetic Energy - The Energy of Life

	How Many Times Have You Heard Yourself Say...   
		"I Wish I Had More Energy!"

			By Dr. Boyce N. Berkel

This report is written by Boyce N. Berkel, M.D. It was 
condensed and adapted by permission from Dr. William H. 
Philpotts book "Biomagnetic Handbook." Dr. Philpott is 
currently doing FDA approved research in Magnetic 
Therapy, and is taking applications. For more information

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Energy is essential to your health and well being. But 
where does energy come from, and where does energy go? 
To answer these questions, it must be fully understood 
that your physical and mental energy are in reality 
magnetic energy which is produced in several different 
ways. You see, your life involves many physical and mental 
responses, all governed by electromagnetic energy.

What Are Your Sources of Energy?

1) FOOD AND WATER - these are digested and absorbed, 
ultimately producing electromagnetic energy. 

2) SLEEP - this is nature's energy recharging process. 
When you're awake, your positive magnetic energy drive 
of physical and mental concentration is higher than your 
negative magnetic energy drive, and you "burn up" energy. 
When you sleep, the negative magnetic energy drive is higher 
than the positive magnetic energy drive, thus replenishing 
your energy stores.

3) ABSORBED MAGNETIC ENERGY - you absorb energy from the 
earth's magnetic field, and from inhaled oxygen, through 
its paramagnetic action. It is interesting to note that 
the higher the surrounding magnetic energy, the higher 
is your magnetic energy function.

Did you know that sharks and insects both derive their 
energy mostly from magnetic fields, but interestingly 
both are resistant to viral infectious diseases including 
cancer? Insects have no immune system. Negative magnetic 
field energy is alkalinizing (pH normalizing), anti-
inflammatory and oxygenating, all of which can solve many 
health problems without involving the immune system. It 
appears that the first line of defense in health is 
actually negative magnetic field energy, with the immune 
response running second.

4)  OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY - The flow of fluid through 
a magnetic field produces magnetic energy. It can be 
reasonably assumed that the flow of blood through your 
body produces an internal source of magnetic energy. Bones 
produce electromagnetic energy from flexion and stress during 
exercise, and electrolysis of cerebral spinal fluid during 
sleep produces biological energy.

Your life's energy therefore is not a single energy, but a 
balance of two distinctly separate energies - negative 
magnetic energy and positive magnetic energy. You are an 
electromagnetic organism plugged into the magnetic fields 
of the earth, sun and moon, and are influenced by external 
exposures and changes as well as internal stresses.

What Really Saps You Of Energy?

Your health is actually a battle of energies. Negative/
positive magnetic energy balance vs. positive magnetic 
energy attackers (both internal and external). This balance 
is critical. When positive magnetic energy strength exceeds 
negative magnetic energy strength for very long, physical 
and/or emotional symptoms occur.

Internal Influences that alter your magnetic energy balance 
and sap you of energy are allergens (foods, animals, plants 
etc.) nutritional deficiencies, addictions (caffeine, 
nicotine, drugs, alcohol etc.) infections, metabolic 
disorders and others.

External influences that alter your magnetic energy balance 
and sap you of energy are:-

CHEMICAL TOXINS - Do you sometimes feel completely wiped 
out after shopping, or after work or other such activity? 
This could very well be due to exposure to petrochemical 
hydrocarbon products, auto exhaust, building materials, 
cleaning supplies, plastic fabrics, carpet materials and 
treatments, fabric dyes and treatments, perfumes, cigarette 
smoke etc.

GEOMAGNETIC DISTURBANCES - when sun flares jar the earth's 
magnetic field, they produce a higher ratio of positive 
magnetic energy to negative magnetic energy. Local magnetic 
fields are also altered by moon phases etc. Researchers have 
noted an increase on heart attacks during periods of 
geomagnetic disturbance, and emergency room workers will 
testify to the increased number of people who become 
emotionally disturbed during such times.

ELECTROMAGNETIC CONTAMINATION - chronic low-level 
electromagnetic radiation from power lines, electric 
blankets, household appliances, computer terminals etc. 
pose another environmental threat. Prolonged exposure to 
these appliances has been observed to produce positive 
magnetic field effects (lethargy, fatigue, illness etc.)

MAGNETIC FIELD DEFICIENCY SYNDROME - not only do metal 
buildings, automobiles, trains etc. shield you from the 
earth's natural energy source, but they are absorbing 
the earth's magnetic field, causing interference and 
loss of gauss strength. In fact, the earth's magnetic 
field has diminished 50% over the past 500 hundred years.

AMALGAM DENTAL FILLINGS - these create a positive magnetic 
field that not only encourages microorganism replication, 
but also interfere with biological energy in general, and 
brain function in particular. Weakness and ringing in the 
ears have been observed to be the main symptoms of such 
electromagnetic interference.

What Can You Do To Preserve And Increase Energy?

In addition to proper sleep, exercise, and proper diet and 
nutrition, the application of negative magnetic energy plays 
a significant role in maintaining optimum energy. Negative 
magnetic energy combats internal stresses and external 
influences. With sufficient negative magnetic field exposure, 
the battle for energy and health can be won. When your body 
is overstressed with positive magnetic energy attackers, 
externally applied negative magnetic energy will provide 
support. You should consider magnetic application not only 
as a preventive therapy, but also as a therapeutic modality 
for relieving symptoms and illnesses. In upcoming articles, 
you will learn about the health promoting effects and 
applications of negative magnetic energy.

This is a Recipe for ADD/ADHD Children. It's great 
addition for their lunches or an after school snack.

For six large servings;

Core and shred one head green cabbage in a food processor
Put in a large bowl and add;

1       LARGE RED BELL PEPPER, sliced.
2       STALKS OF CELERY, sliced.
4 CARROTS, shredded.
1/2 CUP OF TOASTED WALNUTS.
1/2 CUP OF RAISINS.
1       TEASPOON OF DILL WEED.
4 TBS. OF WHITE WINE VINEGAR. 
2 TBS. OF LEMON JUICE.
1 TBS. OF FRUCTOSE.

Mix and toss gently to coat.  Cover and chill while you 
make the mayonnaise. 

Enough for 2 cups;

Blend in a blender;

2 TBS WHITE WINE VINEGAR.
2 TBS LEMON JUICE.
1 EGG.
1/4 Teaspoon  SEA SALT.
1/2 Teaspoon DRY MUSTARD.

Optional;  1 SLICED AVOCADO.

With the blender still running, pour 1 1/4 Cups of Oil in 
a slow steady stream through the hole in the blender lid 
until mayonnaise thickens and turns creamy. There is 
definitely a taste difference from store-bought mayonnaise.  
I would suggest using cold pressed flax oil as it is a 
great source of essential fatty acids and adds a nutty 
flavour to it. 

As you can see, this recipe is high in alkalizing minerals.  
Many imbalances can be helped by returning the body to an 
alkaline state. If possible, use organically grown vegetables.

Add about a half a cup to the coleslaw and toss to coat. 
Adjust the amount to your own taste.
