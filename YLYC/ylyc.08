Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

     My daughter Leanne has asthma as of 2 years now.
Her attacks would be quite severe, resulting in me taking
her to the hospital. She has been taking White Willow
and Echinacea for 1 year now and I see a tremendous
difference in her. Her allergies are pretty much gone,
and she's had no severe asthma attacks. She's had very
mild asthma discomfort since taking these herbs.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

    My Grandson was 8 years of age going into grade 3
and I was worried sick for him. The reason being, he
was born without an anus. At 3 years of age his colostomy
was removed and through surgery, they constructed an
anus for him. Since then he had to wear a diaper. His
mother had to go to school on his first day of school to
change him five times.
    A very dear friend suggested we give him a good fiber
supplement. What a blessing! My grandson no longer
needs to wear a diaper, and the kids don't tease him any more.

Section 3   SPRING ALLERGIES: TIP FOR MANAGING THE MISERY

                                        By Laura Southard
                                        Healthy Environments
                                        http://healthyenvironments.com.

"Healthy Environments" started in 1997. We are located in Seattle, WA, a
leading city in
recycling, and environmental concerns. This company was borne out of a
frustration for
the lack of easy, affordable solutions to annoying problems and a
concern for our impact
on our natural environment. What we realized was that we had to take
control of the
things in our lives that we could, including what we buy, what we eat,
what we drink, and
what we breathe: Healthy Environments is our response to this!

We are working hard to guarantee your satisfaction and earn your
support, respect, and
trust in the fulfillment of our mission. We firmly believe that YOU can
make all the
difference in the world in both the health of your family and for the
earth by what you
choose to do and what you choose to buy.

 ----------

Here we go again! For as much as we love it, spring
can spell misery for some 20-30 million Americans
who suffer from a specific type of allergy called
seasonal allergic rhinitis, better known as hay fever.
Spring allergies can often trigger or worsen asthma
and other respiratory illnesses.  Adverse reactions
can include itchy and watery eyes, sore throat, hives,
eczema, stomach cramps, sneezing itching, dark circles
under the eyes, and fatigue: Some 6 million children
suffer from upper respiratory problems. And according
to the Allergy and Immunology Institute, about 129
million school days are lost due to asthma and respiratory
illnesses.
  Allergies and the search for relief  is big business:  We
can expect that Americans spend  4 billion dollars on
allergy reduction methods and medications, from
antihistamines to allergy testing:

The majority of spring respiratory problems come from
inhaling allergens, such as pollens and molds. Further
exposure to dust, pet dander and other indoor problems
can worsen the severity of spring allergies:, essentially
adding "fuel to the fire"

Pollens:
As any sufferer knows, pollens from trees and grasses
are the first to appear and the first to begin producing
the symptoms.  Alders and juniper type plants can
begin to produce pollens as early as January.  To make
matters worse, this allergy season could be one of the
worst on record thanks to El Nino.

TIPS FOR REDUCING THE MISERY.
1 Avoid outdoor activities at peak pollen times. The
peak pollen hours are between 5 A.M. and 10 am. Any
time air pollution and pollen levels are high, it's a good
idea to stay indoors.
2. Use a respiratory/dust mask when cutting grasses,
gardening or raking leaves: These can be purchased
at most drug stores.
3. Pollens can and do travel into your home environment,
though windows, on shoes and clothing and on pets:
Keep windows closed during windy periods and peak
pollen times.
4. Reduce exposure to other allergens:
Smoke:  If you must... do it outside, away from the
allergic/asthmatic person(s). Keep pets out of bedrooms
of allergic/asthmatic people: Consider increasing the
number of baths you give your pets to reduce dander,
saliva (check with your vet on the best shampoos for
frequent bathing). Dust /Dust Mites Dust mites are
usually found in house dust. They feed on dead skin.
Although there may seem to be no easy way to rid
our homes of dust and dust mites, there are solutions
to reducing your exposure:

Put mattresses in airtight covers. Wash all bedding every
week in water that is at least 130 degrees F.
Consider a HEAP or high particle efficiency vacuum
cleaner.  This is an excellent way to help remove dust
and mites, as they are trapped inside the filters, not
recirculated back into the air when you clean.

Indoor Mold
When humidity is high,(  generally above 40%) molds
can be a problem in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements.
Make sure these areas have good air circulation and are
cleaned often.

Strong Odors Or Fumes
Avoid cleaning chemicals, ( use non toxic alternatives),
paints and solvents: If you must work with these substances,
Always work in a well ventilated area and drink lots of
water to help flush away the toxins.  Other culprits include
perfumes and toners used in copying and fax machines.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Consider air purification/filtering as an added means
of removing particulate such as pollens, molds and dust
from indoor air:
2. Seek a Dr's advice when severity of allergies cannot
be self managed.

Section 5            Slippery Elm: The Demulcent Herb
Reprint permission granted by Kelly Smith from Frontier Herbs
                            http://www.frontierherb.com/

Slippery elm, Umlauts rubella, is also known as red elm,
moose elm and Indian elm. Its natural habitat is the
United States and Canada. In the United States it grows
from Maine to the Dakotas, south to Texas and east to
Florida. In Canada it grows in the southernmost eastern
half of the country. The tree reaches 60 feet tall and
grows to two feet in diameter at its trunk, which has
thick, brownish-gray bark and a sweet, earthy fragrance.
Its leaves are larger than those of the American elm and
its buds are maroon red. The early spring flowers of the
slippery elm are small, red star bursts which contain a
favorite pollen for bees. Because slippery elm is one of
spring's earliest blooming plants, its pollen is vital for
bees to build strong colonies. The slippery elm tree may
be at risk.

Slippery elm has traditionally been used by herbalists
and folk healers for soothing the throat, improving
digestion, intestinal health and urinary tract health.
* It is well suited for sensitive mucous membrane
linings throughout the body.

Several Native American tribes used slippery elm for
healing purposes. Uses ranged from healthful teas to
making poultices for toothaches and for removing
thorns and bullets.

Slippery elm inner bark is demulcent, emollient, mildly
astringent and nutritive. Considered one of the most
valuable remedies in herbal practice, its abundant
mucilage has wonderful strengthening, healing and
soothing qualities. The inner bark is highly nutritious
and when made into a gruel forms a wholesome and
sustaining food which is easily assimilated by infants
and invalids. The gruel can be made by mixing a
teaspoon of the powder with cold water to make a
smooth paste, then adding a pint of boiling water
while stirring. It may also be simmered gently for 10
minutes. For a special flavor add sweet spices and lemon.
Slippery elm gruel may be eaten freely except by those
who are overweight, as it may cause congestion for them.
It was adopted as an official drug for the first U.S.
Pharmacopoeia in 1820 and was listed until 1936.
Slippery elm can be taken as a tea, gruel, paste, capsule
or liquid extract.

Although not as widely affected as the American elm,
slippery elm is a victim of Dutch elm disease. As with
American elm it shows no resistance to Dutch elm
disease according to information provided by Michigan
State University. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus,
Graphium ulmi, which is carried by the elm bark beetle.
This beetle was first introduced to the United States in
1930 in a load of logs from Europe. Once a tree becomes
infected it normally lives only about two years. The
American elm has all but disappeared, due primarily to
Dutch elm disease. Some concerned individuals have
suggested starting slippery elm plantations to provide
seed stock and keep this valuable tree alive. The
disease does not generally attack trees less than 10
years old. Some trees from the plantations could also
be harvested for their herbal value.

One way to reduce the demand for slippery elm is to
encourage the use of substitutes. According to Rosemary
Gladstar, a highly respected herbalist, marshmallow root
is the best overall substitute. It contains a high percentage
of mucilage and works well to soothe mucous membranes.
Since no one herb can totally replace the qualities of
slippery elm, she recommends licorice root for soothing
the throat and lungs, while flax and psyllium work well for
the lower bowels.*

Section 5                  Eucalyptus Essential Oil
Reprint permission granted by Kelly Smith from Frontier Herbs
                            http://www.frontierherb.com/

----------

The genus Eucalyptus makes up nearly 3/4 of Australia's
total number of plant species. In the late 1700's, early
botanists first tackled the job of describing the more
than 500 species of eucalyptus trees. The job isn't yet
complete. New varieties and hybrids are still being
discovered, and old classifications revised.

Eucalyptus trees are known as gum trees because they
exude a sticky, tannin rich substance known as kino.
Thanks to its astringent properties, kino has a history of
medicinal use. At one time it was also used as a tanning
agent in the manufacture of leather goods.

Another common name for eucalyptus is fever tree. 19th
century British colonists, noting the fragrant, medicinal
aroma of eucalyptus groves, planted the trees in tropical
fever ridden districts throughout the Empire in an effort
to drive away insects and contagious disease. An added
plus (in the colonists¹ eyes) was that the trees also tended
to dry out water-logged soils with their extensive, hungry
root systems, making marshy soils into arable, habitable
land. This deterred disease carrying insects, especially
mosquitoes, which need standing water to breed.

The many different eucalyptus species along with the oils
they produce can be divided into three groups.

Medicinal and aromatherapy oils such as
E. globulus and
E. radiata.
Industrial oils.
Perfumery oils, mainly E. citriodora.

The primary active constituent in the medicinal/
aromatherapy eucalyptus species is cineol, also
known as eucalyptol. Cineol's medicinal,
camphoraceous aroma has antiseptic and expectorant
properties. The brisk aroma is energizing.

The eucalyptus oil most often used in perfumery is
eucalyptus citriodora, the lemon scented eucalyptus.
Lemon eucalyptus contains up to 90% citronellal along
with geraniol. Both of these constituents are primary
fragrancing compounds in the perfume and cosmetics
industry. Such a high percentage of citronellal in one
botanical source makes its extraction very cost effective.

Aromatherapy applications rely on the activating, vitalizing
and energizing actions the aroma of eucalyptus inspires.
An activating eucalyptus massage oil is effective for sore
and aching muscles.

Combine the following:

     20 drops eucalyptus
     20 drops lavender
     5 drops peppermint
     20 drops rosewood
     5 drops wintergreen

Add not more than 36 drops of this blend to 3 ounces
of sweet almond oil. Shake briefly. Massage a small
amount into tired, achy muscles and joints.

The brisk scent of eucalyptus adds an inspiring note to
a water based workout spritzer. This activating formula
is great to carry in the gym. Whenever a workout
routine needs a little boost simply spritz your face lightly
and inhale the fresh, invigorating aroma.

Combine the following essential oils:

     20 drops eucalyptus
     40 drops lavender
     20 drops lemon
     10 drops petitgrain
     10 drops spearmint

Add not more than 36 drops of this blend to 3 ounces
of distilled water. Shake vigorously and add to a bottle
with a spray atomizer attachment. Be sure to shake the
bottle before each application. Not only is this blend
inspiring - it also combats locker room odor.

The use of eucalyptus oil in spiritual aromatherapy is
limited, probably because its aroma is so powerful and
medicinal. But small amounts of eucalyptus oil skillfully
blended with uplifting, gently inspiring oils such as
bergamot, lemon and lavender support and activate
transcendent, as opposed to deeply reflective, meditative
inner work.

A spiritually energizing blend might include the following
essential oils:

     30 drops bergamot
     50 drops lemon
     20 drops lemon eucalyptus

Add 10 to 15 drops of this blend to 1/4 cup distilled
water and place the mixture in an aromatherapy candle
diffuser lamp. The gentle diffusion created by a flickering
candle lamp is very effective in spiritual aromatherapy work.

The uses and aromatherapy applications of eucalyptus
essential oils are as varied and adaptable as the widely
planted trees themselves. Medicine, industry, perfumery
and of course aromatherapy have all come to rely on
the properties of eucalyptus oil, and are likely to do so
in the future.

Section 6                      CHOICE TIDBITS
                                    Six Tips for drinking more water

In recent Healthy Habits I've been encouraging you to
drink more water as a part of your lifestyle.  In fact I
recommend working your way up to a gallon per day.
(Even more when you are physically active)  But at the
very least, more than the "media hyped" 8 glasses per
day.

1) Start early.  Drink as much as you can when you first
wake up and during the early hours.  Your body
becomes very dehydrated during sleep.
2) Drink water at room temperature.  It's easier to drink
more this way and it's easier for your body to assimilate.
3) Set up your life so that you can urinate regularly.  I
know there are a few jobs where this is impossible but
only a few!  It's also a great benefit of working at home. :-)
This constant flow of water in and out of your body has
a wonderful cleansing effect which will really improve
your health over time.
4) Don't drink anything else (except herbal tea and a
small amount of fruit juice).  Avoid soft drinks at all
costs.
5) Drink before you eat rather then during.  This will
help your digestion.
6) Drink bottled or filtered water.  It tastes better.

                        Don't watch TV while eating

I'm not a big fan of television (except for televised soccer
games, but that’s just me!)  One because most of it is
negative and violent and I just don't like those images
going into my mind.  And also because many of the
commercials put totally wrong ideas into your thinking.
Like Coke is good for you (it's terrible) and that taking
antacid pills is great 'cause you can eat terrible stuff
without feeling sick.  But it's especially important to
void the TV while eating for two reasons.
1) You don't want all those negative images going into your mind
while your taking food into your body.
2) It distracts you from paying attention to your body so that its
far too easy to keep eating after you are really full.

It's best to eat in peace or in communion with friends and family
