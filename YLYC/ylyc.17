What do you think is the largest source of dietary
fat for women? Suprisingly it's salad dressing!
Many women eat lots of salads in an attempt to lose
weight and/or eat a healthy diet. However, many
fail to realize how much fat is in a typical salad
dressing. Choose your salad dressings carefully!

Section 3    	Electromagnetic Contamination
				and
		     How It Affects You.

			By Dr. Boyce N. Berkel

This report is written by Boyce N. Berkel, M.D. It was 
condensed and adapted by permission from Dr. William H. 
Philpotts book "Biomagnetic Handbook." Dr. Philpott is 
currently doing FDA approved research in Magnetic 
Therapy, and is taking applications. For more information 
on this timely and very fascinating subject, go to 
http://www.i-netmall.com/shops/relief/
~~~~~~~~~~

Did you know that you live in an environment of 
electromagnetic contamination, that is adversely affecting
your health?

Anytime an electric current is present, there will be an 
associated negative-positive magnetic field. Prolonged 
simultaneous exposure to a low (yet beyond human adaptation) 
or high gauss strength of both magnetic fields has been 
observed to be capable of producing positive magnetic field 
effects (lethargy, fatigue, illness etc.) on biological 
systems. Such prolonged biomagnetic exposure can upset the 
magnetic balance (negative-positive) of your body, causing 
disordering of your energy systems including brain function. 

Studies Reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology 
have shown that children living in homes near overhead 
electrical wires carrying high current, died of cancer 
at twice the rate as children living in houses near low 
current wiring.  

Consider the effects of the 24-hour-a-day exposure of your 
body to frequencies and electrical waves not only from 60 
cycle AC wired into your home and workplace, but also to 
the chronic low grade magnetic exposure from household 
appliances including TV and Video display terminals. These 
produce strong magnetic fields up to 1-2 feet from the screen.

In addition, you are chronically exposed to the invisible 
waves from radio, telephone, police, fire and utility 
signals, as well as microwaves with various vibratory 
rates. All of these environmental electric pulsating 
frequencies differ from those of human adaptation, and 
interfere with your metabolic function. 

Your cells, organs and entire body have a unique functional 
vibratory rate, and react to subtle energy flows. These 
energy flows are constantly bombarding your body while 
awake or asleep. 

The natural pulsating frequency of the earth is approximately 
7.96 cycles per second. This is the healthy vibrational 
frequency of the human body as a whole. When asleep, the 
rhythm of the brain runs from 1-2 cycles per second, and 
while awake and alert 8-12 cycles per second. With mental 
concentration this increases to 18-22 cycles per second. In 
today's highly industrialized world, we live in a virtual 
sea of metabolically disturbing electro-magnetic frequencies 
and biologically disordering positive magnetic fields. You 
can therefore easily understand how 60 cycle AC electric 
current and varying frequencies of radio waves, etc. are 
disordering the biologic metabolic function of man and 
animals alike.


Here's What You Can Do To Protect Against Electromagnetic 
Contamination, and Preserve Your Energy and Health.


Follow a few simple precautions. These include the following.

1. Investigate your home, yard and immediate surroundings 
   for possible electromagnetic contamination areas and 
   consider measures to reduce exposure.
2. Unplug waterbed heaters when occupying the bed.
3. Discontinue use of electric blankets, until redesigned 
   to reduce magnetic field emissions.
4. As far as possible, keep other electric appliances out 
   of the bedroom. If you must have your electric clock, 
   keep it several feet away from the bedside.
5. Sit at least 3 or more feet from any TV or video screen.

Follow a program of negative magnetic field therapy. This 
will provide protection against harmful magnetic fields. 
It can also be of value for existing physical and emotional 
illnesses where the magnetic balance has already been 
disrupted. This would include the following.

1. Ideally a Magnetic bed provides a protective shield of 
   negative magnetic and natural earth frequency about the 
   body during sleeping hours.
2. If a magnetic bed is not available, follow the Nightly 
   Routine. (see pg. 28

Section 5   	ADD: Ritalin & Associates

	Part III of "The Dilemma of ADD/ADHD"
		By Joe Carr, Ph.D., C.N.C.

Dr. Joe Carr is a Psychologist, Certified Nutritional 
Counselor and Certified Microscopist Technician. He is 
currently completing his dissertation for a doctorate of 
Naturopathy, is a member of the International Society of
Orthomolecular Medicine, the American Nutraceutical 
Association, the American Academy of Environmental 
Medicine, and the American Association of Nutritional
Consultants. He is a partner in Wellness Therapies, a 
wellness clinic in St. Louis, MO and specializes in 
working with children who have been diagnosed as ADD/ADHD. 
He employs a completely natural approach to the problem of 
ADD and can be contacted at wellness@primary.net.
~~~~~~~~~~

In 1996, more than 2.5 million children in the U.S. took 
Ritalin on a regular basis to help them cope with the 
dilemma of Attention Deficit Disorder. This was an 
increase of more than a two and one half times the number 
taking the drug in 1990. While estimates vary, the total
number of children on Ritalin has probably increased to 
4-5 million or more per year. There are predictions that 
the current rate of escalation will result in 8 million 
children or more by the year 2000. If you do not have a
child who is taking it, ask around at work, church or at 
social events and you will find someone who has a child 
taking the medication. It seems that ADD and Ritalin have 
become synonymous.

One would think, because of all of the press it receives, 
that Ritalin is the only drug used to treat ADD. Not so. 
It has several cousins that are also widely used: 
Dexedrine and DextroStat, Adderall, Desoxyn and Gradumet, 
and Cylert. Except for Cylert, all of these drugs have 
nearly identical effects and side effects - they are 
stimulants. Ritalin and all the others (which are
amphetamines) can be considered as one type of drug.

A wonderful source of information on these drugs and 
their effects can be found in the book TALKING BACK TO
RITALIN by Dr. Peter Breggin, M.D. There are excellent 
sources of information available on the use and abuse of
stimulants in treating ADD but many are either too 
superficial or too technical. Dr. Breggin has performed 
an invaluable service for those of us who are parents
of children with, or suspected of being, ADD. Most of us 
have felt the pressure of giving drugs to our children 
even though we dislike the idea. Teachers may explain, 
or insist, that stimulants have helped many of their 
students. Friends may claim that Ritalin has "saved" 
their children. We as parents may feel we are depriving 
our children of a legitimate medical treatment that 
could improve the life of our child. It is to this
scenario that Dr. Breggin addresses his book. We need 
to be informed and this is the intent of the book. I 
highly recommend it.

Returning to our topic, among the effect of the various 
stimulants on a child taking them:
--adverse effects on the brain, mind and behavior, 
  including the production of drug-induced behavioral
  disorders, psychosis, mania, drug abuse and addiction
--inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity - the very 
  same problems they are supposed to treat
--the child becoming robotic, lethargic, depressed or 
  withdrawn
--loss of appetite, insomnia, nightmares
--neurological tics, including Tourette's syndrome
--retard growth
--causes gross malfunctions in the brain
--withdrawal can cause emotional suffering, including 
  depression, exhaustion and suicide
--addictive

The stimulants work by producing malfunctions in the brain 
rather than improving brain function. A child taking Ritalin 
will become more docile and obedient. He will be more willing 
to do boring tasks such as classwork or homework. It suppresses 
creative and spontaneous activity. The drugs have no positive 
effect on a child's psychology or academic performance and 
achievement. Rather, when a child has been labeled as ADD and 
has been medicated with a drug like Ritalin, that child has 
been stigmatized for life. It affects their self-image and 
makes them believe they cannot achieve their real potential
without the assistance of a drug.

Please understand that I am NOT condemning anyone who is 
taking a drug approach to dealing with ADD nor am I
slamming the medical community for making it available. 
I am one of those who had taken this path for many years
with my son and am very familiar with the subtle, and not 
so subtle, pressures that can be brought to bear on a parent.
It is my intent to show the other side of the proverbial 
two-edged sword and assist the parent in making an informed
decision.

In our last installment of this series, we will look at some 
of the alternatives that are available to us in treating ADD.

	Sugar Free Treats for ADD/ADHD Children

			APPLE BARS
		By Howie Thomason R.N.C.P.


This is a wholesome treat, easily made, that will satisfy 
the sweet tooth in your children. 

We do not use refined sugars in this recipe. 

Refined sugar includes;

raw sugar, brown sugar, yellow sugar, sucanat, and white 
sugar.  

Refined sugar is sucrose. This is the ultimate naked 
carbohydrate.  ³Whit Death². Stripped of all nutritional 
benefits. Sugar is known to play a negative role in many 
diseases, and can also depress the immune response and the 
body¹s resistance to disease by inhibiting the release of 
growth hormone. 

Following a sugar free diet doesn¹t mean you have to give 
up good taste or the comforts of sweetness. You can use 
honey,  molasses,  maple syrup,  fruit juice or barley malt 
in place of sugar. 


Apple Bars
