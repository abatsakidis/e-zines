                 Letter from the Editor


Has everybody heard? March is Nutrition month. 

I don't believe that there has ever been a time when 
society has been as hectic as it is today. It seems that 
we are all busy, busy with our 9 to 5 jobs, then rushing 
to take one child to dance class and the other to soccer. 
Remember to stop quickly, in your travels, to pick up milk; 
you'll do a full shopping tomorrow after your gym workout. 
And don't forget you promised to go to your best friend's 
candle party on Thursday. Oh my stars!... What are we going 
to have for dinner? When am I going to be able to make it? 
And who's got time to eat it?

I know this sounds like MY life, and I'll be willing to bet 
that there's a few of you out there who share a story similar 
to this. 

Well, because this is Nutrition month, I propose that we all 
do SOMETHING to make a positive change in our eating habits.
Even something as simple as adding one piece of fruit to your 
diet every day. Did you know that studies have found a lower 
risk of cancer among those who eat more fruits and vegetables?
The Canada's Food Guide recommends 5-10 servings of fruits and 
vegetables, and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend 2-4 
servings of fruit and 5-7 servings of vegetables. Bearing in 
mind that these are MINIMUM requirements to maintain a MINIMUM 
standard of health, my guess is that most of us could stand to 
add one more serving to our daily routine. So how about we "grab" 
an apple or a banana while we're on the run, or get adventurous 
with a guava or mango. 

This one little change may not mean the difference between life 
and death, but it IS one significant positive step in the 
direction of optimum health.

Our health is drastically impacted by nutrition. You'll find 
that almost all health issues are more easily controlled by 
adding or eliminating certain foods. We also know that fast 
food is not as high in vitamins and nutrients as our bodies 
require.

We've searched the web and found the perfect site to introduce 
you to this month! Dietitians of Canada brings you Great Food 
Fast! Click on this link and find some wonderful suggestions 
and recipes for the family on the go.  http://www.dietitians.ca/english/frames.html 
I'll bet if you are able to add a few more meals that are high 
in nutrients, you'll find yourself with a little more energy to 
help get you through your hectic schedule. 

Enjoy the newsletter, and stay well until next time.

Becoming aware of the multiplicity of causes and contributing

developed and actualized.

>From the following list of causative factors, look for the ones 
that may pertain to your particular health challenge. The list 
may also stimulate you to find additional causes that may be 
unique for your situation. (Causes of the level of the soul 
and spirit will not be addressed in this article.)

Section 2    Therapeutic Massage: 
		A Valuable Tool for Self-Healing
                   
                  by Laurel Duran, CMT               
              http://www2.amigo.net/bluecord 
----------

        It has been more than twenty years since I first 
began helping others as a Certified Massage Therapist, and 
one single truth has woven itself consistently across the 
miles of my career. Each client is giving me the greatest 
honor one person  can give to another: their trust. I am 
providing a safe haven for my client to lay down their 
worldly shield so we can release the tension they’ve 
collected. I take their trust in me very seriously.      
        
	Not until my seventh year of practice when I had a life-altering experience did I realize the importance of 
trust in a client/Massage Therapist relationship. I had a 
near-death experience car crash in which I visited heaven 
and united in love with the Creator. It was, and remains 
to this day, the most wonderful and challenging experience 
of my life. While on the other side, my spirit was flooded 
with unconditional love directly from the Creator. The joy 
and freedom that came to me was so great that I decided to 
come back into my broken body, then completely paralyzed 
with a broken neck.  Through thick and thin, I tenaciously 
held onto that love and with strong-willed determination, 
I applied it to every thought and second of my life until 
I could walk out of the hospital on my own power. 
        
	Medical professionals I encountered in American 
hospitals often told me I’d never move again, and because 
they did not recognize the value of Massage Therapy combined 
with visualization and prayer, they did not provide the 
bodywork I so desperately needed. So a dear friend 
volunteered to come to the hospital daily to massage my 
limited, suffering body, and to comfort my often-discouraged 
spirit.  She had no formal massage training, but she knew 
very well  how to extend love and hope to someone in need. 
She was endlessly patient as I gave her explicit verbal 
massage directions, and I trusted her compassionate touch 
completely. Together - and with the Creator’s loving power -  
we achieved a successful healing.  For the last 13 years I 
have been running four miles daily, and I continue to  extend
hope and healing to those in need.
        
	My own self-healing experience has taught me that it 
is the spirit, not the body, that is the source of healing 
potential in each one of us. It is impossible to work with 
just the body -- focusing only on which soft tissue is being manipulated using which physical techniques -- while ignoring 
the spirit living within.  But when the mind, emotions and 
spirit of a patient are treated as a unified whole, and with 
the greatest compassion and respect, the physical body is very 
likely to rebuild itself. I believe that each of us contains 
natural potentials for self-healing.
        
	My profession has grown over the years and made 
significant contributions to the changing public mind 
regarding dominion over personal health. Today there are many 
more compassionate Massage Therapists and  many more clients
choosing Massage Therapy over a purely physically-focused 
wellness strategy whose primary tools are surgery and 
medication.  Patients who hunger for nurturing touch are 
discovering that compassionate Massage Therapy is a found 
treasure.  Insurance comapnies have noticed that their 
customers willingly pay the reasonable Massage Therapy fees 
out of their own pockets, a fact that is motivating insurance 
providers to participate in this economic boom by including 
coverage for Massage Therapy.
                
	We used to think that self-nurturance meant being self-centered, but research into the psychology of disease 
is showing us that if we wish to live long healthy lives, 
we must regularly include tension-reducing, pleasurable 
activities in our lives. By nurturing the spirit and the 
body, our health automatically improves. If you haven’t 
received a luxurious Therapeutic Massage lately, why not 
make a well-deserved appointment? While you have greater 
peace to gain, you have nothing to lose but a few pounds 
of tension!

Section 3    		What is Iridology? 
                      By: Joan Vankoughnett 
		    mailto:joana746@sprint.ca
-----

	The science of iridology is based on the analysis of 
one of the most complicated tissue structures of the whole 
body, the iris.

	It is a method whereby the doctor or health 
practitioner can tell, from markings or signs in the iris, 
the reflex condition of various organs and systems of the 
body.

	These markings represent a detailed picture of the 
integrity of the body, its constitutional strength, area of 
congestion or toxic acumulations and inherent strengths and 
weaknesses.  The iris of the eye reveals structural defects, 
toxic settlements, inherent weakness, presence of acids, 
catarrh, prolapus, anemia, nerve tensions, glandular 
disorders, chemical imbalances, congestion and the power 
of recovery.

	The laboratory testing procedures practiced today, 
which are not always necessary, are expensive, time-consuming 
and, often, uncomfortable to the patient.

	Nature has provided us with an invaluable insight 
into the vital status of the health of the body by 
transmitting this information to the eye.

	With iridology, we have a simple, painless, 
economical and non-invasive way of looking into the 
body. It may be employed in conjuction with any other 
system of analysis or diagnosis that a practioner wishes 
to use.

	Now, more than at any other time in history, we 
are in need of accurate and less complex means of analyzing 
a patient's condition.

	Eighty percent of the diseases treated in this 
country are of a chronic nature.

	The tissue found in chronically afflicted patients 
can be monitored better in the iris of the eye than, 
possibly, by any other method of analysis. 

	Iridology gives an essential insight to the 
development of these chronic diseases or the diminishing 
or the diminishing of that disease or inflammation. 

	It is this tissue change that takes place in the 
patient that makes iridology especially valuable for those 
specializing in the treatment of chronic diseases.

	Iridology is dealing with one of the most basic 
truths of the healing arts, one that the averae form of 
analysis has not dealt with properly.

	With this information, a health program can be 
developed which is tailored to the specific needs of the 
client, thus preventing the manifestation of disease. 

	Iridology in its basic philosophy, stresses the 
treatment of the patient, not the disease. By identifying 
the underlying imbalances in the body that produces symptoms, 
it is an invaluable asset in the formation of remedial 
therapies.

	When one has come to fully appreciate the value of 
being able to determine from the outside of the body what 
is occuring within it, he will realize that iridology is 
truly a science whose time has come.

	The birth about iridology is said to have been 
about 1861.
