Letter From the Editor 

Well,  it's  that  time of year again where we get ready to
send  our  children  off  to  school. I just saw my oldest
manchild  off  to  his 3rd year in college. At age 22 he's
really  a man, but he'll always be my child. So I lovingly
refer to him as my "manchild". One thing Bible College has
taught  him,  is  to  be  tolerant  of  his  mom's  silly
expressions.   His  move  is  a  week  early  because  he
volunteered  to be "Den Mother" for the dorm. So he has to
be  there  in advance for preparation meetings and to help
the first year students settle in. 

Because  of  this  new  responsibility, he won't be able to
come  home  very  often.  So  this is really the last step
before he's officially "flown the coop". As many of you can
relate,  that  makes  mommy  kind of sad... but also proud
because  he  has  turned  into  a  fine  young  man  with
confidence, conviction, and enthusiasm. 

Because  he  won't  be  home regularly, we had to make up a
special  care  package.  A  3  month  supply  of  a  good
multi-vitamin is a must, because I know he won't eat right.
Lots  of  Echinacea to build up his immune system and help
ward  off  the  colds he's likely to get because I know he
won't  eat right. A supply of Garlic capsules to take when
he  catches  a cold because he forgot to take Echinacea to
prevent it because I know he won't eat right. Lavender oil
so  he can put 1 drop on his pillow case just before going
to  bed  for  the  night.  This  will help him fall asleep
easier. He'll need that, especially since he'll be studying
so hard and he'll likely be run down and feeling miserable
with  all the colds he'll get because he'll forget to take
his  Echinacea  and I know he won't eat right. A bottle of
White  Willow  (herbal aspirin) to take care of odd little
pains  and  the  headaches  he  may  get from being overly
stressed  because he feels miserable with his cold that he
got because he forgot to take his Echinacea because I know
he won't eat right. 

Then,   of  course,  there's  the  care  package  of  food
containing  a  2 week supply of all the major food groups.
This is because he'll be so busy when he gets there that he
likely  won't  have  time to get to the store, and I don't
want  him to have an excuse to "not eat right". :) There's
one last thing that I included in his special care package.
An aromatherapy candle that he can light while he does his
homework. It will help him relax so he can soak up all the
information he's studying and remind him that all is right
with the world. 

Best  of health to all of you and your children. Especially
those who are going away from home.

Section 1           Children, Moods and Sugar     
                    by June Kaminski, RN MSN
                 http://www.visionsofadonai.com/ 

Having  a  "sweet  tooth"  is considered a problem for many
reasons.  Sugars   have   been linked with health risks as
varied as weight gain, diabetes and bizarre behavior. 

Sugars are also recognized as one of the building blocks of
life. There are both simple or complex  sugars. All complex
sugars are broken down in the body into simple sugars, and
used  for  a number of different metabolic and nutritional
tasks. There is no doubt about it, sugars are an important 
part  of people's diets. It's just a question of how much,
what  kind and whether there are health risks from  eating
it.  

The   most  common  sugars  are  glucose, sucrose, lactose,
fructose  and  maltose.  These  can  be  found in foods as
diverse as vegetables,  fruits,  grains,  refined  foods, 
milk    and  their  products.   We   also   tend  to  eat
concentrated  sugar  in  white  or  brown   sugar,  honey,
molasses, and corn, maple or other syrups. 

Linked to Hyperactivity? 

In recent years, sugar has been linked with  hyperactivity 
in   children.  Hyperactivity  is  seen  as restlessness, 
irritability,   aggressiveness,  poor  sleeping and short 
attention   spans.   Some studies do seem to suggest this,
while  others refute the claim. Researchers for the US FDA
found that  sugars  were  important for brain activity and
could even calm children. 

This  is  not to say that parents should give their child a
candy bar to calm down. But a natural sugar source such as 
a  sun-ripened  piece  of fruit, or wholesome grain product
could  be  just what they need to lose their 'edgy' feeling
and relax.  

Often,   aggressive  or  "hyper"  behavior is a sign of low
blood   sugar.   Carbohydrates,   including sugars are our
bodies'  main source of energy. Naturally occurring sugars
are  vital  for  our  health.  What  is  not  vital is the
consumption  of highly processed  foods that contain large
amounts of added sugars and other  additives. 

When  only  refined  processed  sugars are eaten, the blood
glucose  tends  to  fall  more  quickly after a meal. As a
result,  our  adrenaline kicks in to compensate. People who
are sensitive  to  lowered  blood sugar may show a tendency
towards  shakiness,  and  nervous,  erratic behavior. They
are irritable until  the  crisis  is  met. In other words,
until they restore their sugar supply. 

If  natural  sources  of  sugar are eaten, this crisis  is 
less likely to happen. The blood glucose stays more stable 
until   the   next  meal. Children are more susceptible to
falling  blood  sugars  than  adults  are.  Thus they need
high quality,  natural  foods  in  their  diets  even more. 

Sugar as a Comforter  

It   is  quite common for food to be seen as a way to make 
us   feel  better. For children and adults alike, the more
coping  skills  we  have  to  deal with distress and moody
feelings,  the   less  likely  that food will be used as a
source  of comfort. Carbohydrates are especially soothing,
since  they  help  the brain to  receive  tryptophan  and 
convert  it to serotonin, a brain chemical  that  makes  us
feel  sleepy and comforted. 

The  more rapidly the sugar in food is absorbed, the faster
it  raises the serotonin  which improves the mood. Glucose
and  sucrose, common in  candies  and  refined  foods  are
the most rapidly absorbed sugars,  while  fructose  is the
slowest. Fructose, abundant in ripe fruit is therefore the
best choice for long-lasting comfort and  calming.  

Nutritious   conscious  child experts suggest that parents 
help   their  children  learn  to self-quiet themselves by
giving  them ample soothing and comfort in loving ways. To
keep  their  sugar levels in balance, give plenty of fresh
fruit, whole grain  baked  (versus  fried)  products,  and 
keep  the  diet  as natural and unrefined as possible. Not
only  for  their  moods,  but their  general  growth  and 
development   as  well.  Sugar  is important,  but keep it
as  simple and natural as possible. Your child  will thank
you for it!

      Iron:  Who  Needs  More,  Who Needs Less, How and Why
			by Dr. John Maher  		 
                 http://www.RxforWellness.com 

In America iron deficiency is surprisingly common. However,
it  is  mostly  among children, teenage girls, women with 
excessive  menstrual flow and the aged. Indeed among most 
mature healthy adults, especially men, iron EXCESS is the 
problem. This is because iron is a PRO-oxidant as compared 
to an anti-oxidant. Indeed, one reason to give blood is to 
LOWER your iron count as an anti-aging measure! This is why
  in my online anti-aging course I recommend an IRON FREE 
multivitamin/mineral. 

Let  me  mention  why the very elderly tend to get anemic. 
Some common reasons are poor appetite, loss of taste/smell,
  difficulty  preparing  foods,  poor  digestion  and poor
dentition.  The  best  iron  food  group  is  meat. Animal
heme-iron is much  more absorbable than vegetable non-heme
iron. (Heme means  blood which is what helps makes red meat
red.)  Oysters,   beef  and  chicken  livers, beef kidney,
shrimp, herring,  sardines, tuna, dark turkey and red meat,
in  that  order,   are the best sources. Among the grains;
bran flakes, wheat  germ and bran and oats flakes are best.
Pumpkin and almonds  are the best nuts and seeds. Lima and
pinto  beans  are quite  high, as are spinach, parsley and
peas.  Apricots, figs,  watermelon, raisins and prunes are
the  best  fruits. Most  vegetables are a poor source with
carrots,  asparagus and  beets the best of the rest of the
group.  Brewers  yeast  and   blackstrap  molasses are old
standbys for vegetarians. 

Taking  just  100 mg of Vit C with your meals can increase 
your  iron  uptake  by  250%!  Tea,  and worse coffee, can
prevent  50% to 80% of the iron from being absorbed. In the
elderly,   supplementing  with  HCL (hydrochloric acid) is
sometimes   needed in order for assimilation of iron to be
possible,  especially iron pills. Many antacid medications
interfere  with iron digestion by making the stomach "less
acid".  It   should  be  noted here that "acid stomach" is
almost never  a stomach that is too acid, rather a stomach
lining that  no longer protects against acid like a healthy
stomach  does,   or  it  is  acid  "refluxing" up into the
unprotected esophagus. 

Your  doctor  can  measure  your iron status quite easily. 
However,  early anemia symptoms will show before a simple 
iron  test  shows  anemia.  Special iron binding capacity 
tests, and iron transferring tests are more accurate.  The
earliest detection will come from darkfield microscopy,  a
special microscope used mostly by alternative practioners. 

Iron  from  a multivitamin can be very difficult to absorb,
especially  the inexpensive brands. So if your fatigued and
not  eating wisely,  don't count on your ONE A DAY to bail
you  out.  Iron  peptonate  and  glycinate are two of more
easily  assimilated  forms.  They are also  less likely to
cause  nausea  and  constipation,  two problems with  iron
pills.

SIDS  Protection  Certain fungal organisims, commonly found
in  baby  mattresses,  can  produce  poisonous  gases from
chemical   compounds  containing  antimony  and  arsenic.
Virtually  all baby mattresses and bedding manufactured in
the United States contain these chemicals. These gases have
been  implicated  in  SIDS.  Therefore  baby   mattresses,
especially those that have been previously used and  likely
contaminated with mildew, significantly increase the risk 
of  SIDS.  The  Babesafe  Cover-designed  by  a New Zeland
chemist  to   fit and completely enclose standard crib and
bassinet  mattresses-  has been slept upon by over 100,000

Section 3                Pounds and Predators              
                          by Danielle Carrie 

When do I get labeled fat, overweight or obese? 

It  is  common knowledge that a certain amount of body fat 
is  needed for heat insulation, energy, shock absorption, 
and to fulfill other important roles in the human body.  In
many  ways men and women are different and weight is  just
another one of our many  differences. 

It is more common for a  woman to have more fat than a man.
Generally  speaking  doctors agree that men exceeding more
than  25 percent body fat and women exceeding more than 30
percent body fat are considered to be obese. 

You  will  find  that  a  woman will typically collect fat 
around the hips and buttocks making her body shape  similar
to the shape of a pear while men tend to build  fat around
the belly area making their body shape more  like an apple.
However this is not carved in stone.  Some men are heavier
in  the hips and buttocks and some women become heavier in
the  belly.  After  menopause  it   is common for women to
become more apple-shaped. 

 When is too much weight dangerous for me? 

Health  problems  associated with obesity have a lot to  do
with  where the fat is located. Fat located mostly  in the
abdomen is a warning sign of future health risks. 

 How do I determine this? 

There  are  ways  to  measure  someone's  body shape. It is
called   "waist-to-hip  ratio".  In  order  to  determine
"waist-to-hip  ratio",  you  must measure the waist at its
smallest  point,  then  measure the hips at their thickest
point.  When  you  have the measurements for the waist and
hips  divide the waist measurement by the hip measurement.
Women with "waist-to-hip ratios" higher  than 0.8 are at an
increased  health  risk.  Men  with "waist-to-hip ratios" 
higher  than 1.0 are also at an increased health risk this
is  because of their fat formation. 

 Am I stuck like this forever? 

Of  course  not!  However, weight is a very sensitive issue
and  it  can be mentally and physically draining leaving a
person  feeling  depressed, stressed and very low in terms
of  their  own  self  esteem.   These are just some of the
toughest obstacles while dealing with  weight loss. Try to
be  honest  with  yourself on what you have eaten  and how
much  exercising  you  have  done  and how you are feeling
today.    I strongly believe that with weight loss you are
the deciding vote.  

Be  careful  of  the weight loss industry. Weight loss does
not  have   any quick fixes especially if you want to lose
the weight naturally,  permanently, and safely. This is not
to say that it cant be done. Believe and you shall achieve! 

I  welcome  any  comments  or questions you have related to
diet  or  weight loss mailto:research@life-choices.com and
put "Diets Don't Work" in the subject heading.

Dear Garlic, 

My  husband  insists  I  look good when we go out together.
This is no problem you would think. I make sure I am colour
coordinated,  make  up  is  perfect  and take lots of time
choosing ascessories, but he doesent like the colours I am
wearing or the jewlery or my shoes. He goes on and on about
it. I ask him what he would like to see me in and he says.
"I  dont know but  I dont like your choices!"  Meanwhile I
have  closets  overflowing  with outfits shoes etc.  He is
making me crazy and plain broke. What can I do with him he
is so hard to please. 

Signed  Well dressed and fed up! 

~~~ 

Dear Well Dressed and Fed Up! 

Well,  you have choices. First and foremost, it is best to 
dress  for  you  and you alone. You are the one who has to
feel  confident  and  comfortable  in  the clothes you are
wearing.   You  could just tell him wear to put it! If you
decide to be  more submissive and please your man (which a
lot  of us do),  you could sell all your clothes, and make
him shop with you  and find clothes you both like together.
That way he would  be invoved in the selection which may be
the  whole problem  to begin with. Frankly if none of that
works,  I  suggest  you   start wearing his clothes, he is
bound to like them!

	    Have You Eaten Your A B C’s Today?  	       
           A Basic Guide to Essential Vitamins                
                     by Kathy Jimenez  	  
               http://www.allhealthnet.com 

 Vitamins  are  organic  substances that assist essential 
biochemical  reactions  within  your  body. Together with 
enzymes,   co-factors,and  other  substances  they  are  
responsible  for normal metabolism,growth and development 
and  regulation  of  cell  function.  There  are 13 known 
vitamins  each  of  which has a specific function that is 
vital  to ones health: four fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E 
and  K) which your body stores in amounts large enough to 
last  for  months and nine water soluble vitamins (C, B1, 
B2,  B6,  B12, niacin, folic acid, biotin and pantothenic 
acid)which  your body is able to store enough to last for 
weeks. 

Vitamin A helps in the formation and maintenance of healthy
teeth, skeletal and soft tissue, mucous membranes, vision 
and skin. A deficiency of vitamin A can result in impaired 
growth  and  development, visual acuity, night vision and 
reduced  resistance  to infections. Yet, excess intake of 
vitamin A can be severely toxic; causing bone pain and loss
of  bone  density, decreased appetite, poor weight gain,
hair   loss,  vomiting  and  anorexia. Infants may develop
symptoms   for  example  resembling  a brain tumor such as
bulging fontanel (soft spot lying between the cranial bones
of  the  skull  of  an  infant), abnormal softening of the
actual skull bones,  swelling of the optic disc and double
vision. 

Vitamin D promotes  the body s absorption of calcium and 
phosphorus  (minerals), which are essential for healthy 
teeth and bones. It also helps maintain the adequate levels
of minerals in the blood. A deficiency of vitamin D causes
imperfect skeletal formation, bone diseases and rickets.
Unnecessary ingestion of vitamin D causes excessive amounts
of  calcium  in  the  blood,  nausea, vomiting, frequent
urination,   extreme thirst, weakness, anxiety and altered
renal function. 

Vitamin E (tocopherol) is important in the formation of red
blood  cells  and  in the use of vitamin K. There are no
known dietary deficiencies of vitamin E or toxic effects
to  mega   doses  of  vitamin  E  other than an occasional
headache. 

Vitamin K is responsible for the coagulation of blood. Its 
deficiency   prolongs   blood-clotting  time  and  causes
hemorrhages.    Large   doses  of  vitamin  K  may  cause
destruction  of  the  membrane  of red blood cells thereby
releasing  hemoglobin,  which  spreads   into  surrounding
fluids and can result in death. In newborns  it may lead to
anemia  and  severe jaundice, which if left  untreated can
result in death as well. 

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is necessary in the formation of 
collagen and maintenance of connective tissue. It promotes 
healthy teeth and gums, aids in the absorption of iron and 
helps the body's immune system. Vitamin C deficiency causes
  scurvy,  anorexia,  anemia,  imperfect prenatal skeletal
formation  and  leads  to  injury to bone, cells and blood
vessels.   High  levels  of  vitamin  C  are toxic and can
significantly   increase  the  levels  of  iron, which can
increase the risk of  heart disease. 

B1  (thiamine)  helps  the body cells convert carbohydrates
into   energy.  It is essential for the functioning of the
heart and  for healthy brain and nerve cells. A deficiency
of  vitamin B1  can leads to fatal diseases of the central
and  peripheral  nervous system, brain disorders and heart
failure. As of yet,  there are no known toxicities. 

B2  (riboflavin)  aids the body in digesting carbohydrates,
fats,  proteins and iron as well. It is important for body
growth  and   red  cell  reproduction.  Lesions around the
mouth,  nose and eyes  as well as sensitivity to light can
indicate  a  deficiency. No symptoms of overdose have been
reported. 

B3  (niacin)  assists in the conversion of food to energy, 
functioning  of  the digestive system, skin and nerves. A 
disease called Pellagra may develop due to a deficiency  or
malabsorption of B3. The disease is characterized by  scaly
skin sores, diarrhea, mucosal changes, and mental  symptoms
(especially   a  schizophrenia-like  dementia).  Niacin  
toxicity  may  cause  changes  in liver function, fatigue,
nausea,  anorexia and decreases functioning of cells in the
body. 

B6  (pyridoxine)  acts  in  production of antibodies in the
immune   system, maintenance of normal brain function, and
functioning   of  red  blood  cells. A deficiency of B6 is
extremely   rare,   however,  large  doses  of  B6  cause
neurological disorders and  numbness. 

Vitamin  B12  assists in the formation of red blood cells, 
metabolism and maintenance of the central nervous system. 
There  have  been  no  reports  of B12 toxicity, however, 
malabsorption and/or insufficiency of B12 may result in a 
fatal form of anemia known as pernicious anemia. 

Biotin   is  essential  for  the  metabolism  of  fat  and
carbohydrates.   Children  with  biotin insufficiency have
retarded  mental  and   physical  development,  hair loss,
impaired immunity and anemia.  In adults, biotin deficiency
may   result   in  anemia,  hair  loss,   lethargy,  high
cholesterol,  nausea,  tingling and numbness of  the hands
and  feet  in  addition  to  mental  symptoms  such  as  
depression,  sleeplessness and hallucinations. No symptoms
of  toxicity have been reported. 

Pantothenic  acid contributes  to  the  synthesis  of
cholesterol and  hormones  and  is  necessary  in  the
metabolism of foods. Deficiency is highly unlikely because
it  is found in abundance  in a variety of foods. The only
reported toxicity is diarrhea. 

Folacin  (folic acid) acts as a coenzyme with vitamins B12 
and  C  in the breakdown of proteins and synthesis of new 
proteins. It is necessary for the production of red blood 
cells and the synthesis of DNA (chemical basis of heredity 
and the carrier of genetic information), as well as tissue 
growth and cell function. Folacin deficiency may cause poor
 growth, graying hair, inflammation of the tongue, mouth 
ulcers, peptic ulcers and diarrhea. It may also result in 
some  forms  of  anemia. High doses of folacin may mask a 
serious condition such as pernicious anemia. 

A  healthy well balanced diet will ensure adequate vitamin 
intake, unless there are impeding health factors involved. 
Vitamins  derived from sources other than foods such as a 
vitamin supplement need to be taken with caution. Excessive
 or  unnecessary amounts can result in an overdose, which
can  be  hazardous  to  ones  health  and  even  fatal.
Cardiologist  Isadore  Rosenfeld  of  New York City says,
Vitamins (vitamin supplements) are medicines like anything
else and in every  medicine there is a little poison. 

Most specialists feel that a daily multi-vitamin supplement
is  safe to take being that it has controlled levels of 
vitamins.  However,  the  American  Dietetic  Association 
recommends skipping pills altogether and suggests getting 
vitamins through a low-fat diet high in fruits, vegetables 
and complex carbohydrates. 

Make  sure to visit your doctor for a medical evaluation if
you feel that you may have a vitamin deficiency. Symptoms
of a vitamin deficiency alone do not confirm a deficiency.
There are  certain tests that need to be performed in order
to  determine whether a vitamin deficiency indeed exists.
Eating a well balanced diet will ensure that you have all
of  the  vitamins  your  body needs. If you wish to have a
little extra assurance, take a multi-vitamin. However,
always ask your doctor or certified nutritionist first.
