====================                               issue 12 

                        Letter from the Editor 

	Since we've changed hosts Your Life-Your Choice
has experienced some technical "settling in" difficulties.
This has caused some delays in transmission, so now we're 
attempting to get caught up. Everything seems to be working
smoothly now. Many thanks to Phil from Oaknet Publishing 
who put in a great amount of effort to get us up to speed.

	In our last issue, some of the measurements in Cary's 
Recipe did not print out correctly. No, they weren't meant 
to be a part of a secret recipe. :) My deepest apologies for 
this mishap. I've included the recipe again in this issue 
with the correct measurements. Many thanks to those who 
brought it to my attention.

	Due to a personal situation the Aromatherapy segment 
has been postponed. Your Life-Your Choice is tentatively 
planning to resume this segment in September's issue.

Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

I've been taking Bee Pollen Granules for 5 months and 
will continuously supplement my diet with this 
powerhouse herb. I instantly noticed an increase in 
energy. Bee Pollen has been extremely beneficial in 
the gym enabling me to take my training to a higher 
level. I've set a personal record in the gym for high 
rep squats while using the granules for just one week.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

I'm 12 years old and I have microcephalia. In October 
I had a severe throat infection bordering on pneumonia. 
I have been on medication all my life and lots of 
antibotics. This time I was at my Gramma and Grampa's. 
They looked after me for one week and my aunt convinced 
them to put me on herbs. Gramma gave me an Elderberry 
extract. I was very sore and had a hard time swallowing 
it. I never swallow my food quickly so it was in my mouth 
for a few moments. I didn't take more than about 2 tsp 
throughout the day and I was back swallowing without pain.

Section 3                  Holistic Dowsing 
                           By Joe Mullally 

Part 3 - Lists, charts and witnesses.

Once we know our YES and NO and DON'T KNOW pendulum responses, 
we can use the device to provide answers to any questions we 
choose to put, always providing that such questions are framed 
so that they elicit a straight 'yes' or 'no' reply. This 
arrangement works fine in many circumstances, though it 
obviously places restrictions on the range of information we 
may receive. Using the pendulum on it's own in this way, we 
have no problem for example, finding out if a particular food
is causing a specific allergic reaction - for the answer to 
this question is either 'yes' or 'no'. However, if we wish to 
ask more broadly - 'which' substance is causing an allergic 
reaction?' - it is not possible for the pendulum, working on 
it's own to give us the answer here. To extend the range of 
information accessible through dowsing, we use various lists, 
charts and samples in conjunction with the pendulum itself. 

As a dowser, one becomes an avid collector of charts and lists 
in one's particular area of interest. Lists of homeopathic 
remedies, flower essences, food substances, etc., become
invaluable aids to our work. There are just a few simple rules 
for using such lists. The first thing to remember, is to 
progress from the 'general' to the 'particular'. In this way, 
we typically start our questioning by going down a list of 
general headings. We will use a simple allergy test method as 
our example here, but please remember that these principles can 
also be applied to any other area of questioning which might be 
your own particular interest. Our general headings list would 
typically consist of the names of all the various areas from 
where any allergy problem might arise, eg. foodstuff, clothing, 
home living environment, work living environment, etc. 

The second thing to keep in mind, is that we should check that 
we are, in fact, on the right track here to begin with, by 
asking the pendulum for a simple 'yes' or 'no' to indicate 
that at least one of the titles on the list we intend to use, 
is actually connected to the problem on which we are working. 
Having received a 'yes' to this, we may proceed to go down the 
list with a pointer held in our 'free hand' as our pendulum 
swings in our NEUTRAL response, in the other. When the pointer 
comes to the list item connected with the allergy, our pendulum 
changes to give us a YES response. We should note this, and
then continue moving the pointer on down though the remainder 
of the list, in the same way. This is the third important point, 
for more than just one item on the list may be connected to the 
problem. Always go down the whole list. After this stage is 
completed, we move on to search more detailed charts for the 
areas indicated, to elicit the most accurate and specific 
information we can, on the issue to hand. For example ... 
general list (indicated foodstuffs) ... foodstuffs list 
(indicated cheeses) ... cheeses list (indicated cheddar) ... 
cheddar list (indicated ABC brand, by WXYZ Manufacturer).  

In addition to these lists of various kinds, pie charts and 
scales can also be consulted to give us 'quantity/percentage/
quality' information - contributing greatly to the range of 
'feedback' we get through dowsing. 

For instance, before starting a healing session with a client, 
we might dowse their general health on a scale of 1 to 50. 
Typically this might yield an answer of, say 25. At the end 
of the session, we can dowse the health level once more and 
we should find it has significantly increased, even fully up 
to 10. This provides important feedback for us and additional 
welcome reassurance to the client themselves. And in cases of 
'absent healing' work, carrying out the above checks is even 
more useful, since in these circumstances, we are not in 
visual contact with the client.

This leads us on nicely to the next issue in dowsing - for to 
ensure we remain focused on the 'target' of our attention (eg. 
the client for whom we are working) we need a representation 
of that target with us as we work. Such representations are 
referred to as 'witnesses' in dowsing phraseology. A witness 
then is a sample of the substance (or client) with whom we are 
working. Having such a witness with us as we work attunes us 
subconsciously to it/the person so we may devote all our 
conscious attention to the work in hand, without the need to
continuously keep in mind who we are working for. This link 
is taken care of by the subconscious tuning in to the witness 
automatically. If the person themselves is present then, 
obviously, they are themselves the witness. For other 
situations, witnesses are broadly classed into three 
categories namely, first, second, and third degree witnesses. 
The higher the degree of the witness (first being strongest) 
the easier it is to get a strong connection with the client 
from it. First degree witnesses are items 'of' the person. 
Here we are talking of a lock of hair, sample of urine or 
other body fluid, etc. A second degree witness is something 
'belonging' to the person - this category includes, items of 
clothing (not washed since last worn), favourite possessions 
(kept about the person a lot), sample of handwriting etc.
Third degree witnesses are 'representations' of the person 
- these would include photographs or voice recordings etc. 

When one has completed their treatment/work for a client I 
strongly advise that any samples or witnesses be either 
discarded in a proper manner or returned to the client as 
appropriate. Doing this acts as a practical demonstration 
that the work is now completed, while failing to do so, in 
my view, can cause links (albeit subtle ones) to be maintained 
between the dowser and the client. Remember that it is the
subconscious we are dealing with here. Carrying out these simple
procedures demonstrates to it that our work is completed, 
otherwise, in many cases, the client may be always waiting 
'uneasily' for the witness to be returned, just as we sometimes 
do when we loan out a favourite book and it takes longer than 
anticipated to come home again.

In the final part of this series we will touch on other 
fascinating topics including charging for work, ethics, 
guides and angels, and the 'virtual' pendulum.

Section 5   Live a Longer and Healthier Life
 			by Herlan Westra 

 An unexpected research finding with great practical
 significance is that experimental animals live longer with
 much lower rates of disease when they consume less than
 the recommended daily allowance of calories. The finding is
 unexpected because we associate less-than-optimal nutrition
 with poor growth and health, and common sense tells us that
 we do better if we are well nourished. In fact, most of us
 may be overnourished, and too much of a good thing may be
 doing us harm.

 An adequate diet is one that provides not only enough
 calories but also all of the nutrients necessary for efficient
 metabolism without any excesses that promote disease. What
 constitutes a good diet is a matter of controversy, and much
 of the controversy is based on emotion rather than reason.

 An average person needs less than 2,000 calories daily, with
 300 to 400 of the calories coming from fat. Present labeling
 laws are helpful in determining your caloric intake, but
 maintaining your weight or losing weight is much more
 complicated. The FDA supports two ways to diet: increase
 exercise and decrease the intake of food.

 Dieting Can Make You Fat 

 That's it? The secret to a long and healthy life is diet and
 exercise? Not really! Metabolism slows down during a diet,
 and the body burns fewer calories, causing more fat to be
 stored as a protection against extended "famine." When the
 food supply is restored, the metabolism is slow to respond,
 and the body stores even more fat. In humans, this yo-yo
 phenomenon is harmful - starvation diets simply fool the
 body into starting a famine cycle. Once the diet is over, we
 are back to where we started, or worse.

 Granted, exercise programs help keep the metabolism active,
 but most of us are about as committed to our exercise
 programs as we are to our diets. We fall off the exercise
 program at the same time we end the diet, increasing the
 yo-yo effect. Then how should we combine dieting and
 exercise into a healthy life?

 First we need to modify our diets, lowering caloric content
 without greatly reducing the amount or the appeal of food
 we consume. The best way of lowering caloric content is by
 cutting the fat content in our diets. Fat has almost twice as
 many calories per gram as protein and carbohydrate.

 Second we need to restrict caloric intake either by fasting or
 by eating a limited diet one day a week. Our body's
 metabolism will not react quick enough to begin a "famine"
 cycle during a one-day diet. Fasting should include plenty of
 liquids, with enough fruit juices to maintain a minimum
 caloric intake. When fasting, reduce the intake of
 supplemental vitamins and minerals, as some supplements
 may become toxic if not consumed with adequate amounts
 of food.

 Vitamin Supplements 

 Our bodies don't benefit from the food we eat, but rather by
 what is digested, assimilated and eliminated. The food is
 taken in, broken into smaller and smaller parts until it can be
 absorbed and the by-products discarded. Enzymes digest all
 of our food and make it small enough to pass through the
 intestines into the blood. Enzymes are a part of every
 metabolic process in the body, from the working of our
 glands to the proper functioning of our immune system.
 Enzymes require vitamins and minerals to do their work.

 Many manufactured vitamin and mineral supplements,
 because they are fractionated (broken down into basic
 elements), are treated as toxic waste in the body. Some
 minerals in an unnatural form can accumulate and cause
 harmful effects. Fortunately, many commercial vitamin and
 mineral supplements are so badly formulated that they pass
 right through our digestive systems without breaking down
 and being absorbed. Unfortunately, we haven't received the
 benefit that we paid for.

 Many people are now using all-natural herbal forms of
 vitamin and mineral supplements. Because these are in a
 natural form, they are more easily absorbed than
 manufactured supplements. They are also much less
 concentrated than manufactured supplements, and so are
 often safer. However, it is always best to consult with your
 personal physician before taking any nutritional supplement.

 The proper supplements, combined with proper diet and
 exercise, can help you live a longer and healthier life.
