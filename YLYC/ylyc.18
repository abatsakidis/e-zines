Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

In my youth I was very active in sports, specifically 
racquetball. Although it has been years since I played, 
I decided it was time to get back into it. Realizing 
that I would suffer from stiff and sore muscles for at 
least 2 days afterward (while finding out just how out 
of shape I really was), I thought I would try some 
preventative measures. I used a mixture of White Oak 
Bark, Mullein, Black Walnut Hulls, and Queen of the 
Meadow. I took this concoction that evening and for the 
next 3 days. I was actually amazed at the results. No 
stiffness, no sore, aching muscles, none of the normal 
punishments for pushing a maturing body to its limits.

Cindy

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I used to get sick on a very regular basis; colds, flus, 
upset stomachs, and the like. I started taking blue/green 
algae at the advice of a friend. Now I'm not sick nearly 
as often. 

David

Section 3    		A Myriad of Options

			By Brigitte Synesael

Having found a line of herbal combinations specially 
formulated by top scientists in North America to provide 
optimum results, Brigitte has spent the past 3 years 
promoting wellness through the use of herbal
supplementation. Further details can be found at:
http://www.Life-choices.com/herbal/.
Being the editor of Your Life-Your Choice has opened up 
Brigitte's awareness and strengthened her conviction to 
many types of alternative and complementary therapies. 
The Your Life-Your Choice Headquarters contains many 
informative opportunities and can be found at 
http://www.Life-Choices.com.
----------

	This is the second of a series of articles designed 
to be used as a resource or a starting ground in determining 
which alternative/complementary treatment will benefit 
you. Most of the commonly recognized modalities are 
briefly described here. Remember, this is a brief 
description. Often we will not be able to do justice to the 
therapy in question in such a limited amount of space. 
This resource is meant to educate you as to the numerous 
options available. YOU are the one who is empowered to 
take control over your health on a going forward basis. 
Remember, too, that the onus is upon the individual to 
ensure that the practitioner you choose is properly 
qualified and possesses the required certification for your 
area.

Bach Flower Remedies - This system was developed by 
Dr. Edward Bach, hence the name; Bach Flower 
Remedies.  By using flowers, buds, and twigs Bach 
designed numerous flower essences beneficial in 
balancing moods and specific mind states. This treatment 
is claimed to be very beneficial in alleviating stressful 
conditions.

Biofeedback--A technique of monitoring the unconscious 
body's reactions to stress to provide immediate 
information to the conscious mind. Through guided 
imagery and relaxation techniques the individual can 
learn to control the unconscious thus exercising control 
over reactions and restoring balance. This technique is 
recommended for chronic pain, tension headaches, 
neuromuscular challenges, depression, anxiety, and 
similar health issues.

Chakra - In an ancient Indian language Chakra means 
"wheel". Chakras are force centers of spiritual power 
which flows throughout the body. There is a discrepancy 
as to how many Chakras exist. Some say 5 and others 
believe there is as many as 10. Chakras correspond with 
specific areas of the body. The Chakras or wheels 
continuously rotate, receiving and redirecting energies 
which ultimately results in appropriate balance and 
restored health.

Chiropractic - This is the diagnosis and manipulative 
treatment of the functional disorders of the joints, in 
particular injuries related to the spine. Misalignments 
of the vertebra along the spinal cord interfere with nerves, 
muscle tissues, joints, glands, etc. and interfere with their 
function. The manipulative movements to correct these 
misalignments helps the body regain its structure and its 
function. 

Colon Hydrotherapy - This is a process of removing 
excess fecal material from the colon walls. As well as 
removing impacted wastes, it dilutes  bacteria and 
toxins from the large intestines and the colon. Benefits of 
this treatment include improved muscle tone, an increase 
in the absorption of nutrients, and reducing the absorption 
of toxic waste material. Colonics are an essential part of a 
holistic detoxification program. This treatment is 
recommended for these health concerns: headaches, 
candida, constipation, parasites, malabsorption syndrome, 
bad breath and for general health. 

Craniosacral Therapy - This technique addresses the 
functioning of the Craniosacral system which is 
comprised of the brain, the spinal cord, cerebrospinal 
fluid, cranial dual membrane, cranial bones and the 
sacrum. Gentle, non-invasive manipulation allows the 
practitioner to make adjustments to free the body from 
tensions and restrictions within the central nervous 
system. This technique is particularly effective in 
addressing headaches, TMJ, myofascial challenges, and 
similar health issues.

Ear Candling - A specially designed, hollow cloth candle 
is inserted into the ear. Once lit it creates a vacuum that 
draws out excess ear wax, Candida, fungus, bacteria, 
viruses, etc. from the ears and sinuses. 
CAUTION:  This can be a very dangerous procedure. DO 
NOT attempt this on your own. Make sure that only a 
qualified professional administers this treatment. 

Herbology - An ancient healing art that relies on the use 
of herbs (parts of plants) as the source of remedies for 
specific health issues. Herbology works on the principal 
that given the proper tools (vitamins, nutrients, etc.) the 
body can heal itself. Often certain herbs will compliment 
each other. The proper combination can significantly 
increase the efficacy of a particular mixture. Herbology is 
the oldest system of medicine practiced and is used in 
conjunction with a number of other modalities. Each herb, 
having different healing properties, is used to strengthen 
the natural functions and systems of the body without the 
undesirable side effects that accompany many 
prescription drugs. Good quality herbs can be beneficial 
in addressing virtually any health condition.

Homeopathy--Based on Samuel Hahnemann's science, the 
theory for this modality is "like cures like". The meaning 
of this is that although large doses of a substance may 
cause symptoms or disease, infinitely small doses of the 
same substance will provide a cure. The entire person is 
taken into consideration prior to determining  treatment. 
Small doses of specially prepared plants and minerals 
help stimulate the body's defenses and encourage the 
healing process. This modality is said to be beneficial in 
dealing with most health issues.

 Hypnosis - A technique where the therapist induces a 
state of deep relaxation, and through positive affirmations 
initiates the desired results. In this relaxed state (trance) 
the subject is highly responsive to suggestions. However, 
the subject cannot be made to follow instructions 
conflicting with their ethics or moral fiber. The British 
and American Medical Associations have accepted 
hypnosis as a viable practice in alleviating a wide range of 
physical and mental conditions. Hypnosis is particularly 
effective in achieving results with stress, addictions, and  
resolving many deep troubling issues.


Once again we have exhausted our space limitation for this 
issue, we will continue exploring Alternative/Complementary 
Therapies in upcoming issues. Just a reminder that this 
is for educational purposes only, and Your Life-Your Choice 
does not endorse any specific modality. As always we 
encourage you to consult your doctor and/or a certified 
practitioner in your area.

Section 5   		Basic Home Herbal Kit

			by Marian Brown, CH
                    Health & Healing News
			http://www.hhnews.com

In addition to daily nutritional supplements, it is not a 
bad idea to keep on hand some basic herbs to help out in 
special situations. Having them handy makes it possible 
to give an immediate "boost" to fighting off a cold, flu, 
or stomach ache, rather than waiting the few hours it make 
take to make a special trip to the store. 

Catnip--This herb isn't just for your cat! Scientist have 
confirmed the traditional use of catnip as a digestive aid. 
It is believed to soothe the muscles of the digestive tract 
and cleanse the bowel. This herb is very handy to have on 
hand for Halloween!

Garlic--Not just for scaring away those Halloween vampires, 
garlic is a must for the herbal remedy kit. It has been 
called "nature's penicillin" and is traditionally used for 
its anti-bacterial properties. It has been used for 
centuries to fight colds, fevers, and respiratory 
infections. Garlic oil (also in capsules) can be easily 
rubbed on the back and chest to help break up respiratory
congestion. I have also seen it applied to the soles of 
the feet with the same effect! A few drops of slightly warm 
garlic oil can also be placed in the ear to help elevate 
earaches. Many users of garlic take it every day for its 
reported preventative properties during the cold/flu seasons.

Echinacea--One of the most well-known of the immune-boosters, 
Echinacea can be used before, during, or after a bout with 
an illness. It is believed to "rev" up the immune system to 
protect against infections, as well as build it up after. 

EyeBright--Since prevention may not be 100%, herbs can help 
to lesson and ease the symptoms. For the runny, scratchy, 
puffy eyes that often accompany the cold, eyebright can be 
very useful. Taken internally, it can help relief these 
symptoms and also many believe it strengthens the eyes.
(This may be helpful for "back to school" eyestrain some 
children experience after not reading a lot during the 
summer.) In addition to the capsule form, there are many 
herbal eyewashes that contain eyebright to help soothe 
more severe problems.

White willow bark--Known as the "aspirin" of the herb 
world, it can be used for a wide-range of ailments. It is 
commonly used for aches and pains of colds/flu or muscle 
strain and for bringing down fevers. 

Feverfew--As the name implies, feverfew can be used to 
help relieve fevers, but is also an excellent headache 
remedy. Modern herbalists even recommend feverfew to help 
combat migraine attacks. 

This is just a sampling of the many herbs available to 
help us control and maintain our daily health. Be sure to 
read and FOLLOW label directions or consult a qualified 
health care practitioner when administering herbs. If 
symptoms persist or increase, be sure to consult your 
health care provider.

6.			Aromatherapy:SAD

		 	 By Marge Clark
		 http://www.naturesgift.com

I first came in contact with the essential oils perhaps 15 
years ago. Their healing power awed and fascinated me from 
the start. Several years of study and experimentation with 
the essential oils followed. The founding of Nature's Gift 
Custom Aromatherapy Products followed. I am really delighted 
that the internet gives me a venue to learn from others, and 
to share what I've learned.

----- 

As the hours of sunshine dwindle, and the gray days of 
November follow one after another, many of my friends 
complain of depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, 
what may be a natural biological response to the dark
days of winter. Our bodies know that this is a time 
for huddling around the fire in the cave, and not 
undertaking unnecessary tasks. However, our modern 
society demands that we continue the demands placed 
upon us and lead fuller busier lives than our bodies 
would choose.

In total honesty, the best remedy I have seen for SAD 
is exposure to full spectrum light banks, and for 
someone who truly suffers from the disorder to the 
extent that he/she is unable to function, the investment 
in the special lighting is a worthwhile expenditure.

However, aromatherapy, with its deep effect on the spirit 
and on the emotions, may be very helpful. This is the 
time of year to bring out the Citrus Essential Oils. The 
full range of citrus oils are uplifting; I call them the 
smile bringers. I do have some personal favorites, however, 
and love to share about them. Generally, the citrus oils 
are cold pressed from the rind of the fruit. Please be 
aware that all of them are to one degree or another 
photosentizers. Do not apply to the skin and then expose 
yourself to ultraviolet rays, whether outside, with a 
tanning bed, or in any other form, for at least 12 hours.

In the morning, on gray days that I want to curl up under 
the covers, I reach for Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil. 
Pink Grapefruit is a wonderful energizer. It makes me want 
to get up and out, to wash windows, strip wallpaper, do 
yardwork, etc. I like to diffuse it in a nebulizing diffuser, 
but a few drops in warm water in an aromalamp, warmed by a 
tea candle, or inhaled from a tissue, or even mixed in a spray 
bottle with water and spritzed in the air will work. If I am 
not going to be going outside, I might add five or six drops 
of Pink Grapefruit to a salt scrub before my morning shower.  
For diffusion in the air, I like to add a little Cypress 
Essential Oil to the Pink Grapefruit; I call that my 
"FogCutter" blend.

Orange Essential Oil is another energizer, but gentler in 
its effect; perhaps better to use in a household full of 
children. It is impossible to be gloomy, contrary or cranky 
with the scent of orange in the air. Another essential oil 
that can work wonders with a roomful of cranky, housebound
children is Tangerine. Sweet-scented, it seems to banish 
contrary spirits on the fourth rainy day in a row.

Another oil that seems to banish the blues for many people 
is Bergamot. This essential oil is gentler, with a touch 
of floral in its scent. I will only use Bergamot in an 
airborne blend. It is the most phototoxic essential oil; 
you do not want to risk exposure to UV rays with Bergamot 
on your skin.  

For uplifting the spirits without necessarily energizing, 
splurge and indulge in some Neroli. This steam distilled 
oil from the flowers of the Bitter Orange tree is a 
wonderfully uplifting oil, that soothes rather than energizes.  
A few drops blended into an unscented cream or lotion or in
Jojoba Oil to give you a personal perfume blend can keep you 
serene throughout the storms of early winter.

Remember that all of the citrus oils have the potential to 
cause sun sensitivity, and to irritate sensitive skin.  
If applying the citrus oils to your body, please dilute 
them in a weak dilution, ie, 10 drops to one ounce of carrier 
oil. Less is definitely more in this case. But with safe and 
appropriate use, the ecitrus smilebringers' can beat the 
winter doldrums!

Until next time, have an aromatic month!

Section 2           Choice Tidbits

In general, the more brightly colored a fruit
or vegetable is, the more vitamins and
phytonutrients it contains. Also, raw fruits
and vegetables usually contain more health
supporting enzymes than cooked ones. When 
in doubt, go for bright and raw!

You can *super-charge* your metabolism for weight 
loss by doing some type of aerobic exercise on a daily 
basis...walking, swimming, jogging, aerobic dance, 
stationary cycling, bike riding, rowing, stair climbing,
etc. Folks, forget this "twice a week" stuff. Our bodies
were designed to be active everyday! Try to average 30
to 45 minutes per day, but do something *everyday*... 
even if it's only 10 minutes some days. This will turn on
your "fat burning switch"! Give it a try... your 
metabolism will soar!!   :)

Section 3    "Everything You Always Wanted to Know 
				About Magnets,
			But Did Not Know Whom to Ask."

			By Dr. Boyce N. Berkel

This report is written by Boyce N. Berkel, M.D. It was 
condensed and adapted by permission from Dr. William H. 
Philpotts book "Biomagnetic Handbook." Dr. Philpott is 
currently doing FDA approved research in Magnetic 
Therapy, and is taking applications. For more information 
on this timely and very fascinating subject, go to 
http://www.i-netmall.com/shops/relief/
~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you understand that you are a magnetic being, 
exposed to and affected by electromagnetic radiation. 
And now that you know you can be protected by negative 
magnetic energy, you may be wondering... "What magnets 
should I use? And how should I use them? 

In this issue you will learn about the various kinds 
of magnets. You will learn about their strengths, their 
degree  of penetration, and how to use them effectively. 

You will see the term "Gauss" used from time to time. It 
is simply a unit of magnetic field intensity, and 
represents the number of lines of magnetic force passing 
through an area of 1 square centimeter. 

At the earth's surface, the magnetic field is about 0.5 
gauss. A standard refrigerator magnet measures about 200 
gauss. Therapeutic magnets may range from 2450 gauss to 
5000 gauss, and industrial strength electromagnetic fields 
often measure more than 20,000 gauss. 

Except for the precautions mentioned at the end of this 
news letter, magnets are safe to use. In fact, the application 
of static magnetic energy to humans has been approved by the 
FDA which, based on toxicity studies, has been clarified as 
"not essentially harmful." The magnetic fields of magnetic 
instruments cleared by the FDA for human application and 
industrial static magnets are identical. 

You have found out so far why it is important to always use 
a negative magnetic field! 


			MINI-BLOCK CERAMIC MAGNETS

They can be used on your head such as your temporal 
areas, frontal or occipital areas for headaches or 
management of emotional symptoms or seizures. They can 
be used on your fingers or toes. They can be used directly 
on your joints, under or incorporated into wraps around 
your joints. 

They can be placed on top of the Flexible Mats to reinforce 
the depth of magnetic field penetration. They are used in 
the Magnetic Mattress Pad, the Multi-Purpose Pads and the 
Magnetic Chair Pads. 

They are 1 7/8 x 7/8 x 3/8 inch with a manufacturers gauss 
rating of 3950. 


			CERAMIC DISC MAGNETS

They serve numerous valuable purposes such as around 
your head to treat headaches or other central nervous 
system symptoms, around your joints, and over lesions on 
your skin or subcutaneous tissues. 

The magnetic field of a Ceramic Disc extends to eight 
inches. The therapeutic value extends to about three inches. 

They are 1½ x 3/8 inch, with a manufacturers gauss rating 
of 3950. 

				CERAMIC BLOCK MAGNETS

The 4 x 6 x ½: inch Ceramic Block can be used around 
your joints, or to penetrate deeply into your liver, your 
internal organs, your heart, or into your head for the 
treatment of tumors. 

The magnetic field extends to twelve inches. The 
therapeutic value extends for 6-7 inches. They have a 
manufacturers gauss rating if 3950. 

A Ceramic Block Magnet that is 4 x 6 x 1 inch has a 
magnetic field extending to 19 inches with a therapeutic 
value extending to nine inches. 

The 4 x 6 x 1 inch Ceramic Block Magnets are used in the 
Vitality Sleeper to have a field that penetrates into the head
during sleep, for the production of melatonin. This is the 
age-reversing, disease-fighting, sleep-enhancing hormone. 

			MULTI-MAGNET FLEXIBLE MATS

The flexibility if these mats makes them very useful since 
they will fit around the curves of your body, without 
producing any pressure. 

They are composed of plastiform magnet strips 1½ x 7/8 x 
1/8 inch with a manufacturers gauss rating of 2450. 

These plastiform magnetic strips are placed in four rows 
with the 1½ inches lengthwise the pad. In a 5 x 6 inch mat 
there are twelve magnetic strips. In a 5 x 12 inch mat, there 
are 24 magnetic strips. 

With the Multi-Magnet Flexible Mats, the magnetic field 
extends to seven inches. However, the therapeutic level 
extends about two inches. When the Flexible Mat is reinforced 
with one row of Mini-Block Magnets placed in the two central 
rows of magnets in the mat, the magnetic field extends to ten 
inches with the therapeutic field extending to four inches. 
When there are two rows of Mini-Block Magnets on the mat, the 
therapeutic level extends to five inches. 

The Flexible Mat can be re-inforced with Mini-Block 
Magnets placed crosswise the two inner rows of plastiform 
magnets in the flexible mat. This places the Mini-Block 
Magnets an inch and one half apart in which there are three 
placed on the 5 x 6 inch mat and six placed on the 5 x 12 
inch mat. The Flexible Mat can also be reinforced by the 4 
x 6 x ½ inch Ceramic Block Magnet. This extends the 
therapeutic value to six inches. 

			THE MULTI-PURPOSE PAD

Can be used on your back, your abdomen, or up over your 
heart and chest. 

It is 14 x 25 inches and composed of Mini-Block Magnets 
that are placed an inch and one-half apart throughout the 
pad. 


			A MAGNETIC MATTRESS PAD

Besides improving your general health, you will get the 
best relaxing sleep of your life. 

It is composed of Mini-Block Magnets that are placed an 
inch and one-half apart throughout the pad. 

An eggcrate type foam pad or other suitable pad should be 
placed over this Mattress Pad. By doing so, it provides a 
full negative magnetic field. It is this negative field that 
gives you all the long-term benefits of Magnetic Therapy. 

			THE VITALITY SLEEPER

This is designed to promote the production of melatonin by 
your pineal gland. This gland is located near the top and 
center of your head. Melatonin will increase your energy, 
improve your general health and enhance your sex life. 

It is composed of four Ceramic Blocks that are 4 x 6 x 1 
inch placed in a row ¾ inch apart. These Ceramic Blocks 
are placed upright in a wooden carrier that holds them 
firmly up against the headboard. They can be raised or 
lowered depending on the height of the pillow. 

They are shipped at the top of the carrier and need to be 
lowered so that the head is in the. magnetic field. They are 
resting on a wooden dowel. The wooden dowel they are 
resting on should be slightly below the back of the head 
when the head is on the pillow. It is designed that the top of 
the head should be approximately three inches from these 
magnets. By doing so, it provides a full negative magnetic 
effect, of stimulting the pineal gland to produce melatonin. 

			The MAGNETIC CHAIR PAD

Gives you relief from back and leg pains. It will fit easily 
into your car, office chair, or favorite chair at home. 

It is composed of Mini-Block Magnets placed an inch and 
one-half apart throughout the seat and the back of the pad.

				PRECAUTIONS	

DO NOT use magnets on the abdomen during PREGNANCY 
DO NOT use a magnetic bed or magnets on your chest if wearing a 
PACEMAKER or DEFIBRILLATOR. A magnet within a few inches 
of these instruments can interrupt their function. 
DO NOT use a magnetic bed for 24 hours daily if ill. This could 
suppress your adrenal glands, resulting in slow energy recovery. The 
magnetic bed may be used 8 - 10 hours per day, and then supplemented 
with spot therapy for specific symptoms. 
DO NOT use magnets on the abdomen for 60 - 90 minutes following 
meals. This allows peristalsis to take place. 
DO NOT use positive magnetic energy on a prolonged basis unless 
under medical supervision. 


DISCLAIMER

What you have learned here is educational, and not to be 
construed as medical advice, diagnosis, or self-help 
prescription for any individual or any specific problem. 
Any person experiencing a health problem should consult a 
physician. Unsupervised self treatment could be hazardous 
in cases of serious illness. You must know also that there 
are no ethical restrictions on the self-help application 
of magnets, nor are there ethical restrictions on the 
purchase of magnets for whatever use a person wishes to 
use them. There is no ethical restriction reviewing 
information on how to apply magnets for human therapeutics, 
as long as no claim for a cure is made. The self-help 
application of magnetic fields is the sole responsibility 
of the self-help applier. 

Without promise of a cure, magnetic therapy is worth a try.

Section 5   	 ADD: Is There Life After Ritalin?
		Part IV of "The Dilemma of ADD/ADHD"
		
			By Joe Carr, Ph.D., C.N.C.

Dr. Joe Carr is a Psychologist, Certified Nutritional 
Counselor and Certified Microscopist Technician. He is 
currently completing his dissertation for a doctorate of 
Naturopathy, is a member of the International Society of
Orthomolecular Medicine, the American Nutraceutical 
Association, the American Academy of Environmental 
Medicine, and the American Association of Nutritional
Consultants. He is a partner in Wellness Therapies, a 
wellness clinic in St. Louis, MO and specializes in 
working with children who have been diagnosed as ADD/ADHD. 
He employs a completely natural approach to the problem of 
ADD and can be contacted at wellness@primary.net.
~~~~~~~~~~

In our last installment of this series, we will look at 
some of the alternatives that are available to us in 
treating ADD.

So, what's a parent to do? We love our child, we want the 
best for them, we want to help them but this ADD-thing
keeps getting in the way. Isn't there anything else we can 
do besides just giving them drugs?

Fortunately, the answer is a hearty "Yes!" It does not 
matter if your child is taking a drug or not; the following
suggestions or tips can be used by all. Moreover, obviously, 
this is not a complete or exhaustive list. There are many 
good books available that deal with additional supplementation,
psychological and educational assistance.

1 - Start keeping a food diary. Often a child diagnosed as 
ADD has food sensitivities and allergies that contribute to 
the problem or are actually THE cause of the problem. A food 
diary enables you to start seeing a pattern that might exist. 
It is quite simple: note the child's behavior before breakfast, 
after breakfast, after lunch, dinner and any snacks (the only 
time BEFORE is breakfast) such as irritable, runny nose, cough, 
stomach problems, normal, etc. Also, write down EVERYTHING that 
was eaten. Patterns can sometimes quickly present themselves; 
usually you will need at least a month of information before 
sensitivities become obvious. As patterns develop (e.g. each 
time the child eats sweets he becomes irritable and 
argumentative), you can remove that item from the diet for a 
week or two and notice if the behavior returns. Then reintroduce 
the food and pay close attention to what happens. With this in 
mind, I offer the next tip:

2 - Utilize the resources of the Feingold Association.
Pediatrician-allergist Benjamin Feingold, M.D. developed the 
Feingold Program in the early 1970s to identify the chemical 
to which most ADD children are sensitized. A recent university-
sponsored study involving 170 families using the program showed
wide-ranging improvements in such diverse areas as more compliant 
response to parental discipline, decreased truancy, and better 
ability to get to sleep. Their web page address is:
http://www.feingold.org/indexx.html

3 - Consider supplementing with an OPC or pycnogenol. Jacques 
Masquelier coined the word Pycnogenol to describe an entire 
class of bioflavonoids that are composed of polyphenols, or 
Proanthocyanidin complexes, also referred to as Oligomeric
Proanthocyanidin Complexes (OPCs). Masquelier patented a 
process to extract Proanthocyanidin from both pine bark in
1951, and grape seeds in 1970. The name Pycnogenol, was intended 
as a scientific name for this class of bioflavanoids, whether 
extracted from pine bark, lemon tree bark, grape seeds, grape 
skins, cranberries, etc. I'm not concerned on WHAT it is called, 
rather on using it. OPC, Proanthocyanidin, Pycnogenol - have a 
generalized calming effect and can significantly increase mental 
alertness and ability to stay focused. It appears to assist in 
decreasing aggressiveness and impulsiveness.

4 - Begin using a good digestive enzyme formula. Enzymes are 
involved in every aspect of our lives. They move our muscles, 
stimulate our nerves, make our heart beat, keep us breathing 
and even enable us to think. There are literally hundreds of 
thousands of enzymes active in every organ, tissue and fluid 
of your body, and each has its own specific function. Enzymes 
digest our food and convert it so that our muscles, nerves and 
glands are fortified. Enzymes assist kidneys, lungs, liver, 
skin and colon in their important eliminative tasks. Your body 
is a live enzyme organism and you need live enzyme food that 
is properly digested and properly assimilated. Enzymes are also 
necessary for proper elimination. 

We get enzymes from two sources; those made by our body and 
those we ingest. Only raw or uncooked food contains enzymes. 
Enzymes are heat sensitive, so when our food is cooked, most 
of the enzymes are destroyed. The body itself is called upon 
during digestion to take enzymes from the body to digest the
enzyme depleted food. This puts stress on our organs and 
tissues which in turn can have serious consequences. 

Digestion of food takes a high priority and acts as a powerful 
stimulus in the demand for enzymes. We add to that stress, 
pollution, strenuous exercise, colds, fever, pregnancy, 
caffeine, and alcohol which all contribute to enzyme depletion. 
The body may not have its storehouse of enzymes replenished at 
the necessary rate. When you eat food continually deficient in 
enzymes, your digestive organs become exhausted. The body puts 
a higher priority on digestion than on maintaining health, and 
it will call on enzymes from other parts of the body to finish 
the job, thereby depleting the immune system. Our body can be 
weakened to such an extent that it can no longer defend itself 
against disease. 

Dr. Edward Howell, in his book Nutritional Enzymes, likened 
the enzymes in our body to a bank account. Each of us is 
born with a limited number of enzymes our body can produce 
in a lifetime; we can call this our enzyme bank account. The 
enzyme bank account can get out of balance - heavy withdrawals 
and skimpy deposits. Deposits are made by eating enzyme rich
raw foods and by supplementing the diet with plant enzymes. 
Withdrawals are made by eating cooked or processed foods, and
by the number of enzyme robbers we mentioned earlier. As our 
enzyme bank account is depleted over the years, we begin to 
recognize illness, ulcers, constipation, bloating, arthritis,
headaches, PMS, chronic fatigue, etc, etc.

This is one of the major problems with everyone, not just 
our ADD children, we see in our center. If nothing else 
was done, supplementing your diet, and that of your child, 
with a good digestive enzyme, would result in a remarkable
improvement in your well-being.

5 - Elimiate the sugar. Easy to say, hard to do! Another 
of the major problems we see is sugar addiction. The
problem is not directly the sugar, but the yeast and 
fungi that are ravaging the ADD child's body and thriving 
on it. In fact, it is THE reason of the craving for the 
sugar. We have not found one child who has not had a 
significant yeast infestation! 

You must begin to remove sugar from the diet. There is the 
obvious - sweets. Then there is the not so obvious: read
the label! Just because a sugar is natural doesn't make it 
any better. Honey, fruits and fruit juices, breads and 
pastas, etc. It is not easy but it is where you MUST begin. 
You can't take it all away overnight; it might take a year 
to completely transition the child's diet. Very few things 
can have as direct an impact on the behavior of your ADD 
child as this can.

6 - Increase the veggies. And you thought taking the sugar 
away was going to be difficult! Your child's (and your)
diet should be 80% vegetable. Again, as with the sugar, 
this will normally not be a quick transition but one you 
phase in over a year's period. However, as in the sugar 
elimination, it is one of the most dynamic and important 
things you can do for your child. There are enormous 
resources available to you for making such a transition: 
books, tapes, seminars, recipes, suggestions, etc.
Once you start looking for them, you will be amazed.

This list is obviously just a few of the things you can 
do to begin helping your child. Numerous helpful books 
available can assist you on your journey. Check in your 
area for natural alternatives, such as chiropractors, 
naturopaths, wellness centers, nutritional microscopists, 
etc. They can be your allies and provide invaluable support. 
Check with the Feingold Association for local support groups, 
call the local health food stores and ask for referral to ADD
and/or autistic support groups, find other parents at your 
child's school and form your own support group.

It's not easy having ADD in your home. Nevertheless, it is 
possible to go on the offensive and begin changing the
situation. And, yes, it is possible to have a child who has 
been diagnosed as ADD to live a life that is "normal" (however 
that might be defined!) WITHOUT the drugs!

(NOTE: I would love to hear from you regarding your successes 
and/or failures.)

			MINCE MEAT DESSERT - ADD/ADHD

			   By Howie Thomason RNCP

It is important to realise that artificial food additives 
and food colourings are the most common substances that 
cause hyperactivity in children. Several studies suggest 
that food allergies and sensitivities can cause psychological 
symptoms as well.  It is important to eliminate the artificial 
additives, refined sugars, and all food allergens.

For Six Servings;

Combine into a sauce pan;

2        cups of tart chopped apples
1        cup raisins or currants
1/4      cup chopped pecans
1/4      cup chopped walnuts
1/2      cup apple juice
1/4      cup orange juice
2        tablespoons of maple syrup
1/3      cup of honey
2        teaspoons grated lemon peel
2        teaspoons grated orange peel
2        teaspoons apple pie spice

Bring to a boil and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes.
Let this cool slightly.  Serve in a small open bowl like a 
rice bowl for a light dessert.
