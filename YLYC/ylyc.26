====================                               issue 26 

                        Letter from the Editor 

	Welcome back to another issue of Your Life-Your Choice. 
We've got more terrific information for you, but I'd like to 
make you aware of some updates to the Your Life-Your Choice 
Headquarters. We've redesigned the Library of archives. I think 
you'll find that it is much easier to find an article that 
interests you. Check it out for yourself:
http://www.Life-Choices.com/archive.html.

	We've also added the beginnings of a Health Resource 
Center; http://www.Life-Choices.com/hlthresource.html. This 
will be a great place to find links to other sites with 
valuable health information. We are also on the lookout for 
health related tests and quizzes. These should be fun to do, 
while making you aware of any early indications of health 
concerns. We've found more quizzes, but are still waiting for 
reprint permission. Hopefully, you'll see them up soon. 
Keep checking!

    Until next time Your Life-Your Choice wishes you 
health and prosperity.

Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

	For many years I have suffered from arthritis. 
With additional homeopathic medicine, my condition 
stayed reasonably under control. 

	Recently my neck, shoulders and back were 
presenting a big problem. I was in constant pain. 
I was advised to find a good practitioner for 
acupuncture and acupressure, which I did. Not only 
is my condition back under control, but my blood 
pressure went down from 190/90 to normal which is 
140/80 in the process. All of this with only a 
couple of weeks of treatment. I would recommend 
this to anyone!

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

I am 57 years old, a diabetic and have had 2 strokes.
Since then I've had to be very careful of my blood 
pressure and sugar levels. For 6 weeks my levels have
been off the charts and my doctor had me come in every 
week. He expected me to have another stroks. My son-
in-law put me on a grape seed extract and a good fibre 
supplement. 5 days later I visited my doctor and he was 
amazed that everything was normal. So was I. I will 
stay on these herbs forever!

Section 4			Alzheimer's
				By Dr. Dale Heil


     Alzheimer's disease is a common form of dementia. A 
dementia is where an individual experiences a decline in 
intellectual and memory functioning. While often thought 
of as a disease of old age it can effect people in their 
forties.

     Currently, over 4 million suffer from Alzheimer's 
disease in the U.S. It affects over 10 percent of the 
Americans over age 65 and over 50% of those over age 85. 
Dementia is the 4th leading cause of death in those over
age 60. Death usually occurs within 5-10 years of diagnosis.
Once considered to be a psychological condition, it is now 
known to be a degenerative disorder with specific changes 
found within the brain. New memories cannot be formed and 
old memories cannot be remembered.

     Not all dementia's are Alzheimer's disease. Hardening 
of the arteries (arteriosclerosis), brain tumor, hypothyroidism, 
advanced syphilis, and stroke can also cause dementia. High 
concentrations of aluminum have been found in the brains of
Alzheimer's patients. These aluminum concentrations have been 
found to be especially high in the region of the hippocampus, 
an area of the brain strongly involved in memory. Aluminum is 
commonly found in cookware, antacids, anti-diarrhea medicines, 
buffered aspirin, deodorants, douches, food additives, and 
shampoos. These high concentrations of aluminum are a
controversial issue as it is not known whether it is the cause 
or the result of neuron dysfunction.
     
	While the cause of Alzheimer's disease is not known, the
possibilities include aluminum and/or mercury toxicity and 
nutritional deficiencies. Many nutritional deficiencies may 
result from the depletion of essential nutrients caused by
modern food processing methods. Malabsorption syndromes, 
medications, and alcohol abuse may also exacerbate these 
nutritional deficiencies. Because of the incomplete knowledge 
as to the cause, or even the ability to diagnosis Alzheimer's 
disease, it is beneficial to support the involved systems with 
6 Minchex 
6 Pituitrophin 
3 Hepatrophin and 
1 Ferrofood per day.....always.  

     The goal is not to cure Alzheimer's because there is 
no cure. Rather, the attempt is to stop or at least slow 
down the progression of the degeneration. It is also prudent 
to monitor nutritional progress. The Nutritional Health 
Survey (NHS) supplies a system by which other nutritional 
deficiencies can be identified and corrected. This is 
important with a disease entity such as Alzheimer's where 
the exact cause is not known. If multiple causal factors 
are involved, as is suspected, then all nutritional 
deficiency situations must be satisfied as much as possible.

     A report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the
mental deterioration of Alzheimer's disease can be slowed significantly 
by high doses of Vitamin E....an antioxidant. While Vitamin E did not 
reverse the disease among patients with moderate Alzheimer's, it did 
slow down the disability rate by an average of seven months.

     The search is on for methods to diagnose Alzheimer's more rapidly
and at an earlier stage. Earlier detection may allow people to make
decisions about future care and other matters. More information on 
Alzheimer's disease can be found at the Alzheimer's Association, 
Suite 1000, Chicago, IL. 60611. Telephone numbers:

Section 6   	   MASSAGE OILS - USES & BENEFITS

	  It seems that everything good for you these days has 
its roots in antiquity. Centuries ago, all these same types 
of medicine and healing techniques were practised in everyday 
use.

        The Roman Empire, which spanned 5000 years, was one of 
those cultures where massage, essential oils, luxurious baths 
and herbal formulas were used extensively to enhance health and 
beauty.

        Massage indicates the rubbing, kneading, pushing or 
sweeping of skin, muscles & joints of the body. Anyone can perform 
massage. A newborn usually receives his first massage upon his 
arrival here as mom & dads caress the face & head of their bundle 
of joy.

        When a toddler is ill or cranky, a mother will caress & 
soothe the child by gentle touch. When mothers rub our chest with 
linament when we had a cold, her hands somehow had some magic 
attached as you always felt better from that little rub. Essential 
oils were already added to those chest linaments. Now we have the 
access to make our own mixtures.

        Massage & essential oils may be the remedy you need to help 
you recuperate from a stressful work week, injury or illness. 
Studies have shown that regular massage once a month increases the 
efficiency of the immune system, increases mobility and decreases 
stress and muscle tension. Massage oils can be made at home, 
purchased at stores or obtained from your Aromatherapist or Massage 
Therapist.

You can make some at-home remedies yourself:

For the common cold, massage this blend around the chest, neck, 
& sinus areas:

Lemon		1 drop       
Eucalyptus    2 drops    
Rosemary	3 drops
Blend this into 1 tsp of vegetable or almond oil


Influenza
If you are shivery & cold, and feel that you have the onset of 
something more, take a warm bath to which the following oils 
have been added:

Tea tree	2 drops    
Lavender	2 drops     
Thyme		2 drops
Then:  massage your whole body with the following:
Tea tree	2 drops    
Eucalyptus	3 drops
Blend this into 1 tsp of vegetable/almond oil and go to bed.  

These essential oils have been shown to increase the immune 
system and can be used in the prevention of flu & colds when 
exposed to them.

Back Pain Formula
Massage this into any backache to ease pain:
Peppermint	10 drops   
Rosemary	10 drops   
Basil		10 drops
Add this to 30ml of vegetable/almond oil.

Relaxing Massage Oil:
Lavender	10 drops    
Lemon		5 drops   
Bergamot	5 drops
Lime		3 drops   
Grapefruit	3 drops
Blend this to 30 ml of vegetable/almond oil.

Sore Muscle Formula
Rosemary	5 drops     
Juniper	10 drops    
Lavender	10 drops
Marjoram	10 drops     
Lemon		5 drops
Mix to 30ml of vegetable/almond oil

Circulation Increased
Rosemary	15 drops    
Angelica	5 drops    
Juniper	5 drops
Add this to 30 ml of vegetable/almond oil


Any of the above mixtures or formulas can be added to the bath as bath
oil.

Section 7			Yarrow
			(Achillea millefolium)

			By Howie M. Thomason RNCP
				hmt@ican.net
			      1-888-770-0033

----------

This month we will look at Yarrow.  It combines well with 
Boneset, the herb we looked at last month, for influenza 
and the common cold.


Common names;

Yarrow, Milfoil, Nosebleed, Thousand Leaf, Soldiers Woundwort.


Collection;

Yarrow should be gathered when it is flowering, usually 
between June and September. It is a perineal herb found 
throughout North America and Europe. It is often found 
on the roadside and waste lands.  The beautiful aroma
from this plant is one method of identification. Here in 
Ontario, I find it in sandy soil in fields.


Parts Used;

Some herbalists will say only the aerial parts can be used. 
Others will say the whole plant including the roots can be 
used.


Properties;

Diaphoretic		(sweating herb)
Hypotensive      	(reduce elevated blood pressure, 
			 tending to normalize systolic
                      & diastolic levels.)
Astringent;          (contract tissue by precipitating proteins)
Diuretic;            (increase secretion and elimination of urine)
Antiseptic;          (Destroys and prevents the development of 
			 microbes)
Carminative;    	(Stimulates peristalsis, relax stomach)


Constituents;

Up to 0.5% volatile oils, flavonoids, tannins, bitter alkoids.


Energy and Flavours;

Warm, Bitter, Spicy.


Indications;

Yarrow is one of our best diaphoretic herbs.  It is easily found 
and is a standard remedy for helping the body to deal with fevers. 
The hot infusion will raise the heat of the body, equalize the 
circulation and produce perspiration. It is very effective in 
fevers in children and adults. It has also been useful in measles 
and all of the eruptive conditions, especially where the eruption
is slow making its appearance. It can stimulate digestion and tone 
the blood vessels. It is considered a specific herb for conditions 
associated with high blood pressure. It can be used as a urinary 
antiseptic for infections such as cystitis.

Used externally it will aid in the healing of wounds.

It may be considered for amenorrhea, menorrhagia, and leucorrhea,  
all being caused, at least in part, by poor pelvic circulation and 
weakness.

This herb has long been associated with the battlefield and is a
specific antihemorrhagic wound remedy.  It can be used internally 
or externally for any condition of acute bleeding, especially from 
cuts and abrasions. It got its name from the warrior Achilles.


Combinations;

For fever it will combine well with Elder Flower, Peppermint, 
Boneset, Cyanne and Ginger.

For Raised Blood Pressure it can be used with Hawthorn, Lime 
Blossom and Mistletoe.


Preparation and Dosage;

Infusion: pour a cup of boiling water onto l-2 teaspoonfuls of 
the dried herb and leave to infuse for l0-l5 minutes. This should 
be drunk hot three times a day. When feverish it should be drunk 
hourly until sweating is produced.

Tincture: take 2-4ml of the tincture three times a day.
For those that do not want or like the alcohol in the tincture 
they can drop the tincture into a cup of hot water to evaporate 
the alcohol.
