Welcome to the first issue of  Your Life - Your Choice. A FREE monthly
subscription based newsletter geared to informing YOU about all forms 
of alternative and complimentary health and medical choices.

Although traditional medicine provides us with a valuable resource, there

Section 2.			TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

Dear Brigitte;

I wanted to share an experience I had that made my life a lot
healthier and less painful by supplementing my diet. I was 
diagnosed with dysplasia of the breast about 6 years ago. It 
started out with just a single tender spot on the right breast and 
slowly spread to infect both breasts. The result was similar but 
more severe to being in the ninth month of pregnancy for 5 years. 
Because of my family history, I am considered a high risk for 
breast cancer, therefore I went for regular checkups and mammograms.  
My doctor routinely inquired about the pain of the dysplasia and 
asked if I was in need of pain killers. He stated the longer I could 
go without the better, as I would be dependant on them for the rest 
of my life. (Dysplasia is the mutation of new cell growth) I was 
introduced to herbal products by a family member about a year and a 
half ago and am now totally pain free with no need of painkillers 
and no side affects, other than I feel healthier, have more energy, 
and have lost an unneeded ten pounds. I believe that every woman 
should be taking a supplement with a concentration of 
indole-3-carbinols, which is the active ingredient in Broccoli, 
Brussel Sprouts, Cabbage, etc. The ingredient that all Cancer 
Societies recommend that women should have.  My children get 
it everyday as well because I don't believe any of us get enough 
NUTRITOUS vegetables in our diet.

Dear Brigitte,

My grandson is 9 years old and has always been a pleasant child, 
helpful and eager to please (for short periods of time). However, 
at school especially, he was having difficulty concentrating and 
paying attention. He would leave his seat without permission, and 
be resentful of taking direction from teachers or anyone.

Being his Grandma, I have lots of time to look into how to help 
this sometimes moody, sometimes happy little boy.  I talked to 
parents, neighbours and everyone. Finally I heard about an herbal 
supplement that was having good results. His parents agreed that 
it was worth a try. 

About 3 weeks after taking his herbs we all noticed that he was 
more agreeable and not so jumpy.  Even his teacher mentioned he 
was quicker and was taking more interest in finishing his work 
without complaints.

It is now about 8 months since we started this herbal supplement 
and his whole attitude has improved tremendously. He wants to please 
rather than disrupt and is much more calm and relaxed. He gets along 
better at school and with his peers. He is a much happier child. His 
teacher has commented on his improved attitude and wishes she had more 
students like him.  Herbal supplements are wonderful! I use them; our 
children do and now my grandson does.

Section 3.
DISPELLING VACCINATION MYTHS:
An introduction to the contradictions between medical science and 
immunization policy.

 by Alan Phillips  

INTRODUCTION 

Is there a legitimate controversy?

        When my son began his routine vaccination series at age 2 
months, I did not know there were any risks associated with 
immunizations. But the clinic's literature contained a contradiction: 
the chances of a serious adverse reaction to the DPT vaccine were 1 
in 1750, while his chances of dying from pertussis each year were 1 
in several million. When I pointed this out to the physician, he 
angrily disagreed, and stormed out of the room mumbling, "I guess I 
should read that sometime..." Soon thereafter I learned of a child 
who had been permanently disabled by a vaccine, so I decided to 
investigate for myself. My findings have so alarmed me that I feel 
compelled to share them; hence, this report.

        Health authorities credit vaccines for disease declines, 
and assure us of their safety and effectiveness. Yet these seemingly 
rock-solid assumptions are directly contradicted by health statistics, 
medical studies, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) reports, and reputable research scientists from 
around the world.  In fact, infectious diseases declined steadily for 
decades prior to vaccinations, U.S. doctors report thousands of serious 
vaccine reactions each year including hundreds of deaths and permanent
disabilities, fully vaccinated populations have experienced epidemics, 
and researchers attribute dozens of chronic immunological and 
neurological conditions to mass immunization programs.

        There are hundreds of published medical studies documenting 
vaccine failure and adverse effects, and dozens of books written by 
doctors, researchers, and independent investigators that reveal serious 
flaws in immunization theory and practice. Ironically, most 
pediatricians and parents are completely unaware of these findings. 
However, this has begun to change in recent years, as a growing number 
of parents and healthcare providers around the world are becoming 
aware of the problems and starting to question the use of widespread, 
mandatory vaccinations.

        My point is not to tell anyone whether or not to vaccinate, 
but rather, with the utmost urgency, to point out some very good 
reasons why everyone should examine the facts before deciding whether 
or not to submit to the procedure. As a new parent, I was shocked to 
discover the absence of a legal mandate or professional ethic requiring
pediatricians to be fully informed, and to see first-hand the prevalence 
of physicians who are applying practices based on incomplete--and in some
cases, outright mis--information.

        Though only a brief introduction, this report contains 
sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation by all 
concerned, which I highly recommend. You will find that this is 
the only way to get an objective view, as the controversy is a highly 
emotional one.

        A note of caution: Be careful trying to discuss this subject 
with a pediatrician. Most have staked their identities and reputations 
on the presumed safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and thus have 
difficulty acknowledging evidence to the contrary. The first 
pediatrician I attempted to share my findings with yelled angrily at 
me when I calmly brought up the subject. The misconceptions have very 
deep roots.  ...

... This report by Alan Phillips contains very powerful research, and 
as the editor of Your Life-Your Choice I felt it was important to 
share this with you. I extend my apologies in that the findings of Alan 
are too lengthy to include within this newsletter. I strongly encourage 
you to go to the Your Life-Your Choice website;
http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~b.synesael/yourlife/issue1.html where this 
article is featured in its entirety. As parents, we owe it to our 
children to investigate this further. As adults, we owe it to ourselves 
to discover how facts can be manipulated. Alan will uncover the 10 myths 
and truths of vaccinations. He'll also share with you the resources that
support his findings and where YOU can acquire additional information on 
this highly controversial issue.

Section 4.		ACUPUNCTURE - A NEW OLD TRADITION
				Christopher C. Browne

Christopher Browne is a certified Doctor of Acupuncture. His studies 
were conducted at Colombo South General Hospital, Sri Lanka (known as 
the largest and best teaching facility in the world of Acupuncture). 
He has acquired a D.AC., Ph.D in Acupuncture and is one of 4 C.A.P.'s
(Certified Addiction Professional) in Canada. Among other associations, 
he is a founder member of the Comonwealth Institute of Acupuncture & 
Natural Medicines. Christopher Browne accepts appointments at 
117 Grand Ave, London, Ontario, N6C 1L9 and can be reached at 
(519)439-0854.

	In North America, one of the most highly industrialized societies 
in the world, people are enjoying a very affluent lifestyle, free of the 
life depravities common in many developing countries. However, millions 
of people suffer from various kinds of non-infectious, chronic, 
constitutional and aging induced degenerative ailments. Our intense
industrialization and urbanization have produced a very complicated 
competitive and fast moving society which produces constant emotional 
and mental strain or "stress". How to cope with stress related ailments
effectively is fast becoming our main concern.

	Today, more and more people are seeking alternative therapies. 
This trend has been very conscious over the past two decades. In 1972, 
the news of Acupuncture Anesthesia from China surged all over the world. 
This focused attention on oriental medicine has been practiced as a 
genuine medicine in China and other far eastern countries for the past 
three thousand years. Today, more and more western medical professionals 
have started studying and practicing Acupuncture. The demand has been
increasing yearly.

The World Health Organization has adopted Acupuncture, moxibustion and 
Chinese Herbology as an alternative medicine. It has been actively 
promoting its understanding and development all over the world.

Oriental medicine is growing in popularity steadily in spite of its 
rather unintelligible science, for these reasons:

1. It is an empirical medicine which has been developed, and systemized,
and has survived for 3,000 years among Asian people.

2. It is effective for non-infectious, chronic, constitutional and 
degenerative disorders and stress-related ailments, which have not been
adequately coped with by conventional medicine.

3. It is based on a philosophy that the human being is part of nature; 
our body is controlled by the universal law (Natural Law); therefore we 
have to live in harmony with nature as much as possible. This philosophy
matches the demands of modern people who have been deprived of living in
harmony with nature because of the rapid urbanization and it's artificial
environment.

4. It emphasizes the holistic approach towards ailments and the diseased
person; the patient is treated just as a whole being with union of body, 
mind and spirit, instead of being treated as a diseased body. The 
therapist's relationship towards the patient is emphatic, personal and 
close.

5. It is very natural, safe and has virtually no side effects. The most
commonly accepted theory is the "Nerve-reflex Theory". It holds that 
when abnormal conditions occur in an internal organ, alterations take 
place in the skin and muscle related to that organ via the nervous system. 
The nervous system extending through the internal organs, the skin and 
the subcutaneous tissue and muscles, constantly transmit information about 
the physical condition to the spinal cord and the brain. These information 
impulses set up a reflex action that cause symptoms of internal organic
disorders to manifest themselves on the surface areas of the body as
hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity, spasm, contraction, tightness or 
lumping of the muscles, discolouration, dryness or oiliness of the skin, 
etc. At the same time, the ultimate relation of the internal organs and
external ones has the reverse effect too. I.e. stimulation on the skin 
and the muscles from the outside are transmitted to the inside via the 
nervous system.

	It is in these areas that Acupuncture and moxibustion has 
utilized this relationship to its advantage. In fact it has been 
scientifically verified that Acupuncture and moxibustion can cause 
dilation of the vessels and increase the overall blood and lymph 
circulation, increase the production of blood cells, activate the 
hormone secretion and immune system, relax the contracted or spastic 
muscles etc. It is now believed that Acupuncture releases endorphins. 
Bruce Pomeranzs M.D. (McGill), Ph.D. (Harvard), Professor of 
Neurobiology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada pioneer scientific 
worker on the Endorphin Mechanism found that it is by this mechanism 
that Acupuncture has it's analgesic effect.

	Medical professionals as well as the public in our western 
countries are conditioned to believe that Oriental medicine, especially
Acupuncture can be effective only for "pain relief". However, in the 
Asian and some European countries these treatments have been applied to 
almost every kind of ailment and the public are more aware of its merits 
and demerits.

	Popular belief is that Oriental medicine is more effective for 
non-infectious, chronic, constitutional and aging induced diseases, 
while Western medicine is very effective for acute, infectious and 
mechanical disorders. The World Health Organization has put forward a 
similar list of disorders, which lend themselves to Oriental medicines. 
>From my clinical experiences, the most commonly treatable ailments by
Acupuncture and moxibustion are:

1.	DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Acute chronic gastritis stomach or duodenum ulcers, diarrhea, 
constipation, hemorrhoids, chronic liver and gall bladder problems, 
heartburn, nausea, stomach cramps, etc.

2.	DERMATOLOGICAL SYSTEM
Eczema, acne, strophulus, itchy skin, hives, warts, freckles, herpes 
zoster, hair loss problems, etc.

3.	EYES, EARS AND NOSE
Eye strain, stye, conjunctivitis, cataracts, iritis, blood-shot eyes, 
ear-ache, ringing in the ears, hearing difficulties, menieres syndrome, 
sinus problems, rhinitis, stuffed nose, snoring, etc.

4.	EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHIATRIC
Depression, insomnia, neurosis, stress and tension, irritability, 
senile dementia, etc.

5.	ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
Diabetes, thyroid problems, gout, etc.

6.	GENITO URINARY SYSTEM
Urethritis, cystitis, painful or irregular menstruation, pregnancy 
induced problems, proctitis, urination problems, frequent or infrequent
nephrosis, kidney malfunction, impotency, menopausal syndrome, etc.

7.	MOUTH
Stomatitis, sore tongue, toothache, tonsillitis, etc.

8.	MOTHER AND INFANT
Insufficient lactation, mastitis, habitual miscarriage, morning 
sickness, malposition of the fetus, bedwetting, night crying, 
hyperactivity, auto intoxication, habitual vomiting, etc.

9.	MUSCULO-SKELETAL SYSTEM
Stiff or painful neck or shoulders, backache (acute or chronic), 
sciatica, arthritis, tendonitis, rheumatism.

10.	HEAD	
Headaches, migraine, neuralgia (facial, intercostal, etc.) facial 
paralysis, numbness in the hands and feet, post stroke syndrome, etc.

11.	RESPIRATORY AND CIRCULATORY
Common cold, bronchitis, asthma, hay fever, heart palpitation, 
arrythmia, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, poor blood 
circulation, etc.

12.	OTHERS
Smoking addiction, weight loss and general health maintenance...the 
newest technological breakthrough in Laser therapy & Electro 
Acupuncture.

	This is only a partial list of the ailments treated by 
Acupuncture and moxibustion; Oriental medicine could be applied to 
more ailments in combination with Western medicine for the welfare 
of all. More and more Medical Universities are combining both schools 
of medicine. Gynecologists are using Acupuncture to relieve labour 
pains and correct malposition of the fetus in the mother's womb. 
Dentists are using it as anesthesia for the extraction of teeth and 
operations on the gums.


				A FUTURE MEDICINE
	
	During the last few decades, scientific discoveries have caused 
an incredible expansion in the frontiers of knowledge. Revolutionary
breakthrough's, each with the potential equal to the discovery of 
gunpowder are now accelerating the pace of human affairs. Einstein's 
theory of relativity, high energy physics, decoding of the genetic 
space travel, the evolution of cybernetics and computers as a tool of 
human intelligence have been remarkable advancements. Despite the 
destructive applications of several discoveries, each possesses a 
common denominator. They all represent the expansion of human 
understanding into an area where logical reasoning seems no longer 
relevant or valid.

	Acupuncture and moxibustion, although effective is now on the 
threshold of being understood. As it's mechanisms are revealed through
carefully controlled scientific research, it is offering another 
breakthrough in health care.

Section 5.			CHOICE TIDBITS

The Facts on Flaxseed

	Flaxseed has emerged as food with potential disease-fighting 
power and the national Cancer Institute is currently studying its 
possible health benefits, reports Environmental Nutrition (August 1995).
	"The renewed interest in flax has been fueled by its possible link 
to preventing cancer. Flaxseeds are an important source of lignins, plant
compounds that provide fiber and exhibit anti-cancer properties. In 
humans, cancers of the breast, colon and prostate are cited as most 
likely to be thwarted by lignins, but more studies are needed."
	The report continues, "Flaxseed is a rich source of alphalinolenic 
acid, and essential fatty acid the body can convert into omega 3 fatty 
acids. Research has indicated that omega 3 has been shown to keep blood
platelets from sticking together and building up on artery walls."
			(Let's Live, April 1996)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Antioxidant Interactions

	"Epidemiologist Paul Jacques and his colleagues at the Human 
Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, gathered diet
information and blood samples from 680 elderly people to find out how
antioxidants interact. The researchers separated people by how much 
vitamin C and carotenoids - a family of antioxidants in fruits and 
vegetables - they were getting from food. They also asked whether the
volunteers were taking vitamin E supplements. Then the scientists 
checked blood smples to see whether participants who were getting a 
lot of one vitamin had higher levels of the others.
	Vitamin C came out on top, providing the strongest protection 
to the other vitamins:  The group who got the most vitamin C from 
their diet (more than 220 milligrams a day, or roughly the amount in 
four oranges) had, on an average, 18 percent more vitamin E in their 
blood than people with the lowest intake of C (below 120 mg a day). 
Similarly, carotenoid levels jumped 13 percent for the high-C group.
	Meanwhile, those who got the most carotenoids (more than 5.5 mg 
a day, or what you'd get from three to five servings of a colorful mix 
of vegetables) had six percent more vitamin E in their blood. The people 
who got more than 30 mg a day of vitamin E had seven percent more 
vitamin C… Because people with highest intake of vitamin C received the 
most benefits, it's worth ensuring that you get at least 220 mg a day.
