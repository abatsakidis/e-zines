Letter From the Editor

With greater demands being placed on people in the work
place to work longer hours and produce faster results,
there is also an increasing number of reports of wrist
problems relating to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Although long,
daily hours sitting at a computer is a common culprit, ANY
repetitive hand movements, like typing or hammering, will
result in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome over time. This would
include certain Production Line Workers, Roofers, musicians
and typists to name only a few.

In order to deal with this incredibly painful health issue,
it is essential to first be sure that you have a correct
diagnosis by a qualified and knowledgeable physician,
preferably an orthopedic surgeon or a neurologist. There
are many conditions that have similar symptoms to those of
carpal tunnel syndrome but require different treatments;
for example: A pinched nerve in your neck or shoulder can
cause a similar numbness and tingling in the hand. So can
diabetic neuropathy. Arthritis at the base of the thumb or
in the hand can also cause similar symptoms.

In the wrist there is a circular-like band made up of bones
and ligaments which is called the transverse carpal
ligament. The center hole of this ligament is called the
Carpal Tunnel. Through this tunnel runs tendons (that allow
us to move our fingers and grasp objects), and the median
nerve (which provides us with sensation in our fingers and
thumb). The most common cause of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is
an inflammation of the tendons. This causes the tendons to
swell which will eventually put so much pressure on the
median nerve that it will no longer function properly.

Aside from overuse, there are other instigators of swelling
in this area. Fluid retention is one example, and fractures
around the wrist and hand is another. Not only can a
fracture itself cause swelling, but even a slight change in
the shape of the bones as they heal can  narrow the passage
for the median nerve.

Although surgery is a common treatment in severe cases of
this syndrome, there are a number of holistic, non-invasive
treatments available as well. I encourage you to
investigate all of your options and consult with your local
health care provider to determine the best course of action
for YOU.

Biofeedback is a specialized type of training which allows
you to gain control over physiological reactions that are
ordinarily unconscious and automatic. In other words, you
consciously train your body to perform tasks differently
(more constructively) than when you did them without
thinking about it. The training methods are relatively
simple, although they require complex and precise
instrumentation. Once the specific mode of treatment has
been determined, you are connected to a device similar to a
computer to monitor the response of your movements. This
non-invasive process involves sensitive biofeedback
instruments that measure and feedback what is happening
inside your body. This feedback about your physiology is
immediate, ongoing, and exact.Over time you will be able to
control your specific body function without the use of the
computer. Often people use too much force in striking
computer keys, grasping pens, pressing on guitar strings,
etc.  Using biofeedback for specific muscle groups can give
valuable information about the level of muscle activity in
performing these specific tasks.

Acupuncture has shown significant success in treating
health issues such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In fact many
other modalities also use the acupuncture points to
accomplish their goals in treatment. The November 1997
National Institute of Health (NIH) Panel Consensus Report
Supports Acupuncture for a number of health issues, among
them Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

Reconstructive Therapy has been practiced in the United
States for over 60 years and can provide a more
cost-effective solution than surgery.  Carpal tunnel
syndrome is one of many afflictions that responds well to
reconstructive therapy.

Anti-inflammatory herbs can be effective in reducing the
inflammation of the tendons. This treatment can be used
independently (depending on the severity of the condition)
or in conjunction with other treatments.

A new type of massage called Specific Lymphatic Massage®
can be performed by Massage Therapists, Kinesiologists,
Physical Therapists, Nurses, Occupational Therapists, any
health care provider who utilizes therapeutic body work as
part of a Holistic Health care regimen. Specific Lymphatic
Massage® requires specialized training and carries with it
independent certification.

There are numerous other avenues to investigate as well.
Magnetic Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Naturopathy, Orthomolecular
Medicine, Acupressure, and Homeopathy all well recognized
modalities and have options to offer you in your search of
pain relief from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. You may find a
combination of treatments will work best for you.

                  Cancer Preventing Super Foods
                         By Dr. John Maher

Although currently heart disease kills most of us, it seems
in general we dread cancer more. It is even sometimes
called , "The Big C", and code worded by doctors as "CA",
apparently because we don't even like to say or hear the
word! Interestingly, after of billions of dollars in
research it appears that the quotes below, credited to two
famous men, were truly prophetic.

"Let your food be your medicine"- Hippocrates

"The doctor of the future….will interest his patients in
diet, care of the human frame, and in the prevention of
disease."   Thomas Edison

In 1992, a scientist  named Caragay developed a hierarchy
of potential cancer preventative foods. The National Cancer
institute is currently investigating these foods,
specifically those at the top of the pyramid*, to further
clarify the biological effect of these foods on health and
cancer prevention.

Garlic  Cabbages  Licorice and Ginger  Soy, Carrots,
Celery, Parsnips  Onions, Green Tea, Tumeric, Citrus  Whole
Wheat, Flax Seed, and Brown Rice  Tomato, Egg Plant and
Peppers (the  Solanacea).  Broccoli, Cauliflower, and
Brussel Spouts (the Cruciferae).  Oats, Mints, Oregano,
Cucumber, Rosemary, Sage, and Potato.  Thyme, Chives,
Cantaloupe, Basil, Tarragon, Barley and the Berries

*Foods are ranked in order of importance from top to bottom

These plants are rich in phytochemicals. Such plant
chemicals are "signaling molecules" plants use to
communicate within themselves. As an example, in grape
seeds phytochemical antioxidant compounds called
polyphenols protect its DNA in dry or light intensive
environments. In berries, the carotenoids provide color to
signal pollinators such as birds or insects.

There may be over 10,000 different phytochemicals that have
biological activity in humans. There are over a dozen
general classes, such as carotenoids, coumarins,
flavonoids, indoles, lignans and phenolic acids.

So although taking an iron free mega-multivitamin/mineral
and extra antioxidants is part of good anti-aging and
longevity strategy, there is NO substitute for including a
generous amount of a variety of the above "Super Foods" in
our diets.

Coenzyme Q10: Anti-wrinkle protection

Coenzyme Q10 was discovered in 1957. This vitamin-like
substance, present in every cell of the body, is vitally
important for cell functioning: it plays major role in
energy production and is a powerful antioxidant.

Doctors and researchers around the globe have been
investigating CoQ10, and now it is used for a variety of
ailments and as a part of preventive care:  * Q10 is needed
for anything that requires energy: heart and liver
functioning, sperm production, muscles activity  * it
boosts immune system  * shown to be effective in treatment
of gum diseases  * lowers blood pressure  * it is used for
cancer treatment and was noticed to reduce tumors.

Human body has the ability to make its own CoQ10, but after
the age of 20 the production levels decline, and the demand
grows. Foods highest in coenzyme Q10 include beef, spinach,
sardines, albacore tuna, and peanuts, but unfortunately,
high temperature that we use to cook meals will affect the
coenzyme. That is why older people and those who want to
use Q10 for therapeutic effect will benefit from taking it
as a supplement.

How effective is Q10 in skin care? Wrinkles appear when
skin looses its elasticity, and this is due to decreased
collagen production and collagen crosslinking. Everyday
life, cell metabolism, exposure to sun and other
environmental factors, toxins, cigarette smoke - all result
in production of free radicals. Those overactive pesky
molecules or atoms have odd electrons on their orbits and
try to balance out themselves. They either give away the
odd electron or find a pair for it, thus making another
molecule unstable, turning it into another free radical.
While this process is natural and unavoidable as a part of
metabolism, too many free radicals cause a dangerous chain
reaction that destroys cellular compounds and can damage
DNA, proteins and lipids (fats). When it comes to skin
aging, free radicals interfere with collagen production and
cause premature aging.

Coenzyme Q10 has exceptional antioxidant properties.
Studies show that it can effectively counteract free
radical damage and provide significant protection against
UVA-induced depletion of cell membrane. In other words, it
will prevent damage to collagen and elastin production
process and help you avoid wrinkles.

Q10 is so powerful an antioxidant, it is able to reduce
cancer tumors and minimize stroke consequences that are due
to suddenly increased levels of free radicals. So when
applied topically, it can provide extra protection for your
skin and produce dramatic anti-wrinkle effect.
