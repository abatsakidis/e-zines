The 4-Day Diversified Rotation Diet is presented in a 3-part
series. Last month in part one, you found out the physiologic 
basis for the diet. Today in part two you will find out 
specifically what the diet consists of, and how you can use 
it to prevent or reverse degenerative diseases or aging. Next 
month in part three you will find out how to manage food and 
other addictions that play such a major role in the development 
of degenerative diseases. 

Here is the 4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet. You can get started
on it without food testing. This is found to be adequate for 
most people.  If you start the  4 Day Diversified Rotation Diet 
by initially leaving out the foods you commonly use, it usually 
works quite well in reversing the disease process. The 4 Day 
Diversified Rotation Diet can later incorporate these foods back
into your diet after three months if they are eaten on a four 
day rotation basis. Ninety-five percent of the time, these foods
can be re-introduced without producing symptoms. The 4 Day 
Diversified Rotation Diet should become a lifestyle.

HOW TO USE A FOUR DAY DIVERSIFIED ROTATION DIET
                           WITHOUT DELIBERATE FOOD TESTING

Many people find it practical to go directly to a four day 
diversified rotation diet without food testing. First assume
that you are reacting to any food eaten as frequently as 
twice a week, or to any members of that food family. Leave 
these frequentty used foods out of your diet for three months.
At the initiation of the rotation diet,  stop all use of 
caffeine (coffee, teas with caffeine, cola drinks, chocolate),
tobacco and all alcoholic drinks. DO NOT RE-INTRODUCE THESE 
INTO THE DIET.

For the next three to four days, there will be withdrawal
symptoms. Handle these symptoms as described in the 
section - "How To Initiate This Program."

Three months from now, re-introduce these foods back into
your diet. Nearly always   (95% of the time), these foods
will no longer be reactive, as long as you keep them on a
once-in-four-day rotation basis. When re-introducing foods
into your diet, simply add the food to the established 
rotation and observe whether or not symptoms occur. If no
symptoms occur, then this food can be rotated. If symptoms 
occur, wait another three months before trying this food 
again.

One way to expand the use of foods is to sprout cereal 
grains and legumes. You should make certain that the 
grain or bean is sprouted with approximately 1/4" or 
more of a sprout. The foods that have been sprouted
will no longer carry the same reactive capacity that
the non-sprouted foods do. Thus, once sprouted, grains
and legumes can be introduced into the diet immediately. 

Gluten is the most frequent and severe symptom reactor of
all foods. Thus, gluten is the most likely food substance
to continue causing symptoms. Common physical reactions 
to gluten include: gastrointestinal problems such as celiac 
disease and Crohn's disease (gluten enteropathy), jerking 
muscles (Tourette's syndrome), and headache. Emotional and
mental symptoms caused by reactions to gluten range from 
mild (tension, anxiety, phobias, depression, obsessions, 
compulsion) to severe   (psychotic depression, hallucinations, 
delusions). The  genetically determined immunologic reaction 
to gluten occurrs at a ratio of 1 in 200 Irish people and 1 in 
2,000 non-Irish.  These immunologically reactive people should 
leave gluten out of their diet. Wheat, rye, oats and barley all
contain gluten. If gluten is introduced, only a small amount 
should be used, and then avoided for months.

In addition to being the most reactive food substance in terms
of immunologic and non- immunologic maladaptive reactions, 
gluten is the most addictive of all food substances. Gluten 
is split in half during the first stage of digestion, which 
occurs in the stomach by a combination of hydrochloric acid 
with the enzyme pepsin. This splitting of gluten produces an 
active narcotic (exorphin). This narcotic becomes addicting 
when it is absorbed through the small intestine without further
digestion by pancreatic enzymes and their normal alkaline medium.
Many people do not produce adequate pancreatic enzymes or 
associated sodium and potassium bicarbonate. Thus. these people
are subject to gluten addiction if they use gluten frequently.
Alcoholics using alcohol prepared from wheat, rye. oats or
barley will have symptoms emerge on deliberate food testing 
for these gluten- containing foods. Vodka addicts have symptoms 
to provocative food testing for white potatoes. Wine addicts 
have symptoms to a provocative test meal of either grapes or 
the substance from which the wine is made. This applies to wine
vinegar as well. Beer addicts have symptoms with test meals to
brewer's yeast or any gluten-containing cereal or rice used in
the beer-making process.

Dairy products and beef are the second most symptom reactive 
foods. Characteristically, the person who reacts to dairy
products also reacts to beef and vice versa. In terms of
the frequency of symptoms, corn products are approximately
equal to dairy products and beef.

People with homocystinuria have symptoms from dairy products 
and meats. Homocystinuria is an infrequent genetic error. It
is caused by a deficiency of cystathionine B-synthase enzyme,
in which methionine cannot be processed property. Occasionally,
homocystinuria is due to a nutritional deficiency of the B 
complex vitamins, especially B12 or folic acid. In these 
nutritional deficiency cases, B complex supplementation solves 
the problem of food reactions to high methionine containing foods.
People with genetic homocystinuria must rely on avoidance of
foods high in methionine. They must also supplement cystine, 
which comes from methionine.  In addition, they should also 
supplement taurine, which is made from cystine. Taurine is
important in keeping the central nervous system calm.

Another rare genetic enzyme disorder is carnosinuria. 
This is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme carnosinase. 
This enzyme processes carnosine and anserine. If not 
enzymatically processed, carnosine and anserine are 
toxic to humans. People with this genetic enzyme 
disorder must avoid foods containing carnosine and 
anserine. Carnosine is found in all land animals 
Anserine is found in tuna and salmon. Carnosinase 
is a zinc- dependent enzyme. Therefore, carnosinuria 
is occasionally caused by zinc deficiency. Zinc 
deficiency can be determined by a laboratory assessment. 
Physical symptoms of zinc deficiency include: white spots
in the fingernails and toenails, ridged or easily splitting 
fingernails, and stretch marks on the skin, especially on the
abdomen or breasts. When carnosinuria is caused by a 
nutritional deficiency, zinc supplementation can solve 
the problem. A carnosinase enzyme deficiency can produce
a wide range of symptoms. The most prominent symptoms
Dr. Philpott has observed are attention deficit and 
hyperactivity. For example, a ten-year-old boy with 
attention deficit and hyperactivity on laboratory 
testing was demonstrated to have both carnosinuria and 
zinc deficiency. Neither supplementation with zinc nor
rotation of foods solved his problem. However, upon 
removal of meats, tuna, and salmon from his diet, he 
was free of symptoms.

Dr. Philpott explains these genetic and nutritional 
disorders in order to point out that although the 
rotation diet solves most food reaction symptoms, 
these other causes of food reactions must sometimes
be considered. Laboratory tests can help make the 
determination.  People who try to help themselves 
without medical supervision can make this 
determination only through trial and error.

For twenty years Dr. Philpott deliberately food 
tested his patients. This consisted of five days
of avoidance of any food used with the frequency 
of two or more times a week, followed by food tests
of single food per test meal. Classically, it is
the foods eaten with a frequency of two or more 
times a week that produce acute symptoms and are 
also responsible for the symptoms of degenerative
diseases. This is true of degenerative diseases 
such as diabetes mellitus type II, arthritis of 
various types, inflammatory reactions such as 
tendinitis, myositis, fibrositis, and many pains 
such as headaches and pains elsewhere in the body. 
Secondarily, these maladaptive reactions are 
important in major mental disorders, multiple 
sclerosis, lupus. etc. These diseases classically
initially start with a viral infection which 
disorders the immune system and injures target 
tissues where symptoms are produced.

Stress factors such as injury, frequency of use, 
local infection, etc., often serve to prepare a 
specific area of the body to be the area selected 
as the target tissue area in food reaction. An
example is carpal tunnel syndrome, classically 
occurring in the wrist that is used most frequently.
Dr. Philpott has examined numerous carpel tunnel
syndrome cases and found them all to be due to food
maladaptive reactions. The stress of use associated
with the food reaction combine to produce the 
inflammatory reaction of the specific area. In 
major mental illness, there exists a primary 
chronic viral infection of the brain which prepares 
the brain to be the target organ for a maladaptive 
food reaction. Malnutrition can also be a factor
predisposing to maladaptive reactions to foods, 
chemicals, and inhaled substances, and to the 
selection of particular tissue areas for the 
maladaptive reaction.

Years of experience of deliberate food testing has 
provided convincing evidence that it is the stress 
of the frequency of contact that produces the 
maladaptive reactions to foods, chemicals, and 
inhaled substances. This is true, whether these 
are lgG immunological reactions or non-immunological 
reactions. The frequency needs to be more than two 
times per week. A practical food rotation diet can
be set up, avoiding any food eaten as frequently 
as two times a week or more. Initially, avoid these
foods for three months. Ninety-five percent of 
the time, after three months of avoidance, these 
initial foods left out of the diet can be 
introduced back into the four-day diversified
rotation diet without symptoms being produced.
Gluten from wheat, rye, oats, or barley is the 
most frequent and most serious cause of food
producing reactions. Dairy foods and corn products 
come in for a good second. Any food used frequently 
can become a reactive substance. The same principle 
of frequent contact producing maladaptive symptoms
applies also to chemicals and inhaled substances.


HOW TO INITIATE THIS PROGRAM

The four-day diversified rotation diet and avoidance 
of symptoms of frequently used foods is initiated at
the same time. Furthermore, to be discontinued at the 
same time is the use of any tobacco, alcohol, and 
caffeine beverages. The first three days will be
the most serious symptom-evoking period. By the 
fifth day, usually the symptoms have materially 
subsided and have become manageable. To handle 
the acute withdrawal symptoms, you will need to 
have available the following magnets:

Two 11/2 x 3/8 inch ceramic disc magnets. 
These have a gauss strength of 3,950.

Two 4 x 6 x 11/2 inch ceramic block magnets 
with a gauss strength of 3,950.

For some people. it would be well for them to 
also have a 4 x 24 x 1/8 inch thick plastiform
magnet with a gauss strength of 2,450.

These magnets can be used either continuously 
during this withdrawal phase or used just at the
time that you experience the withdrawal symptoms.
It usually requires 10 to 30 minutes for magnetic 
management of the symptoms. First, place the ceramic 
disc magnets on each temple area, that is, in front 
and at the level of the top of the ears. These can
be held in place with a 2 x 26 inch self-fastening
band. Other placements that may be found to be 
helpful, are a left temple and low occipital area 
or a left temple and frontal area. The left temple
is used in a right-handed person, and the right 
temple is used in the left-handed person. At the 
same time, place a 5 x 6 x 1/2 inch ceramic block
magnet on the mid- sternum, that is, the middle 
of the chest, on the front. Also, a 4 x 6 x1/2 inch 
thick magnet should be placed directly over the 
epigastric area, which is just below the sternum.
These can be held in place by a 4 x 52 inch body
wrap or an Ace bandage, or if you are lying down,
these magnets can just rest on these areas. You
may find it helpful, or even necessary, to use 
the 4 x 24 inch plastiform magnet down the spine.
You would need to be lying down to do this. To
use this magnet, always use the negative magnetic
field. After this acute phase is over, use these
magnets to relieve symptoms if and when they re-occur.
The rotation diet should become a life style.  
You should also sleep on a magnetic bed pad and with 
magnets at the crown of your head.

will find out how to manage food and other addictions 
that play such a major role in the development of 
degenerative diseases.

Section 5   	 	Arthritis and "Snake Oil"
		
			By Joe Carr, Ph.D., C.N.C.

	page; http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html
----------

Arthritis may be the oldest and most treated disease in the
history of mankind. You don't have to look it up in a
dictionary to find its definition if you suffer from it.
It's one of those ailments in life that you live with for
years as a minor inconvenience and suddenly, or at least so
it seems, it grows into a full-blown and debilitating
"condition" that rules your every waking moment. Much snake
oil, tonics and potions have been created with a promise of
curing this disease and as a testament to the pain of the
disease, the makers of the "cures" have never lacked a
market that readily buys the promised elixirs.

In simple terms, arthritis is an inflammation of the joints
with accompanying pain, swelling and stiffness. It typically
strikes older people and the most common form is
osteoarthritis. More than 80 percent of Americans over the
age of 50 suffer from it to some degree and it is the
leading cause of physical disability in the U.S. The
standard medical treatment is the use of NSAIDs
(nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs). Commonly prescribed
NSAIDs include Ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin),
Indomethacin (Indocin, Indometh, Naprosyn), Fenoprofen
(Nalfon), Meclofenamate (Meclomen, Meclofen) and aspirin.
Aspirin may be effective initially but, as the condition
worsens, the dosage has to be increased. This often creates
unpleasant side effects such as ringing in the ears,
gastrointestinal irritation and blood thinning. While the
other NSAIDs are better tolerated than aspirin, they are not
necessarily more effective. They are costly and when used
over long periods of time and in certain dosages can pose
significant health risks.

Another treatment is the use of corticosteroids but this
poses even greater health risks. Only in cases where a
physician has determined that it is absolutely necessary
should steroid drugs be used. Ironically, long-term use of
steroid drugs can weaken bone structure and actually cause
arthritic-like conditions in some people.

Into this fray enter a relatively new supplement,
glucosamine sulfate. Glucosamine has some exciting prospects
as a natural and safe treatment of osteoarthritis and other
inflammatory joint conditions. It is a naturally occurring
amino-monosaccharide whose primary purpose is to stimulate
the production of cartilage components (necessary to keep
the joints functioning and in a state of constant repair)
and prompts the production of connective tissue. Connective
tissue is what keeps us from falling apart - it is the
fibrous material that holds our bones together and is the
main component of cartilage. Certain parts of the body -
tendons and cartilage - are made completely of connective
tissue.

The body recognizes glucosamine as a natural substance. It
does not suppress or stimulate normal cellular function but
enhances the physiological processes which have deteriorated
with age (which causes the gradual destruction of cartilage
stores). Glucosamine is a non-toxic, natural substance that
treats the origin and cause of the disease as opposed to
masking the symptoms, as pharmaceutical drugs do -- it acts
like a healing agent instead of a simple pain reliever.
Additionally, it also contributes to the repair of joints
that have deteriorated.

Glucosamine is not a direct anti-inflammatory because it
does not initiate a direct pain-killing effect. While it
does have anti-inflammatory properties, glucosamine goes
directly to the cause and controls inflammation by assisting
in the healing and regeneration of damaged tissue. NSAIDs
only target arthritic symptoms and do not address the cause. 

A study in 1991 indicated that compared with the health
risks of NSAIDs, glucosamine is 10 to 30 times more
desirable in its therapeutic actions when compared to its
safety. Another study conducted in the same year stated that
glucosamine seemed "comparable or superior to that of the
known NSAIDs (Setnikar, 1991)." Numerous other studies and
trials have also indicated the use of glucosamine sulfate 
as not only a safer alternative to NSAIDs but even more
effective.

Already widely used in Europe, the combination of
glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate has been
remarkably effective in treating osteoarthritis. These
elements work together in such a manner to initiate the
production of new cartilage while protecting existing
cartilage tissue. They treat the disease at its root and do
not mask the symptoms. These two components work
synergistically: where one is weak the other excels.
Glucosamine stimulates the production of cartilage, provides
joint lubrication and helps to reduce pain and inflammation.
Chondroitin boosts cartilage synthesis, inhibits the enzymes
that destroy cartilage molecules, promotes cellular
nourishment and contributes to joint protection. Combined,
glucosamine and chondroitin may offer the single most
effective answer to the thousands suffering with arthritis.

Anyone considering glucosamine and chondroitin should also
consider other natural substances to complement and enhance
the effectiveness of this therapy. Manganese (enhances
effectiveness), vitamin C (cartilage repair), vitamin E
(antioxidant and inhibits the breakdown of enzymes found in
cartilage), proanthocyanidins (anti-inflammatory compound
more powerful than vitamins C and E), white willow bark
(anti-inflammatory and useful for joint and muscle pain), 
and Cat's Claw (inhibits inflammation, antioxidant).

Jason Theodosakis, M.D., author of the best selling The
Arthritis Cure, recommends using the glucosamine and
chondroitin combination to lower one's risk of developing
osteoarthritis as well as to treat a current condition. He
also recommends manganese and vitamin C to help boost the
effects of the two. According to Dr. Theodosakis, the best
way to determine dosage is based on your body's weight: less
than 120 pounds - 1000mg glucosamine/800mg chondroitin; 120
- 200 pounds - 1500mg glucosamine/1200mg chondroitin; 200+
pounds - 2000mg glucosamine/1600mg chondroitin. He
recommends adjusting the dosages according to results and
advises taking the supplements in two to four doses spread
out during the course of a day. The supplements can be taken
with or without food.

Finally, don't forget what you eat - it affects the way you
feel. Do eat foods rich in bioflavonoids: blueberries,
blackberries and cherries; phytochemicals such as onions,
garlic, cabbage and Brussels sprouts; lots of fresh, raw
vegetables except for potatoes, peppers, tomatoes and
eggplant. Avoid meats, sugar (all forms), dairy products,
eggs, soda pop, carbonated beverages and alcohol, saturated
fats, breads and pastas and tobacco.

Patience is the key word in any therapy. Do not expect the
"overnight cure." The time for the effectiveness of
glucosamine and chondroitin will be longer than the quick
action of NSAIDs. However, once it has established itself it
should provide a superior source of treatment, even when
compared to strong medications such as Ibuprofen.

----------

The origins of arthritic conditions range from metabolic 
disorders brought on by stress and poor environment, to 
adrenal exhaustion, faulty elimination, an over acid 
system, long emotional resentments and pessimism about 
life, and over use of prescription drugs. 

The common thread of natural treatment is improvement in 
diet and nutrition  allowing the body to heal itself by 
changing the terrain. 

As arthritic conditions can be a result in part, of acidic 
body chemistry, we would like to try and alkalize the body 
which in turn can allow healing to proceed. 


Black Bean Soup

This soup is purifying, strengthening, and most importantly 
alkalizing, with protein for healing. 

Makes ten servings.

Soak 2 1/2 cups dried black beans in 10 cups of water overnight. 

Saute 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 chopped onion in 2 tbs 
of oil until very brown. 

Add and bring to a boil in a large stock pot;

The soaked beans.
2 tbs dark miso paste.
9 cups of vegetable stock or bouillon.
1 cup of water.
1 cup rose¹ wine.	

Reduce heat.  Simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 to 2 hours stirring 
occasionally. Keep the beans covered with liquid. Remove from 
heat to cool slightly. Puree soup in the blender in batches 
and return to the pot. 

Add 1/4 cup of madiera or marsala wine, 
1 teaspoon black pepper, and 
1 teaspoon of sea salt.
Serve in bowls topped with crumbled hard boiled eggs and 
lemon slices.
