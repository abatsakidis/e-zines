                     Letter from the Editor 

    Well, summer vacation is drawing to a close. The 
children are getting ready for school, and moms are 
getting ready for a "break"! :) 

    Again our practitioners have got some terrific articles 
to share with you today. We've gotten a significant amount 
of email expressing enthusiasm about Your Life-Your Choice's 
upcoming enhancements. I'm glad there's so much excitement 
about them. We're working hard to line up practitioners for 
seminars, testing software, and gathering credible sources for 
newsfeeds.

    There's a great deal of work involved in pulling all of this 
together. But we are working hard to make it available soon.
If you know of a certified practitioner who would like the 
challenge and exposure of conducting an online seminar in 
their field of expertise, have them contact us at:
mailto:yourlife@life-choices.com. We also still have a couple 
of spots available for moderating our new message board.
This is also a terrific opportunity to position yourself with 
credibility and to gain exposure and experience. If you're 
interested and want to know a little more about what's 
involved, send us an email.

    Until next time Your Life-Your Choice wishes you
health and prosperity.

Section 2    Negative Magnetic Field Production 
                          of Melatonon  (part one)

The Negative Magnetic Field Production of Melatonin is presented in 
a  3-part series. In part one you will learn facts about melatonin, and 
the role of the pineal gland in its production.  Part two will help you 
understand the role your eyes, your gastrointestinal tract and your 
growth hormones play in melatonin production and part three 
will show you how magnetic therapy can not only enhance the entire 
process, but override everyday factors that inhibit your production of 
melatonin. 

          THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MELATONIN 

Melatonin is the central hormone controlling the entire energy system 
of the body. This includes hormonal function, immune function, enzyme 
function, oxidative function and in fact all energy functions of the body. 
Melatonin is the only transducer the body has. It can tone down areas 
that are excessive and step up areas that need reinforcement. It can 
remove energy from one area over to another. Melatonin is a great 
normalizer of biological body functions. In performing its many tasks, 
it controls the aging process and the degenerative disease processes. 
It is wise for anyone seeking health, happiness, and longevity to be 
studying the numerous benefits of melatonin. 

                         FACTS ABOUT MELATONIN 

1.  Melatonin regulates the entire energy system of the human body. 

2.  Melatonin regulates the immune system. 

3.  Melatonin regulates the hormonal system 

4.  Melatonin is anti-stress in its effect. 

5.  Melatonin is antibiotic in its effect. 

6.  Melatonin is anti-cancerous in its effect. 

7.  Melatonin is anti-free radical in its effect. 

8.  Melatonin is anti-aging in its effect. 

9. Melatonin controls central nervous system excitatory activity, 
thus aiding in the control of mental symptoms and seizures. 

      THE ROLE OF THE PINEAL GLAND IN 
              MELATONIN PRODUCTION 

The pineal gtand is the shape and size of a kernel of corn 
and is directly in the center of your head on a stalk in the 
third ventricle. The pineal gland produces melatonin. The 
condition under which it produces melatonin is that there 
is no light, and no 6O cycle per second pulsing frequency 
from AC electric currents. Deep energy restoring sleep is 
necessary for the production of melatonin. It is important 
to know that the pineal gland also produces, serotonin and 
a thyrotropin releasing hormone which in turn stimulates the 
pituitary to produce a thyroid stimulating hormone. It is 
important to know that a negative magnetic field stimulates 
the pineal gland to produce melatonin while a positive 
magnetic field inhibits the production of melatonin. 

               FACTS ABOUT THE PINEAL GLAND 

1.  The pineal gland is situated in the center of the head on 
     a stalk in the third ventricle. 

2. The pineal gland is the size and shape of a kernel of corn. 

3.  Pinealocytes are the hormone producing cells. 

4.  Pinealocytes produce serotonin from the amino acid 
     tryptophane. 

5. Pinealocytes produce melatonin from serotonin plus 
     tryptophane. 

6.  It is characteristic that melatonin production by the pineal 
     gland gradually decreases with aging. 

7. It is characteristic that the pineal gland gradually calcifies 
     with aging. This calcification of the pineal gland parallels 
     the reduction of melatonin production by the pineal gland. 

8. The pineal gland produces melatonin in the dark, during 
     sleep. 

9. A 60-cycle per second pulsing frequency stops the pineal 
     gland production of melatonin. 

10. Light in the eyes or forehead stops the production of 
      melatonin by the pineal gland. 

11. A negative magnetic field stimulates the pineal gland to 
      produce melatonin. 

12. A positive magnetic field stops the pineal gland from 
      producing melatonin. 

13. The enzyme, serotonin -N- acetyltransferace, producing 
      melatonin is alkaline dependant. 

Next month in Part two, you will understand the role your eyes, 
your gastrointestinal tract and your growth hormones play in 
melatonin production

Section 4    FIBROMYALGIA: A HOLISTIC APPROACH 
                 by Andrea Lemieux, RNCP 
                mailto:newvital@istar.ca

         Read about Andrea Lemieux on our Meet the Team 
             page; http://www.Life-Choices.com/team.html 

A person who hurts everywhere, joints, bones, muscles, tendons, 
may be given any number of labels for their symptoms: arthritis, 
rheumatism, lumbago, polymyalgia rheumatica, gout, ankylosing 
spondylitis, and fibromyalgia. 

To diagnose fibromyalgia, doctors need to find sensitivity in at 
least 11 out of 18 itender points.i These areas, all where muscles 
attach to ligaments or bones, will exhibit pain with just the pressure 
of a thumb. People who have it suffer from pain day in and day 
out, all over their bodies -- plus fatigue, anxiety and depression. 
Other disorders such as hepatitis, Lyme disease, anemia, arthritic 
conditions, and depression, must be ruled out before a firm 
diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be made. 

Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are closely associated 
with one another. Both seem to begin after an infection or severe 
physical or emotional shock. In chronic fatigue, the patient will 
feel fatigue most; in fibromyalgia, the dominant symptom will be 
muscular pain. 

Fibromyalgia commonly occurs with other conditions, such as 
allergies, anxiety, toxicity, candida, PMS, irritable bowel 
syndrome, and viral infections. For the successful treatment of 
this often debilitating condition, a holistic approach is essential. 

As improbable as it may seem to the sufferer, the best 
recommendation is a steady program of moderate aerobic 
exercise. Without exercise, there will rarely be any improvement. 
It will be difficult, but the patient must push themselves to do it. 
They must start slowly, only three to five minutes a day, and pick 
exercises that do not use the most painful muscles. Gradually 
increase to 20 to 30 minutes three or more days a week. The 
methods of exercise best suited to fibromyalgia patients are 
said to be cycling (static cycle), walking, or swimming. 

Stress seems to be a major factor in this disease, relaxation 
techniques such as meditation, progressive relaxation and 
breathing exercises are critical. 

Nutrition is most important; the following recommendations 
will make an enormous difference in overcoming this condition. 
* Eat a high-fibre diet including six or more servings of 
vegetables daily; green vegetables are of prime importance. 
* Make sure your diet includes protein at most meals. Fish, 
poultry, and raw nuts and seeds in particular. Protein is 
necessary for maintenance and repair of all tissues in the body. 
* Eat four or five small meals daily to keep a steady supply of 
protein and carbohydrates available for proper muscle function. 
If the body does not have enough fuel for energy, it will rob the 
muscles of essential nutrients, causing muscle wasting and pain. 
* Do not eat red meat, dairy products, or any other foods that 
are high in saturated fats. Saturated fats promote inflammation 
and increase pain; also avoid fried food and rancid fats and oils 
of all kinds. 
* Avoid polyunsaturated vegetable oils like safflower, sunflower, 
soy, corn, and sesame, and oils that have been refined or made 
saturated by the process of hydrogenation, such as margarine, 
and manufactured mayonnaise and salad dressings. The fats that 
will reduce inflammation are in cold water fish, raw nuts and 
seeds, flaxseed oil and ground, raw flaxseeds. Extra-virgin olive 
oil is also a healthy and acceptable oil. 
* Avoid processed foods and white flour products such as bread 
and pasta. 
* Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugar. These substances enhance 
fatigue, increase muscle pain, and can interfere with normal sleep 
patterns. 
* Drink eight glasses of pure water daily. Herbal tea can be a part 
of this intake. A plentiful intake of liquids is important for flushing 
out toxins. 
* Investigate the possibility that food allergies and/or sensitivities 
may be contributing to the situation. Dairy and wheat allergies are 
particularly implicated in many cases of fibromyalgia and similar 
conditions. 

There are many supplements and physical therapies that are 
beneficial to fibromyalgia patients. It is important to work 
closely with a health care practitioner to find ways to gently 
detoxify the patient, while at the same time supporting and 
helping him or her to relieve the pain. Acupuncture or 
electroacupuncture has an excellent track record in treating 
pain.  Magnesium has long been considered helpful because 
it promotes muscle relaxation. Magnesium is available in nuts, 
legumes, whole grains, and dark green vegetables. Malic 
Acid has also been found useful in treating this condition. 
Malic Acid is naturally present in apples. 
 
Below is an especially delicious recipe for baked apples. 
The malic acid in apples will not only benefit the person 
with fibromyalgia, but it will also remedy indigestion 
because it inhibits fermentation and the growth of disease- 
producing bacteria in the digestive tract.

                Curried Sweet Potato and Apple Soup 

With the end of August upon us, we can begin to think about 
warming soups, using the produce of the season. This soup 
combines apple and sweet potato. You can substitute the 
sweet potato with winter squash, or use half squash and half 
sweet potato. Kobacha squash is particularly good as it is 
dense and sweet. 

Serves 5 - 6 

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or ghee 
3 leeks, white part only, well washed and chopped 
1 medium onion, chopped 
2 medium carrots, chopped 
2 large cloves garlic, chopped 
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root 
4#189# cups vegetable or chicken broth (homemade, salt free) 
1#189# pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1i cubes 
1 medium Granny Smith apple, cored, peeled and cubed 
1 teaspoon curry powder 
Celtic sea salt and pepper to taste 

1. Heat the oil or ghee over medium heat in a soup pot. Add 
onion, garlic, ginger root and leeks, sautee about 5 minutes, 
until onions are transluscent. 
2. Add remaining ingredients, stir. 
3. Cover, bring to a light boil, reduce heat to low. Cook until 
potatoes are tender, about 1 hour. 
4. Puree in batches in food processor, return to pot and heat 
through before serving.
