	This is the time of year where colds, viruses, and 
dampness cause our little ones so much pain. In particular 
during the winter months ear infections run rampant.

	Ear infections are a result of either bacteria or 
viruses that invade the middle ear. This is the area located 
just behind the eardrum. In acute cases of ear infections pus 
builds up inside the middle ear causing pressure, inflammation, 
and considerable pain. As pus and pressure increase, the 
eardrum becomes inflamed and red, and it stops vibrating 
normally. This usually causes some temporary hearing loss. 
Ear infections (otitis media) are a very common occurance among 
children. In fact, two out of three children have at least one 
episode by the time they reach 3 years of age. And 20-40 % of 
children under the age of six share these experiences. As a 
precaution, ALL ear infection cases should be seen by your 
local certified health care provider.

	In the case of an acute infection, the child may also 
have a fever and pain. You may see an infant or small child 
pulling at their ears. Other times, an infection may develop 
gradually, making it difficult to know if the child has fluid 
in the middle ear. Signs which may indicate the presence of 
chronic or recurring fluid are: inattentiveness, turning the TV 
louder, difficulty following directions, pulling or scratching 
at the ears, listlessness or irritability, and delayed speech 
and language skills.

	Echinacea encourages a healthy immune system which can 
be very helpful in dealing with ear infections. Ear drops made 
with Mullein, St. John's Wort, and Garlic in an oil base are 
traditional remedies to ease the pressure in the middle ear. A 
few drops of Oil of Calendula on a cotton swab can also help to 
relieve painful earaches. Goldenseal is a natural antibiotic 
and an immune system booster. It has a long history of use for 
infections, including recurrent ear infections. Although any of 
these may be helpful in clearing up an ear infection, you are 
wise to see your local health care provider for proper dosages 
for your child and to ensure that there are no other health 
issues or medications that can conflict with the recommended 
treatment.

Wellness - or, simply put, good health - is not necessarily 
the result of what you put into your mouth. The extensive 
research of Joel M. Teutsch and Champion K. Teutsch has shown 
the real cause of sickness or other conditions:

an adverse mind factor and unfavorable genetic predisposition. 
They have learned to modify them for their clients' benefit. 
This does not invalidate the use of diet, vitamins and medication. 
It merely enhances their potent affects on the consumer.

Section 4           The Psychological Aspects of TMJ

                         by Jacob Trager, DDS
        <A HREF="http://www.dentalwellness.net/">
            http://www.dentalwellness.net/</B></A>
                            888-758-8058

Jacob Trager, DDS, a 1962 honor graduate of the University 
of Maryland School of Dentistry, was a leader in preventive 
dentistry during the late 1960s. Recognizing the relationship 
of the mouth with the total person, Dr. Trager trained in the 
whole person psychological concept called Psychosynthesis, to 
facilitate the integration of the mind and body. He is also a 
licensed massage therapist (LMT) specializing in craniosacral 
therapy (a gentle manipulative technique that assists the 
body in maintaining and regaining balance).
 
----------      
  	If you are experiencing TMJ symptoms, it is important 
to not just treat the symptoms.  We believe this for all 
diseases but especially in reference to TMJ. The jaw has 
psychological significance and is the most difficult part 
of the body to relax. The jaw is also one of the areas where 
people have a tendency to hold or repress feelings. If you 
are experiencing a chronic emotional stressor in your life, 
the body usually responds with muscle tension. Your response 
of muscle tension will counteract the treatment process. A major part of TMJ treatment is relaxation of the muscles of 
the jaws, head, face and neck. It is important to be aware 
of your emotional self and any situations that may be 
contributing to your symptoms of TMJ. The following are 
examples of situations that may be contributing:

1) Lack of assertiveness in expressing yourself and your 
feelings.
2) Feeling depressed.
3) Low self-esteem; not feeling good about yourself.
4) Living in and with an unhappy relationship.
5) Dissatisfaction with your profession or job.
6) Loss of a loved one.

There are many others. These are just examples for you to 
begin the process of awareness. These are all chronic 
stressors and your body may respond with any or all of 
the following symptoms:

muscle tension
tension headaches
muscle spasms of the jaw, face, neck and back
pain
irritability
mood swings
clenching and/or grinding of your teeth
tongue or cheek biting 
and many others.

If your should choose to treat only the above symptoms and 
the chronic stressor remains in your life, you will, in 
essence, be working against yourself rather that enhancing 
the healing process by attempting to resolve contributing 
factors. As you can see, there is a strong interrelationship 
between TMJ dysfunction and psychological stressors. This is 
why we strongly suggest the importance of exploring and 
working with your emotional self in conjunction with the 
physical symptoms when receiving treatment for TMJ 
dysfunction. In determining what emotional factors may be 
operating for you, it is important to remember to treat 
yourself with love, trusting that you can work through 
this and that you do have alternatives.

	The body manifests symptoms when there is stress 
overload. These symptoms are the body's messages that your 
awareness and attention is needed. Our belief is that 
illness and/or pain is the body's attempt to cope and 
therefore a positive message because the body is trying 
to reestablish balance and harmony. Pain is an early 
warning signal and its message is important and needs 
to be explored rather than numbed, ignored or repressed.

Our recommendation is to treat physically as stated above 
and psychologically with psychotherapy and a relaxation 
stress-management program.

	It is a scary thing when you cannot breathe. Imagine 
the feeling of drowning, or literally  "gasping for air". That 
is the picture of what many asthmatics have to deal with on 
a daily basis. In the US, some 15 million people are effected 
by this disease, 5 million of which are children. This number 
has doubled during the last 10 years and many researchers are 
both puzzled and concerned as to the reasons why.

	Asthma can strike anyone at any time, though children 
appear to be the most vulnerable. There is strong evidence of 
an inherited tendency to being allergic to allergens in the 
air. Those that develop allergies are more likely to develop 
asthma. Many children will outgrow asthma; others will face a 
lifetime of asthma management.

	The airways of an asthmatic are hyper-responsive to 
environmental triggers or allergens. There are a host of 
asthma "triggers," or substances in the environment that can 
set off asthma attacks. Some triggers cause an allergic 
reaction, a full-fledged immune response in someone whose 
immune systems is overly sensitive to normally harmless 
substances like pollen, or dust. Others directly irritate the 
lining of the airways and some do both. During an asthma attack 
the lining of the airways become swollen and filled with 
mucous. The muscles around the airway tighten, constricting 
airflow. Symptoms such as coughing wheezing and chest 
tightening can usually be relieved by a bronchodilator (such as 
VentolinAE). But the airway inflammation can remain, leaving the 
asthmatic vulnerable to many more attacks.


Why the increase?
Although no one knows for sure, there are a number of theories 
as to why asthma is on the rise:

1. Spending more time indoors, exposing one to more allergens 
and triggers. During the last decade we have built tighter, 
more energy efficient buildings. This has led to less natural 
air exchange, less ventilation and more build up of potentially 
harmful substances.  
2. Homes are carpeted and have cloth furnishings. These are 
ideal places for dust, dust mites and other known allergens to 
live and breed.  
3. Air Pollution, both indoors and out. Especially exposure to 
smoke.

	Every asthmatic needs a plan of action designed to help 
manage their asthma. This usually includes strong medications 
such as oral and inhaled steroids, airflow monitoring (so one 
knows if an asthma attack is pending.) And effective control 
of environmental triggers.


AVOIDING ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS AND IRRITANTS

Controlling the home environment is a very important part of 
asthma and allergy care. 


DUST AND DUST MITES

Encasing mattresses, pillows, and box springs with allergy 
resistant protective covers.
Remove or regularly wash and clean dust catchers; stuffed 
animals, cloth blinds, knick knacks etc.
A vacuum cleaner with an air filter or a central vacuum. 
Wash all bedding on 130+ degrees each week.


POLLENS AND MOLDS

Thoroughly clean bathrooms and other high moisture areas to 
reduce mold growth. Consider using mold protective sealers 
Immediate fixes all leaks, or water damaged areas. If Humidity 
is above 45%, consider a dehumidifier to reduce excessive 
moisture in the air. High levels of moisture lead to dust 
mite and mold proliferation. Keep windows closed during peak 
pollen times. Especially between 5am-10am.  


ANIMAL DANDER

Keep animals from bedrooms.  
Wash animals frequently.  


COCKROACH DROPPINGS

Through cleaning of kitchen, putting away food promptly. 
Utilize bait/traps. Avoid use of strong chemicals if possible, 
as they can also be a trigger,


TOBACCO SMOKE

Never allow smoking in the home or anywhere near an asthmatic 


STRONG CHEMICAL FRAGRANCES OR SPRAYS

Utilize non-toxic, fragrance free products as much as possible, 
including household cleaners, deodorizers and the like.


Use HVAC air filters, air conditioners, and air cleaners to 
make your home cleaner and more comfortable.
