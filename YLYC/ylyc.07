Your Life-Your Choice                                     April, 1998
====================                               issue 7

    We meet again for yet another issue of Your Life-Your Choice.
I must apologize for sending both a text version and an html version
of the last issue. That was a major oopser. When we
acquired our own Domain name we also acquired new email
software. As you can tell, we're still getting accustomed to all of the
features that came with it.

    Now for some TERRIFIC news! Many of you have sent in email
asking about Dowsing and how it benefits certain health issues. Well, I'm
certainly not an expert in this field. So I thought I had better find us
one.
So search I did, until I came upon this lovely gentleman in Ireland who
is both an experienced Dowser and lecturer. He has a passion for this
particular discipline that comes across clearly in his writings. Your
Life-Your Choice has arranged for him to share his in-depth knowledge
with us over a four part series.
    The first part will be published in issue 8 of Your Life-Your Choice.
You won't find this series any where else in the world! This is being
written specifically for YOU through Your Life-Your Choice. So, if
you have friends or family that haven't subscribed yet, tell them to get
on board NOW! They won't want to miss this series. See you then!

Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

    My husband, Jim is in the retail industry and travels the
majority of the week. He has a very stressful job and leads
a sedentary lifestyle. His time at home usually consisted of
eating his meals, laying on the floor to watch television and
falling asleep 'till 11 pm, then move to bed and continue the
same. His snoring was a wee bit annoying.
    I found an herbal formula containing White Willow, Kelp,
and Mahuang; and he's been taking that. He has also added
a combination including Scullcap, Valerian Root, B Complex,
and hops. Now, he no longer falls asleep on the floor. When
he does go to bed he no longer snores. He feels so good that
he has taken over many of the jobs around the house that I
used to do. He's lost many inches and pounds and looks
terrific. I think I'll keep him.

Dear Your Life-Your Choice,

Two years ago I developed eczema on my arm. I think it was
due to stress. As time went by it progressed to almost covering
my arm. Finally I went to the doctor and he said that I had a
chronic case of Dermatitis, and would have to see a specialist,
who would probable put me on high doses of Prednisone and
maybe even want to take a biopsy. This scared me a lot. I
started to read my herb books and make phone calls as to
what I should take. I started on Red Clover and a formula
that included Dandelion Root, more Red Clover, Echinacea,
Yellow Dock, and Red Beet Root. Within a week and a half
it was 70% improved. Within 3 weeks it had completely healed.

 ----------

The top income, the best job title: these markers are no
longer the standard of success. So reports CNBC's show
Power Lunch recently. This show reviewed results of a
survey indicating the top priority for business school
graduates now is a balance between family life and work.

Natural cycles awareness helps us get on the balanced-life
track. This month we look at one part of natural timing, the
retrograde motion of planets.

As viewed from earth, the planets sometimes appear to be
traveling backward. This backward travel, called retrograde
motion, is a phenomena recognized in both astronomy and
astrology.

Retrograde motions are about patience. They are times
when our plans to go forward are halted. Retrograde
periods are times to bring play and family into the forefront
of our lives. During retrograde periods we are reworking
plans. We are going backward to get something we
overlooked -- an idea, an opportunity. These kinds of
creative discoveries are best realized through the spontaneity
of play and the supportive comfort of family and friends.

Mercury, one of the planets in our solar system, goes
retrograde three times a year. Energetically, Mercury is
associated with communication, technology, and things
which are mechanical. Retrograde periods of Mercury are
the times when miscommunications, delays, or technical and
mechanical challenges seem prevalent.

Just picture it: energy is trying to go backward and we are
trying to go forward. Something has to give. You can guess
it is not going to be the planet that gives, in this case
Mercury. The planet is going to go it's way. We can either
be aggravated, impatient, frustrated. Or, we can stop and
reassess.

With knowledge of Mercury retrograde periods we can stop
personalizing delays. We can start cushioning expectations,
knowing we can only go so far when the motion is not
forward. We can take the pressure off of over-work and
bring in a little play.

Mercury turned retrograde on April 14. On May 8 1997,
Mercury turns in a forward motion again. The point where
Mercury turned retrograde on April 14 is called a station.
Mercury passes this station on May 26. For the three week
period when Mercury is retrograde one may expect natural
delays and possible communication, technological or
mechanical challenges. When Mercury turns direct on May 8
these matters start to clear up. When Mercury passes it's
station on May 26 one can expect forward motion in the
areas of communication and technology.

We have another retrograde energy we are dealing with
now, Mars retrograde. Mars is the planet of drive and
initiative. Many people have been experiencing delays in
their work and the forward motion of projects.

On February 6 of this year Mars turned retrograde. Mars
turns direct on April 29. On July 2, Mars passes it's station,
the point where it turned retrograde in early February.
During this Mars retrograde period we have the opportunity
to come to a deeper sense of what energizes us -- what we
want. As plans are delayed we keep refining them. After
April 29, and especially after July 2, we will start to feel
forward momentum again. This motion forward is in the
areas of our personal power within business and
relationships.

"How can planetary motion possibly affect my business?" is
a question I am sure some readers will ask. The new physics
teaches us gravity is not the only force in nature. Through
electromagnetism and strong and weak forces the new
physics tells us that everything in nature is interconnected. As
above, so below.

Paying attention to the information of natural cycles helps us
feel part of, rather than separate from, the fluid movement of
energy. We can move with the natural clock, rather than
against it. Check out the events of your life in relation to the
dates mentioned above. See if there are links. If you do not
see a match, that is fine, too. No one world view is for
everyone.

Section 5            Gotu Kola - The Spiritual Herb
Reprint permission granted by Kelly Smith from Frontier Herbs
                            http://www.frontierherb.com/

Gotu kola, Centella Asiatic, is one of the herbs known in
Ayurveda as Brahmi - that which aids knowledge of Supreme
Reality. In India it is regarded as perhaps the most spiritual of
all herbs. Growing in some areas of the Himalayas, gotu kola
is used by yogis to improve meditation. It is said to develop
the crown cakra, the energy center at the top of the head, and
to balance the right and left hemispheres of the brain, which
the leaf is said to resemble. It is regarded as one of the most
important rejuvenative herbs in Ayurveda.

Gotu kola is a slender, creeping plant that grows commonly
in swampy areas of India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, South
Africa and the tropics. Depending on the environment, the
form and shape of gotu kola can change dramatically. In
shallow water it will form floating leaves; in dry locations the
leaves are small and thin with numerous roots. Gotu kola is
related to carrot, parsley , dill and fennel, but does not have
their feathery leaves or umbrellas of tiny flowers. Instead its
creeping stem grows in marshy areas and produces fan shaped
leaves about the size of an old British penny - hence its
common names Indian pennywort, marsh penny and water
pennywort.

Traditional Information

Gotu kola has been widely used for a number of conditions,
particularly in traditional Eastern health care. Sri Lankans
noticed that elephants, renowned for their longevity, munched
on the leaves of the plant. Thus the leaves became known as
a promoter of long life. In China its reputation as a longevity
herb stems from the report of the Chinese herbalist LiChing
Yun, who reportedly lived 256 years. His long life was
attributed to his regular use of an herbal mixture composed
chiefly of gotu kola. It has traditionally been used as an aid
for developing memory and intelligence. By stimulating brain
tissues, it is said to expand understanding and comprehension.
It has al so been used to calm the mind.

In Ayurveda gotu kola is one of the chief herbs for revitalizing
the nerves and brain cells. It is said to fortify the immune
system, both cleansing and feeding it, and to strengthen the
adrenals. It has been used as a pure blood tonic and for skin
health. It has also been used to promote restful sleep.
According to Ayurveda, gotu kola is a tonic and rejuvenative
for pitta (fire) types. It also inhibits vata (air) conditions when
balanced with warming herbs, calms the nerves, and helps
reduce excessive kapha (earth & water) conditions. In
Traditional Chinese Medicine it is considered a yin tonic.
There is an ancient Sinhalese proverb about gotu kola:
"Two leaves a day will keep old age away."

Modern Research

According to modern studies, gotu kola does offer support
for healthy memory function. A study conducted in 1992 by
K. Nalini at Kasturba Medical College showed an impressive
improvement in memory in rats which were treated with the
extract (orally) daily for 14 days before the experiment. The
retention of learned behavior in the rats treated with gotu kola
was three to 60 times better than that in control animals.
Preliminary results in one clinical trial with mentally retarded
children was shown to increase scores on intelligence tests
(Bagchi, 1989). This does not mean gotu kola will improve
intelligence for all special or normal children.

According to pharmacological studies, one outcome of gotu
kola's complex actions is a balanced effect on cells and tissues
participating in the process of healing, particularly connective
tissues. One of its constituents, asiaticoside, works to stimulate
skin repair and strengthen skin, hair, nails and connective
tissue (Kartnig, 1988).

Scientific studies have also shown that in relatively large doses
the alcoholic extract produces a sedative effect, caused by the
saponin glycosides.

Section 5  WHAT'S THAT SCENT REMIND YOU OF?

----------

Fresh cut grass, wildflowers, grapefruit ... does the very
mention of these scents bring back memories and emotions?
That's aromatherapy! Aromatherapy uses the essential oils
extracted from plants to create scents that can have a positive
effect on mind, body and spirit.

Most people think of aromatherapy as a modern day
phenomenon. But it dates back more than 4,000 years to
aromatic medicinal practices in Egypt and India. The
Egyptians created massage oils, medicines, embalming
preparations, skin care products, fragrant perfumes and
cosmetics with aromatic plants. Throughout the Middle and
Dark Ages, people in Persia, Greece, Rome, China and
Europe used aromatics.

Modern day aromatherapy got its start in the 1920s thanks to
French cosmetic chemist R.M. Gattefosse. He discovered
the benefits of aromatic essential oils after burning his arm in
a laboratory accident. Gattefosse thrust his burned hand into
the nearest available cool liquid, a vat of lavender oil. After
his remarkable and speedy recovery with little scarring or
pain, Gattefosse spent the rest of his life studying aromatic
plants and their benefits. Today, aromatherapy is so well-
accepted in some European countries, that it is widely
prescribed by the mainstream medical profession and in
some cases medical insurance covers its cost.

Aromatherapy Gets Back To Nature

Aromatherapy uses pure, all natural essential oils. These
essential oils give plants their fragrance. Most essential oils
are steam distilled from plants, others are expressed from
the rind of the fruit. Only 20 percent of flowering plants have
extractable essential oils.

Essential oils contain hundreds of organic constituents,
including hormones, vitamins and other natural elements.
Synthetic fragrance oils, made possible by recent advances
in chemistry, contain only enough constituents to make the
substance scented. Because they have a different chemistry,
synthetic fragrances don't duplicate the scent or benefits of
the natural aromatic plants.

Anyone Can Develop a Nose for Aromatherapy

With a little knowledge of essential oils, anyone can create
blends that provide physical and emotional benefits. The art
of aromatherapy is finding the right combination of essential
oils to produce unique life-enhancing aromas. For example,
the right combination of lemon, juniper berry, frankincense,
myrrh and cedarwood creates a meditative and relaxing
mood.

Essential oils are so highly concentrated, a few drops will
create the desired effect. You must always dilute essential oils
in either water or carrier oil. To apply essential oils to the skin,
use a pure vegetable oil such as almond, grape seed or jojoba.
For baths or air diffusion, dilute the essential oils in water.

Pure essential oils are found at natural food or health stores
in a variety of sizes. Aromatherapy products, which contain
essential oils, include mineral baths, massage and bath oils,
bath soaps, perfumes, body powders and cocoa butters.
Aromatherapy atomizers, electric room diffusers and candle
diffusers are also available.

In the U.S., consumer awareness of the practice of
aromatherapy is at an all-time high. Magazines like Vogue,
Self, Shape, Glamour and Mirabella have published many
articles explaining the benefits of aromatic plants. Sales of
aromatherapy products are growing at a rate of 20 to 30
percent per year, according to a recent Cowboy Marketing
study, valuing the wholesale aromatherapy market at more
than $300 million.

>From the beginning of time people have been using the sense
of smell to enhance their mood. With a little knowledge and
a little experimenting, everyone today can enjoy the benefits
of aromatherapy.

                                    Hey! Don't Hold It!

Putting your body in charge!
A few ideas about using the bathroom when your body urges
you to.

Situations
1) On the phone: excuse yourself and call back.  You can't
really be fully present to the person anyway when you have to
go.
2) When you're at your desk working on something.  No
excuse, just go.
3) Driving.  This can be problematic.  The basic idea is to go
for the first public bathroom available rather than holding it till
you get where you're going.  I know this sounds unreasonable,
but remember, we're talking about subtlety here and your
body knows everything!
4) In a meeting.  I have to admit, before I started this practice
myself, I stayed in meetings for hours busting at the seams.
Now I say, just excuse yourself and go, that's what I do.
Most meetings are an incredible waste of human potential
anyway (but that's another issue :-). Many times, by taking
the initiative, everyone else realizes they need a break too.
5) Caring for small children.  I can't say I've been through this
one myself, but there's got to be a way to ask them to be safe
for a few minutes.

Anything you can do to let your body know that it's in charge,
will expand your intuition and heighten your awareness of the
subtle signals that will keep you well for a life time.

                        Why put your body in charge?

Last week we began a conversation about putting your body
in charge. This is a subtle but critical element in the path to
exceptional health. Another amazing benefit to putting your
body in charge is that your intuition improves dramatically.
One theory is that since the body has more cells than the brain,
you can learn more by feeling than by thinking.  Another
element is that as you feel more - especially love, beauty and
appreciation - your body will inform the brain to release the
hormones that will heal your body.

It all begins with letting your body know that you will:
1) listen
2) do everything you can to care for it.
