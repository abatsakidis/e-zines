Letter From the Editor

My editorial this week is for all of our subscribers who
ever find themselves confused by all the various modalities
of alternative medicine.  Modalities refers to a specific 
holistic practice like reiki or aromatherapy or massage 
therapy. For definitions on various modalites go to:
http://www.life-choices.com/guide.html  We update and add
to these modalities constantly. I am sure wherever you look,
you will keep finding references to new and different 
modalities. I ran across one this week called “Juice Therapy” 
which we added to our guide.  There are three types of juice 
therapy- Green Juices- made from a variety of alfalfa sprouts,
cabbage, kale, dandelion greens, spinach and any other
green vegetables, including wheatgrass. (to sweeten and
dilute your green juice add fresh carrot and apple juice.)
Although green juices have  excellent health benefits,
they should be consumed in moderation. No more than
8 to 10 oz daily.

Vegetable Juices - Fresh vegetables are restorers and
builders, helpful in boosting the immune system, removing
acid waste and balancing the metabolism. They help to
remove excess body fat. Included in this group  are beets,
cabbage, carrot, celery, cucumber, kale, parsley, turnip,
spinach, watercress and wheatgrass. Use lots of carrots,
they are the sweetest of vegetables, and great on their
own or to add a more pleasant taste to other vegetable
mixtures. The strong flavored veggies like broccoli,
celery, onions, parsley, rutabaga, and turnips are used
in small amounts. Add 1 clove of garlic per 2 glasses
of juice.

Fruit Juices:
Help to cleanse the body and include cancer-fighting
antioxidants. You can use any fruit, however remember
to try new combinations. A great cleansing juice is
watermelon (use with rind intact in your juicer). About
10-12 oz a day are recommended.

Remember, the fresher the better. Drink immediately, do
not store for later. Buy organically grown vegetables and
fruit, if you can’t be sure they are organically grown, peel
or thoroughly scrub and wash to remove chemical residues.
You can buy a vegetable wash at health food stores to
remove any chemical residues.  Leave the skin on most
fruits or vegetables, with the exception of grapefruits, 
kiwis, oranges, papayas, peaches and pineapples. The skins 
of oranges and grapefruits are quite bitter. Kiwi and papaya 
are tropical fruits and are not monitored for pesticide use 
in foreign countries. The skins of pineapples are too thick 
to be processed by most juicers. Use your common sense, and 
enjoy. We will provide some recipes in our recipe column this 
week for your enjoyment.

Section 1
 Aspartame: the good, the bad and the ugly
 Article written by Kathy Jimenez


Accidentally discovered in 1965, by James Schlatter a chemist
of the G.D. Searle Company, aspartame is the most widely
used low calorie artificial sweetener sold under the brand
names "NutraSweet", "Equal" and "Spoonful". Currently,
more than 100 million people around the world consume
aspartame-containing products. It is added to Diet soft drinks,
about 1,200 food products, chewing gum, and even children's
vitamins as a sugar substitute. The American Dental
Association has noted it "welcomes the development
and FDA approval of new artificial sweeteners that are
shown to be safe sweetening agents and flavor enhancers
that can be substituted for sugar in the diet". Still, there
are many others that oppose the consumption of
aspartame because they fear it may be the cause of
increasing neurological disorders, birth defects and even
deaths.

FDA toxicologist, the late Dr. Adrian Gross was one of
the specialists on the FDA task force, which participated
(under the direction of the FDA commissioner,
Dr. Schmidt), in the 1975 FDA investigation of the quality
of experimental studies carried out by or for the G.D.
Searle & Company. Dr. Gross as well as the other task
members in the investigation discovered that aspartame
had not been properly evaluated, nor were the procedures
and findings properly documented. In a letter addressed to
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Dr. Gross included two
statements that were recorded in the task force report
dated March 26, 1976. They read as follows: "We have
noted that Searle has not submitted all of the facts of
experiments to the FDA, retaining unto itself the
unpermitted option of filtering, interpreting, and not
submitting information which we would consider material
to the safety evaluation of the product. Some of our findings
suggest an attitude of disregard for the FDA s mission of
protection of the public health by selectively reporting the
results of studies in a manner which allays the concerns and
questions of an FDA reviewer."

Dr. John Olney of Washington University in St. Louis, a noted
neuropathologist and psychiatrist, said, "animal studies were
done showing a very high incidence of brain tumors in rats that
had been fed aspartame in a two year feeding period." The
doctor and his colleagues suspect aspartame to be implicated
with brain tumors because the type of CNS (central nervous
system) tumors found to be increasing most rapidly in the USA
is the same kind of tumor found in the animal studies conducted
on aspartame in the 1970 s. However, Dr. Philip Lavin of the
Harvard Medical School said, "The increase in brain tumor
incidence started well before aspartame marketing and sales"
and Dr. Robert Moser, a medical consultant with
NutraSweet said, "aspartame cannot cause a tumor
because it does not reach organs intact". Yet, according
to the Conference of the American College of Physicians,
"we are talking about a plague of neurological diseases
caused by this deadly poison".

Aspartame is a molecule composed of three chemicals,
aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. Once ingested,
the methanol (wood alcohol that has killed or blinded
thousands of skid row drunks) encounters the enzyme
chymotrypsin, converts to formaldehyde, then formic
acid (ant sting poison). Formaldehyde (embalming fluid)
is a deadly neurotoxin (substance that attacks nerve cells)
which is grouped in the same class of deadly poisons
such as cyanide and arsenic. Aspartic acid and phenylalanine
are both amino acids (building blocks for proteins)
nevertheless, when taken in their free form unbound to
proteins and unaccompanied by other amino acids we use,
they also become neurotoxins.

Neurosurgeon, Dr. Russell Blaylock said, "the ingredients
stimulate the neurons of the brain to death causing brain
damage of varying degrees." Dr. H. J. Roberts, said,
"consuming aspartame at the time of conception can cause
birth defects". As per Dr. Louis Elsas, pediatrician
professor  of genetics at Emory University, "The
phenylalanine concentrates in the placenta causing mental
retardation". Dr. James Bowen says fetal tissue cannot
tolerate methanol or phenylalanine. He calls NutraSweet
"instant birth control".

According to the NSDA (National Soft Drink Association),
at 86 degrees Fahrenheit aspartame breakdown gets into
high gear. The NSDA wanted aspartame outlawed from
soft drinks. They drafted protest printed in the
Congressional Record of May 7, 1985, describing
aspartames instability. Many believe that aspartame
accounts for over 75% of the adverse reactions to food
additives reported to the FDA since 1982. These reports
detail well over 10,000 complaints of 92 different symptoms.
Numerous researchers and physicians have noted that it is
often difficult for a consumer to link adverse reactions to
aspartame because it tends to mimic or intensify various
illnesses, such as, epilepsy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis,
Alzheimer s, Parkinson s and many more.

For over eight years the FDA refused to approve aspartame
because of the seizures and brain tumors this drug produced
in lab animals. When the safety of aspartame was considered
by a Public Board of Inquiry (PBI) in 1980, it recommended
that further studies be conducted to clarify the issue before
aspartame could be considered acceptably safe for use. Both
the PBI and the FDA staff scientists were, however,
over-ruled by the incoming of FDA Commissioner, Arthur
Hull Hayes, Jr. who asserted that the brain cancer risk was
minimal and that further research was not necessary and
approved the use of aspartame in dry foods. In 1983
Commissioner Hayes, Jr. approved the use of aspartame in
carbonated beverages then shortly after left the FDA for a
position with G.D. Searle s Public Relations firm. On June 27,
1996, the FDA approved the use of aspartame as a "general
purpose sweetener" meaning that aspartame can now be used
in any food or beverage where standards of identity do not
preclude its use.

Despite many allegations that aspartame may be hazardous,
there are still a number of organizations that believe that
aspartame is safe for human consumption. These being, the
FDA, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control), the American
Medical Association s Council on Scientific Affairs, Joint
Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and many
more. For this reason, many researchers and scientists say
that aspartame should undergo another two-year study
conducted by a group of scientists not employed by the makers
of aspartame in order to properly evaluate the artificial
sweetener for human consumption.

Section 2   News Release from
The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)


The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) commends the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on its approval
of ActonelÒ (risedronate), a new therapy for the prevention
and treatment of osteoporosis.

Sandra C. Raymond, NOF executive director, in commenting
on the approval said, "With approval of ActonelÒ women now
have another choice of therapy for this disabling disease. 
This therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis 
and its associated fractures will help at risk women remain
active, strong and independent throughout their lives.
This can only happen if women past menopause talk to
their physicians to evaluate their bone health and, if
appropriate, take action."

"Osteoporosis is a ‘silent’ risk factor for bone fractures
of the hip, spine, and wrist and other bones, just as
 hypertension is for stroke. Prevention, detection and
treatment of osteoporosis should be a mandate of
primary care, and a routine part of physicals", says
NOF president, C. Conrad Johnston Jr., M.D. "Bone
density tests are now widely available and should be
offered to high risk women to detect low bone density
before their bones weaken and fractures occur." Some
risk factors include being female, being menopausal or
postmenopausal, having a family history of osteoporosis,
a personal history of fractures as an adult, a thin or 
small build, an inactive lifestyle, and low calcium 
intake. ActonelÒ also is approved for the prevention 
and treatment of the bone loss caused by corticosteroids, 
the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis. 

"Osteoporosis is a serious and common complication of 
prolonged corticosteroid therapy for men and women at 
any age," says Johnston. "Bone loss increases with the 
dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment. Anyone 
about to go on long-term corticosteroids at doses
equivalent to 7.5 mg of prednisone or more, or anyone who
has been on them chronically, should have a bone density
test. This new treatment provides doctors with another
therapy to offer their patients who must take corticosteroids."

Osteoporosis -- a disease that gradually weakens bones and
often leads to painful and debilitating fractures -- is a 
major public health threat for more than 28 million Americans,
80 percent of whom are women. Vertebral fractures lead to
stooped posture, loss of height, chronic pain and disability,
and cause compression of the lungs and stomach. Hip
fractures are not only disabling, but can be life-threatening.
Twenty percent of people die in the year following a hip
fracture. This disease causes nearly 1.5 million fractures
annually and costs this country nearly $14 billion each year.
With more than 250,000 members, the National Osteoporosis
Foundation is the only nonprofit, voluntary health organization
dedicated to reducing the widespread prevalence of
osteoporosis through programs of research, education,
and advocacy.

Section 3. Talk to Garlic
====================================

Dear Garlic

Help!!!!
my darling husband LOVES to renovate
but everything he touches falls apart!
I have doors hanging off hinges and
wobbly cabinets, that I can overlook,
BUT when he comes to bed full of sawdust
I get turned off, it's ruining our love life,
what shall I do?

signed "Dusty"

*******

Dear Dusty
This is a classic in the Geraldines’  Handymans  Journal.
What do you do with sawdust anywhere?  Heh-heh-heh,
you  VACUUM it up! Everytime your adorable hubby
comes to bed covered in sawdust, get out the old Eurika
and let-er-rip.  Vacuums are really quite handy and please
don’t forget to use all the interesting attachments to get
into the crevasses.  After you do this a few times, two
things can happen. No more sawdust in the bed
(he’ll start to take a shower before bedtime),
or even better - an exciting new twist to your lovemaking!
