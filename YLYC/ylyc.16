Section 2           TESTIMONIES FOR SUCCESS 

Dear Your Life-Your Choice, 

I am a firm believer in the use of herbs. I've 
been using Yucca for my Arthritis, and it has 
helped the pain in my knees tremendously! 

Linda-Rae
Alberta

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Two years ago I developed eczema on my arm. As time went by 
it progressed to almost covering my arm. I went to the doctor 
and he said that I had a chronic case of Dermatitis, and 
would have to see a specialist, who would probably put me on 
high doses of Prednisone and maybe even want to take a biopsy. 
This scared me a lot. I started to read my herb books and make 
phone calls as to what I should take. I started to take 
Dandelion and Red Clover right away. By the time I went to 
the specialist it was 70% improved. He told me to apply 
Dermovate, twice a day for 3 weeks and said only to come back 
to him if it didn't clear. Well, I have only used Dermovate 
5 times, and it has cleared up. I know that it was the herbs 
cleansing my blood and liver that caused this.

----------

	Okay, so you've decided that you're tired of taking 
toxic medicines and dealing with the side effects that 
come with them. You've made a decision to take some 
preventative measures for your health. The questions is… 
Where do you begin? With so many modalities at hand, which 
alternative therapy is the most effective? Which one is 
right for YOU?

	Consider this series of articles a resource to be 
used as a starting ground. We will cover most of the 
commonly recognized modalities and briefly describe what 
they are all about. Remember, this is a brief description. 
Often we will not be able to do justice to the therapy in 
question in such a limited amount of space. However it 
should give you enough information to decide if you're 
interested in pursing it further. This resource is meant 
to educate you as to the numerous options available. YOU 
are the one who is empowered to take control over your 
health on a going forward basis.


ACUPRESSURE - Acupressure is based on the same concept 
as Acupuncture. In this treatment, however, stimulation 
is administered through strategically applied pressure 
with the thumbs or fingers instead of needles. Often this 
is done in conjunction with a Shiatsu Massage. A benefit 
of this treatment is that you can learn to properly 
perform this technique on yourself. 

ACUPUNCTURE - Acupuncture has been practised in China for 
over 4,500 years. It is believed that an energy flow 
travels through our body using pathways called meridians. 
This energy is referred to as our "Chi". Illness is said 
to occur when a blockage in the meridian stops the Chi from 
passing through and an imbalance of energy flow transpires. 
The practitioner evaluates the situation and strategically 
inserts thin needles into the skin to stimulate these 
points, clearing up the blockage, and restoring balance. 
Consequently, restoring health. Recently some scientists 
have suggested that the acupuncturists's needles may 
stimulate the body's endorphins (naturally occurring 
painkillers). Thus allowing the body to heal itself. This 
treatment is used for various common health issues such as 
building Immune Systems, Epstein-barr, Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome, Depression , Alleviating Pain, Addiction 
Recovery, and many more related ailments.

ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE - This technique was discovered by 
Australian born Physiotherapist, Fredrich Alexander. He 
believed that through our fast paced, stressful 
environments and the people we have surrounded ourselves 
with, we have unconsciously developed poor structural 
(postural) habits. This, in turn, has resulted in health 
issues that need to be addressed. This technique teaches 
an awareness of the skeletal structure and how to best 
promote optimal health by maintaining appropriate postures 
and specific body movements. The Alexander Technique has 
been known to be effective for addressing Digestive 
Problems, Depression, Arthritis, Anxiety, and similar 
health concerns.

AROMATHERAPY - Every plant has an Essential Oil which 
contains both medicinal and aromatic properties. When 
properly extracted from the plant, these Oils can have 
tremendous healing properties. Essential Oils are easily 
absorbed through the skin. As such their efficacy is 
enhanced when used in Baths or during Massages. Fragrances 
can be dispersed into the air using a diffuser for the 
purpose of inhaling. Specific Oils have been known to be 
particularly effective in addressing certain health issues. 
It is not uncommon to see Aromatherapy used in conjunction 
with other modalities such as Acupressure, Massage, 
Psychotherapy, etc. Aromatherapy has been helpful in many 
common health issues including colds, controlling mood 
swings, dealing with stress, increasing mental alertness, 
and much more.

AURA HEALING - It is said that every living thing emanates 
a sphere of coloured light which encompasses it. This sphere 
is referred to as an Aura. Evidence of illness can be seen 
within the Aura and often appears as a darker area. This 
therapy is closely integrated with Chakra. Only a trained 
healer is able to diagnose through visual perception of 
the Aura. Often Masters of modalities such as Reiki and 
Chakra have integrated this into their healing techniques. 

AYURVEDIC HEALING - This is a Hindu system of medicine 
practised originating in India and parts of the Far East. 
This treatment is based on the idea of balance between your 
body specific body type and the elements; air, earth, fire 
and water. Typically when resolving health issues, emphasis 
is placed on diet, herbal treatments, and yoga breathing.


As we have exhausted our space limitation for this issue, 
we will continue exploring Alternative/Complementary 
Therapies in upcoming issues. Just a reminder that this 
is for educational purposes only, and Your Life-Your Choice 
does not endorse any specific modality. As always we 
encourage you to consult your doctor and/or a certified 
practitioner in your area.

Section 5   	Travel: This Vacation, Be Prepared 
			With Natural Remedies 

              By Tracy L. Pipp / The Detroit News 
			http://detnews.com/


For your vacation this year, remember to pack all the 
necessities: clothing, shampoo, camera -- and a natural 
first-aid kit. 

The last item is the suggestion of leading natural healing 
expert Dr. Andrew Weil. He details what he takes on his 
travels in the current issue of his newsletter, Self Healing: 
           
* Vitamins and supplements. Travel stress can wear
  down immunity, making it even more essential to keep up
  with your regular program. 
* Echinacea. Stale airplane air invites coughs and colds;
  Take this immune-boosting herb at the first sign of a
  scratchy throat. It also can be used as a preventative by 
  starting the regimen a day or two before you depart. 
* Zinc lozenges. For coughs, colds, congestion or a sore
  throat. 
* Melatonin. This hormone, which regulates sleep/wake
  cycles, is an excellent remedy for jet lag. 
* Valerian. A nonaddictive and natural sleep aid. 
* Ginger. Ginger can calm queasiness and ease indigestion. 
  Try eating slices of it candied or taking two to four 
  capsules of the powdered spice. 
* Acidophilus. This antidiarrhea agent is a culture of the
  friendly bacteria found in sour milk. Take it with 
  meals in places where diarrhea is a threat.

6.		Back to School Aromatherapy.

I first came in contact with the essential oils perhaps 15 
years ago. Their healing power awed and fascinated me from 
the start. Several years of study and experimentation with 
the essential oils followed. The founding of Nature's Gift 
Custom Aromatherapy Products followed. I am really delighted 
that the internet gives me a venue to learn from others, and 
to share what I've learned.

----- 

Back to school time in my family always triggered a round 
of new coughs and colds, as the children, especially the 
youngest, were exposed to germs from other neighborhoods.  
I wish when my children were school aged I had known about 
the wonders of aromatherapy, of the anti-bacterial and 
antiviral properties of some of the most common oils.

Some suggestions for beating the 'back to school' nasties 
in your house this Autumn.

One of the strongest antiviral and antibacterial Essential 
Oils is good old Lemon Oil (Citrus limon), cold pressed from 
the rind of the lemons. Don't buy the little 1/2 ounce 
bottle at your local health food store; you will often find 
Lemon Oil in bulk from many online suppliers. I don't 
recommend using lemon in 'skin blends' for massage, etc., 
but add a teaspoon or so of it to the washing machine (shake 
it up in a cup or so of water, first, and then pour it in) 
or pour a few drops on a cotton wash cloth and add it to the 
drier. Not only does it do a job on the nasties, but it 
leaves your clothes smelling 'cleaner than clean.' A few 
drops added to the dishpan while washing dishes, and added 
to the pan of water you wipe down countertops, floors, etc. 
will leave your kitchen germ free. I use lemon oil and water 
in a glass atomizer bottle for cleaning mirrors, the telephone 
receiver, around the bathroom sink, etc. Add a few drops to a
dishpan, or about a half teaspoon to a bucket of water. I do 
not recommend adding it to the dishwasher, since I'm not sure 
what effect it will have on plastic or rubber parts.

Another great germ killer is Tea Tree Oil, Melaleuca 
alternifolia, from Australia, or Manuka, Leptospermum 
scoparium from New Zealand. Different essential oils, 
the same effect on germs, viruses, molds and spores. I
prefer the Manuka because it has a slightly softer, less 
medicinal smell, but that is a matter of personal taste. 
Again, add to the water when cleaning up, or even add 
about four or five drops to a bath when you suspect 
someone might be coming down with a cold. (Make sure to 
stir the water thoroughly when adding EO's to a bath, 
since they don't disperse in the water.)

When it comes to homework time, sometimes even the most 
eager student has trouble settling down and concentrating.  
Research in Japan indicates that lemon oil dispersed in 
the air leads to better focus, fewer errors and heightened 
ability to concentrate.  Again, the spray bottle with a little
Lemon EO shaken in with water will do for an inexpensive room 
scenter. (Avoid spraying this on your antique wooden chair, 
the Essential Oil can do bad things to wood finishes.)

Another problem that seems epidemic nationwide is head lice.  
It happens to all of us, the nicest children from the nicest 
families in the nicest schools. There is anecdotal evidence 
that a shampoo with lavender, peppermint and tea tree 
essential oils added MAY help prevent an infestation. 
Adding a TOTAL of 10 drops of each essential oil per two
ounces of shampoo, and rinsing the hair with a vinegar/water 
rinse with five or six drops of the essential oil blend added 
to the rinse. If your child does bring home the dreaded note 
that lice have been found, a researcher on one of the 
Aromatherapy mailing lists has shared the following:

Shampoos are generally ineffective at killing lice and their 
eggs since they don't stay in contact long enough to be 
effective. It is better to use a base of 40% alcohol (vodka 
would do), 60% water and add EOs to that at a rate of 10 
drops to 2 ounces of the water/alcohol mix. Rub that into 
the scalp and leave on overnight then shampoo off in the 
morning. Then put a rinse through the hair using 2 mls of 
the same EO/ EO mix that you used originally added to half 
a pint of 50:50 vinegar and water. Repeat the whole process 
a week later. As to EOs to use, tea tree would work fairly
well but I would combine it with eucalyptus.  In working 
with small children, I prefer to use Eucalyptus Smithii, a 
gentler chemotype that is less apt to be irritating.  

If at all possible, I would rather try the above mixture, 
rather than the chemical shampoos that are sold for killing 
lice.  One still has to take a fine toothed comb to the nits, 
but the procedure above is generally effective.

Please be very careful about storing your Essential Oils if 
you have small children; many of them are toxic at very low 
doses if taken internally.
