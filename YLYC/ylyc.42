Wellness - or, simply put, good health - is not necessarily 
the result of what you put into your mouth. The extensive 
research of Joel M. Teutsch and Champion K. Teutsch has shown 
the real cause of sickness or other conditions:

an adverse mind factor and unfavorable genetic predisposition. 
They have learned to modify them for their clients' benefit. 
This does not invalidate the use of diet, vitamins and medication. 
It merely enhances their potent affects on the consumer. 

We feel everyone has a perfect right to the same quick and 
lasting results as their many satisfied clients.

                 Letter from the Editor

	Well, the holidays are upon us! This is the time
of year where virtually every country has a celebration 
of some sort. It's a time to open your heart to others. It's 
a time for loving and giving. It's an opportunity to offer 
kindness and compassion to those less fortunate. Those 
"less fortunate" may be homeless and hungry. But they 
may also be lonely and angry. They may have just lost 
a loved one or they may be too ill to enjoy or be a part 
of this wonderful season. 

	As you go about your business in the next few 
weeks, remember that it is not possible to overdose on 
smiles, hugs, and kind words and deeds. Don't be afraid 
that the person behind you in a checkout (or the checkout 
person themselves) has received too many smiles and 
words of encouragement. There's always room for more 
of these.  And the terrific thing is that the more you give, 
the better YOU feel too!
       
        Let me take just a minute to remind you to visit
http://www.markteche.com/freepolls/synesael.htm and 
fill in a very short survey. You contact information is 
always kept in the strictest of confidence. We want to 
learn a little more about you so we can determine the 
kinds of products and services that will benefit you the 
most. It shouldn't take you more than 30 seconds. 

       To thank you for completing the survey you will 
receive a FREE gift. After you submit the results of 
your survey, visit http://www.Life-Choices.com/freegift.html
to see what special treat awaits you. My deepest thanks 
to the VERY talented Michele Johnson from Petals of Life 
(http://www.petalsoflife.com) for allowing me to offer 
this gift to you.

        Your Life-Your Choice sends you all big smiles and 
hugs along with our wishes that all of you have 
the very safest, happiest and healthiest of holidays!

Impotence affects more than 30 million men nationwide.  This 
health condition is believed to be grossly under diagnosed 
because of the embarrassment of patients, and their reluctance 
to discuss sexual matters candidly.  Although for some men 
erectile function may not be the best or even the most important 
part of sexual satisfaction, for many men a dysfunction in this area 
creates mental stress that affects their interactions with both family 
and associates.  It should also be noted that desire, orgasmic 
capability, and ejaculatory capacity may be intact even in the 
presence of erectile dysfunction or may be deficient to some extent 
and contribute to the sense of inadequate sexual function.

Impotence is often assumed to be a natural part of the aging process, 
to be tolerated with little hope of recovery.  This assumption is not be 
entirely correct. Both for the elderly and for others, impotence may 
occur as a consequence of specific illnesses or of medical treatment 
for certain illnesses, resulting in fear, loss of self-confidence, and 
depression.  More serious diseases such as Diabetes or Cardiovascular 
Disease could be responsible for erectly dysfunction.  Other factors 
such as smoking, drinking, some prescription medications, surgery, 
stress and depression may also contribute to impotence. 

Because of the reluctance of both patients and doctors to address this 
issue, many are unaware of the variety of treatments available and 
consequently the dysfunction remains untreated, and the psychological 
impact deepens.

Nearly 95% of the time impotence is treatable even with traditional 
or Western Medicine.  Most men regain their ability to have intercourse 
using one or more of the treatment options available. The very best 
thing a person can do is to accept impotence for what it is...  a treatable 
condition, like heart disease or diabetes. 

If you suffer from chronic impotency, you should see a doctor to 
determine if there is another health issue involved.  However, if 
your problem is only occasional, there are some herbs that may 
help.  Those wishing a "natural" approach for this situation should 
investigate the bark of the yohimbe tree.  This has been used as a 
treatment for impotency in Africa for centuries.  There is a drug 
called yohimbine which is an extract of this herb and is recognized 
as a legitimate treatment for impotency in the United States.  The 
drug, however, can be potentially toxic and should only be used 
under the supervision of a qualified physician.  Damiana has a 
reputation as a tonic for the sexual organs and is generally safe to 
take on a daily basis.  Schizandra is a Chinese herb which is also 
accredited to enhance male sexual performance and is safe for 
long-term use.  Although these are recognized as "safe" herbs, 
you are ALWAYS advised to consult a qualified health care 
provider before pursuing any treatment.

----------      
   Christmas can be a wonderful time of beautiful sights, sounds 
and aromas.  Often, in our stressful environment, it is rather 
difficult to take some time to reflect and appreciate this magical 
season.  Perhaps this would be a good time to focus on the two 
ancient and traditional scents of Christmas - Frankincense and 
Myrrh.  Both of these oils remind us of the precious gifts of the 
Wise Men - certainly gifts that would be appropriate for a new-born 
King.

    Frankincense was burned as an incense by ancient Egyptians 
and the charred resin was ground into a powder used as a distinctive 
black eyeliner.  They also used myrrh resin in the embalming 
process, thus the association with death and tombs.  The aromas from 
both of these oils promote deep meditative states and connect us to 
ancient rituals and societies.

    Many different species of frankincense and myrrh grow from East 
Africa through southern Arabia and into north-western India.  The 
trunks of both trees exude a sticky resin which contains about 4% 
essential oils.  The resin, dried in the hot sun, forms hard knobs called 
"tears".  Myrrh tears symbolize suffering and Frankincense symbolizes 
divinity.  Steam distilled essential oils of both of these trees are used in 
aromatherapy.

    Aromatherapy uses of frankincense and myrrh compliment their 
deeply meditative qualities.  A gentle diffusion of a blend of equal 
proportions of both oils can promote emotional balance during times 
of anxiety and stress.  If one is seeking a more inspiring and less 
introverting effect, both these oils can be blended with citrus oils.  
Lemon and bergamot combine well with frankincense, orange and 
tangerine with myrrh.  However, if you want to experience the 
mysterious atmosphere of ancient civilizations, burn the crude resin 
on hot coals and become "one with the past".

    Christmas scents must also include the wonderful, refreshing smell 
of pine.  So many folks today depend on the fake pine tree that folds 
up in the box and returns to the cupboard year after year.  Whatever 
the reason for the "fake pine", saving natural trees or avoiding fire 
hazards, the scent of fresh pine is essential.  Here is an excellent 
opportunity to achieve the aroma of the northern forests, 
essential pine oil.  Not only will the pine scent contribute to the festive 
mood, inhalations of pine are good for colds, catarrh, sinusitis and 
sore throats. In the bath pine needs to be mixed with a carrier in order 
to prevent skin irritation.  It is refreshing, deodorizing, stimulating and 
relieves muscular pain.  A massage oil needs to be blended, used in 
small proportions and well-diluted to avoid irritation.

    There is still one more scent to consider.  Everyone is familiar with 
the custom of kissing under the mistletoe.  To add more zest to that kiss, 
add a drop of Patchouli oil to the mistletoe before hanging it in the 
doorway.  This oil is known for its sensual and amorous effects.      

    Have a merry and scentful Yule!  P.S. Remember that "aromatherapy 
gifts" are very popular and appreciated.  The home spa has become a 
place to both relax and rejuvenate into this busy world.

I was in the grocery store the other day and there was a woman
at the check out stand beside mine. She wore dirty clothes, 
needed her hair washed and had a cigarette hanging out of her
mouth. All of a sudden she turned in my direction and I saw her
face.

I almost started to cry. Her face was the most frightful 
face I have ever seen. Years of bitterness and resentment
were written there; years of anger and hurt, years of being
unloved and uncared for.

And, out of her mouth were words of anger as she spoke 
to her small child. She must have been in her thirties, but
she looked like she was over fifty. The hatred had done
its job. The bitterness had robbed this woman of her youth.

She chose what she was going to be.

Attitude has a powerful impact on our physical bodies. 
The thoughts we have held and the words we have used
have created the person we are right now. So, it only
stands to reason, if we change our thoughts and words,
we can be transformed into an entirely different person.
(And, some of us need some transformation : )

It doesn't matter how long we have held on to anger,
lack of forgiveness, self-hatred, pity, resentment, 
ungratefulness, etc., etc. We can change our thought
patterns.

We are what we choose to be.

When someone hurts us, we react and we don't forgive. 
We hold on the hurt. Poor me...nobody really understands.
Nobody really cares.

We are choosing what we are to become.

I have a friend (she is 35 years old) who's mother 
died of breast cancer. My friend constantly worried 
and fretted about developing the disease herself. 
 
She went in for check-ups twice a year...sometimes more. 
She constantly talked about it. Was always reading up 
on it. What causes it? What cures it? 

I finally told her, "You are going to get this disease for no
other reason than your obsession with it."

This friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a few weeks ago.

We go where our thoughts take us.

I remember one client who had been on thyroid medication
for almost 20 years. She was a willing converter...something
I don't see a lot of : )

She changed her diet completely, exercised everyday, spent
time each afternoon receiving the healing benefits of sunshine.
She juiced, she supplemented....she did everything right as far
as diet and lifestyle change. Did it help? No.

Finally I had a talk with her about the emotions behind thyroid
problems - long standing anger. Her response was, "How did
you know?"

This client was carrying around 20 years worth of anger and
bitterness towards her deceased mother. She had been abused
as a child and never felt love from the woman who gave her birth.

When she realized this, she could begin steps towards forgiving.
Her mother wasn't being hurt by her emotions, she was. As she
forgave, the healing began.

We are what we choose to be.

Choose to be happy. Choose not to let the cares of this world
bring us down. Choose to do something nice for someone today.
Tell your child how special he is. Tell him to live his dreams, 
accomplish his goals. Thank God everyday for your many
blessing!

Don't live a life of negatives when you can enjoy a life of 
positives. Always see the glass half full, not empty. And,
remember, "We are what we choose to be".
(c) 1999
