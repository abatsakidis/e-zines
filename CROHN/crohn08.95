       This Issue: Candida Albicans - Anemia - Book Reviews

====================================================================== 

       WELCOME to the first edition of "The Olde Crohn", an electronic
magazine written by former Crohn's and Colitis sufferers who have taken
back their health and have begun new and productive lives.  Published
online every other month, we will devote each issue to a detailed
discussion of a specific topic from the causes and effects of
inflammatory bowel disease.
       Over the years I have come to know many people like myself, who
have been diagnosed with Crohn's.  And through those years I have
suffered from my "affliction" along with them.  However, it always
seemed that there were a few lucky individuals who showed little or no
symptoms and were leading happy and productive lives.
       As a scientist and researcher I was intrigued, and as a Crohn's
sufferer I knew I had to find the answer. What I was hoping to find was
some "miracle" cure, some magic bullet.  Some simple thing that I could
do, or eat, or take, that would make my pain go away.  I was to be
disappointed.
       What I have come to learn is that while there is not one global
answer that fits everyone, there is an individual group of answers that
will work for each and every one of us.  There are solutions to our pain
and suffering. 
       If you are looking for an easy answer or a single pill solution
like I was, don't bother to read "The Olde Crohn".  The simple, no
investment answer is simply not here.
       However, if you are willing to work hard at conquering your
disease, if you are willing to experiment, if you are relentless in your
desire to be healthy, if you are dedicated to taking back your health
from an "incurable disease", then you may find your answers here.
       In the pages of "The Olde Crohn", thanks to the volunteer
assistance of Novus Research, you will find technical reports that we
have discovered both from traditional medicine and from alternative
sources.  You will find nutritional information, drug descriptions along
with their success and failure rates, and new therapies that are showing
promise from around the world.
       But of the highest importance, you will find the personal stories
of people who have conquered Crohn's Disease and Colitis.  People like
you and me, who have suffered for years, but who have refused to submit
to the label "incurable", and have persevered and succeeded.
       The most well known Latin phrase comes from Julius Caesar who said
"Veni, Vidi, Vici" ( "I came, I saw, I conquered")  The word "vidi" not
only means "to see" but to "understand or know". The people who have
conquered Crohn's and Colitis have a basic, pervasive similarity.  First
and foremost, they came to "know and understand" their enemy, and as a
result they came to conquer it.
       If you are willing to come to that place of understanding, that
place of knowing, you too can and will conquer the "incurable".  It is
the mission of those of us involved in "The Olde Crohn" to assist you to
know and understand.  We plan to motivate, educate, elucidate, and teach
anyone with the desire, anyone with the vision, who wants to defeat
Crohn's and Colitis. 
       The mythical old crone, the ancient woman who was charged with the
preservation of the knowledge of her tribe, is the model of our format. 
In ancient times, seekers of knowledge went to the elders, who taught
through stories of their ancestors, and solved problems from knowledge
gleaned from those revelations.  This "Olde Crohn" will be no different.
       To that end we will publish "The Olde Crohn" every other month [the
even numbered ones].  We are presently looking for a permanent archive
site for "The Olde Crohn" and we will post the location through
alt.support.crohns-colitis once we have it locked down. If anyone has
any suggestions, let us know via Email. Feel free to copy "The Olde
Crohn" and distribute it to anyone. We will also make the hard copy
edition available by subscription to anyone without online access.  
       In the spirit of our common cause we welcome and encourage debate,
informed disagreement, your own comments, stories and perspectives. We
will publish those that can be of value to our readers.  We also solicit
articles from those of you who have valuable information and
perspectives to pass on to the rest of us.
       If you have a question about anything you read in "The Olde Crohn"
or a question specific to your disease, and you take the effort to Email
to us; we will make the effort to respond to you.
       Between issues we strongly suggest that you continue to subscribe
to the alt.support.crohns-colitis newsgroup, and continue to support it
by your postings and comments.
       In the meantime, we will be out there lurking, searching and
surfing, hoping to find the good stuff.

========================================================================

       My name is Mike Harris and I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in
1975.  I was twenty-one years old, in my first year of a promising
career in law enforcement, and beginning a master's degree program in
psychology at the University of Bridgeport [Connecticut].
       Since my mid teens I seemed to have some predilection to catching
the flu.  Just thinking about it seemed to bring on the aches, diarrhea,
and high fevers.  But being young and hearty, I refused to let it
interrupt my work, education or social life.  I simply pushed on past
it.
       But by the time I hit 21 the flu bouts were becoming longer and
nastier.  I was regularly missing several days in a row of classes and
it was becoming a struggle to keep up.  My supervisor at work began
calling me aside about the number of sick days I was taking.  The
pressure to keep up with class work and perform at a physically
demanding job blew my social life out the door.  A two year-old
relationship also went down the tubes.  Slowly, but irreversibly my well
ordered world was unraveling.  And as it unraveled, the pressures on me
to perform increased.
       Final exams hit like Hiroshima.  My work schedule got bumped from
the 4:00 PM shift to the midnight shift because my supervisor "couldn't
rely on me."  In the flurry of activity I forgot to deposit a paycheck
and my utility bills bounced like superballs.  I came home one rainy
morning at 7 AM from a particularly bad night shift where I had been
reprimanded for studying for a statistics final while on duty, to find
no light, no phone.  My gut was on fire. I was convinced that I was
getting an ulcer, a big one.  I went inside to my personal mess, pushed
an empty pizza box off the couch and collapsed.
       That's were a co-worker found me two days later.  I had blown my
work schedule, missed two finals, and was lying on a sweat soaked
blanket with a blast furnace of a fever.  He managed to get me into some
clean clothes (where he found them, I have no idea) and drove me to the
hospital.
       The nurse at the ER gave me a strange look as she touched my
forehead.  The look she gave the thermometer was even stranger.  She
pressed the intercom by my gurney and said "Stat 14", and I said to
myself "I'm a gonna die."  I managed to crack a smile and grinned, "must
be a new record..".  "Sir, a 104 degree fever is nothing to joke about. 
She was right, I am a gonna die for sure.
       Lots of tubes, probes, needles, a gallon or two of barium "it
tastes just like a milkshake" goop applied from both ends and the
diagnosis was in.  My family doctor, the same man who had seen me down
the birth canal, delivered the news. "You have TERMINAL ileitis."
       I didn't give a hoot about the ileitis part, it was the "T" word
that got my attention.  However, I was quickly reassured that it
referred to a place, not an event and that I was not "a gonna die for
sure."  All that was needed was some "simple" surgery.  Simple in that
you snip out the bad section of bowel and sew the severed ends back
together.  I wanted a second opinion about the terminal stuff.
       It was at this juncture that my ultimate fortune, if not my
immediate comfort took a turn for the better.  My family doctor, not
being familiar with terminal ileitis, aka regional enteritis, had called
in a specialist.  He was fresh out of gastroenterology residency and was
"up on all of the new research and therapy" on my problem.
       "No", he said as he prodded my tender and inflamed innards, "we
don't rush to section the bowel anymore, since in most cases the
inflammation just comes back, only in a more aggressive manner."  The
translation was simply "cuttin' does nothin'."
       It would be this one piece of medical advice that would save me
from even greater horrors and afflictions.  I am convinced today that
had I undergone surgery, my final recovery would not have been as
successful.

ENTER PREDNISONE

       Prednisone.  My constant companion, friend, best buddy, lover. 
With you in my life, I functioned flawlessly.  With you in my life, I
worked at maximum potential, got promoted to CO II at work, I made
dean's list, I graduated with an M.S. in Psych and I was dating two,
(count them, two) great ladies.  Without you in my life, my insides
burned, my fever soared, and my anus glowed red hot.
       Prednisone. My colleague, my support, my energy.  With you in my
life, I had no worries, no cares, no pain. With you in my life I felt
euphoric.  I just don't know what they mean when they say ileitis is
"incurable".  So what, who cares.  With prednisone there is no ileitis.
       Ah Prednisone, how fickle you were.  I loved you so completely and
needed you so desperately.  Why, how could you abandon me like that.
       The first signs that I was being played the fool by my lover were
physical.  But I didn't care.  So what if my upper body strength was
draining away and my muscle mass was disappearing.  So what if my  
face was a little rounded.  I really didn't mind the mood swings, and
the embarrassing bursts of anger although my friends seemed to take
exception to them.
       I could put up with all of it, I could give myself to you
completely.  Just stay and keep the burning from my insides at bay and
I'll put up with anything else you do to me.
       But the doctors said no way.  The affair needed to come to an end,
gradually, but to an end.  They assured me that there would be other
lovers.
       But I was not to have them.  Azulfadine and all of her sorority
sisters made me sick, and they did nothing for the burning.  I rebelled
from all of the other prescription drugs, I refused to follow diets,
Pepto Bismol gave me a dark tongue and wicked black stools, and
Kaopectate made me retch.  I wanted my Prednisone, no substitutes, just
prednisone.
        The doctors finally relented.  But now they would try a new
approach.  If prednisone was bad for me every day, even in moderate
doses, perhaps taking a dose every other day would be less damaging.  I
didn't care, I got prednisone.  Prednisone.  No burning in my guts, no
long sessions on the commode, no fevers.  Muscle wasting, mild
psychological disturbance, brittle bones, potential retinal clouding,
but no burning in my guts.  I was happy.

THE FIRST REVELATION

       The career in law enforcement just didn't work out.  I was rapidly
losing the physical prowess thanks to my love affair with prednisone and
I saw the writing on the wall.  Get out now vertically or get out later
horizontally.  I quit and went back to school.  My undergraduate degree
was in engineering so I got myself into an advanced degree program in
mechanical engineering.  After graduating, I went to work for an
engineering group that designed mass transit systems.  A great job, lots
of international travel, and a sense of accomplishment at the end of a
project.  Yes, yes, I was a skinny, round faced, moody bastard most of
the time, but I felt great.
       I was working on a project in Cairo, Egypt and had the great
fortune to have lunch with a professor of internal medicine at Cairo
University.  Somehow, he got the impression that I was taking
corticosteroid (how I don't know :-]) and began to question me at
length.  We talked about the drug, its prescription alternatives, and
Crohn's.  His response to prednisone was standard medical profession,
his statement about Crohn's floored me.  
       He leaned across the table and said, " I don't believe that there
is such a malady as Crohn's disease."  After I dusted my self off, he
then elaborated.  Let me paraphrase for you.
       Crohn's disease, according to the good doctor, was a "catch all"
for any unexplainable inflammation of the bowel.  Once a root cause
appeared from testing, then a "treatable" diagnosis was given. If a root
cause was not discerned, then the label "enteritis" aka Crohn's disease
is applied.  Discovery of a localization of the inflammation will result
in a more precise sounding diagnosis such as ileitis (involved ilium or
ileocecal valve) or Colitis (involvement of the lower colon).  However,
the end diagnosis is still merely an acknowledgement that there is
inflammation at a particular site.  There is no diagnosis of the root
cause.  Thus the disease is referred to as being "incurable".  As a
result, the physician must treat the disease symptomatically. 
Prednisone treats the inflammation, not the cause of the inflammation.
Once the "catch-all" diagnosis has been reached, physicians tend to be
satisfied with successful symptom suppression, not aggressive, curative
action. It's quite simple, he concluded ,"you read the barium x-ray, you
find inflammation, you identify the region, you give it the assigned
name, and then you direct your energy at suppressing the symptoms so
your patient can function." 
       "Hmmm", I thought.

THE SECOND REVELATION

       The concept of being functionally undiagnosed was quite disturbing. 
It was difficult to fathom that after years of physical and
psychological deterioration, I had merely been "suppressing symptoms"
and that no real attempt had been made to relieve my affliction.  After
a quick reality check with several physicians, I confirmed that they
could not nor would not dispute the theory.  I was left with the
following irrefutable facts:

FACT 1: The last twenty years of treatment, including my on again, off
again affair with prednisone, had been directed solely at symptom
suppression.

FACT 2: No real effort had been directed at finding out why "I" had
inflammation.  Sure, there is research into Crohn's in general, but the
causes might be broad based and individualized, not from a single
focused causative agent.  Besides, I didn't care about anyone else's
inflammation other than my own.  Deep burning pain in the gut has a way
of suppressing brotherly love.

FACT 3: After twenty years, I had no idea what was really wrong with me.

       Those people that I had met that were actively involved with
dealing with their illnesses all seemed to have a common trait.  They
all were engaged in researching, reading, and asking about their
problems.  When I was first diagnosed, there was no alt.support.crohns-
colitis group to turn to for help.
       I found myself at reference libraries, alternative medicine
seminars, and watching "Medlife" on the cable access channels.  However,
even ten years ago, there was little in the literature (traditional or
alternative) of value about Crohn's.  And I had no idea that I should be
looking at things other than Crohn's.

A BAKER'S WISDOM

       My first break through came at a bakery in Alvarado, Texas.  One
consistent symptom that I had never been able to suppress was that
classic of Crohn's, the sticky, tar-like stool.  No amount of over-the-
counter medication, no amount or type of prescription drug, no bland or
roughage diet seemed to have any effect.  With that in mind the
following will make some sense.
       How the topic of sticky stools ever came up at a bakery, I don't
know, but it did.  My friend seemed to know something that I was unaware
of, and being a good, close friend, was relishing in withholding it from
me.  She seemed to be enjoying the sense of complete and utter
desperation she was creating.                She grabbed a packet of something from the
back room and we strolled across the street for lunch.
       At the local diner, she drank half of the water from my glass and
directed me to put one piece of everything I ordered to eat into the
half empty (half full, I can never decide) glass.

       The list went something like this:
1) small hunk of grilled hamburger and toasted bun; 
2) dribble of melted cheese; 
3) one french fry with dab of catsup; 
4) goop from the inside of a tomato slice; 
5) spoonful of coffee with cream and sugar; 
6) bit of apple pie with a few drops of vanilla ice cream. 
(Really, I was trying to gain weight).
  
       As I would drop each item into the glass she would sprinkle
something from the packet into the glass and stir it vigorously with her
fork.  I was then directed to pay for lunch, and steal the glass and its
contents by slipping it into my coat pocket.  I walked gingerly back to
the bakery.
       At the bakery, I was directed to sit at a table and hold the glass
between my hands while she got some "additional items."  She collected
a clove of fresh garlic and a press, a small glass bottle and came back
to the table.
       When I put the glass on the table I was moved to say the least. 
The putrefying mass in the glass was bubbling and rising into some 
sci-fi amoebic monster.  "Put your finger in it", she demanded.  Yes, it
was indeed sticky.  If you haven't guessed already, her magic packet
contained baker's yeast.  And what, I said, does baker's yeast have to
do with my innards.
       Ignoring that remark she said that we were going to simulate a
yeast die-off.  She deftly plopped the clove of garlic into the press
and dribbled the oils into the glass of bubbling goop.
       Within just a few minutes, the bubbling, expanding sponge monster
began to rapidly contract.  It contracted back to a slime on the bottom
of the glass with a cloudy liquid floating on top.  I was once again
directed to touch it.  This stuff was like wood glue.  She then decanted
off some of the liquid into the bottle.  Out back of the bakery, she
prodded one of the local fire-ant mounds with a stick.  These guys do
not need much prodding.  As the ants began to swarm, she poured the
liquid on top of the mound.  In just moments, the little nasties were
heading back to Mexico.  "The juice is alcohol and toxic yeast waste"
she remarked, "kills'em dead."  She grinned at me slyly and said "and
you got a yeast infection."
       Wait one damn minute here. Gals get "yeast". Guys don't get yeast. 
Wrongo.  In all of our intestines, regardless of gender is baker's
yeast's closest cousin, Candida Albicans.  In small, naturally occurring
amounts, in any mucosa, they do us no harm.  However, let them get out
of balance and there is hell to pay.  My lesson, if you got sticky
stools, you got yeast.
       And if you got yeast, you will eventually have a die-off.  The
yeast, while aggressive, are easily killed, especially by things like
(as every baker knows) excessive heat and garlic oil.  When they die,
they release alcohol and toxins.  More than enough to get you sick.  But
they don't all die.  Enough survive to start the cycle all over again.
[See the accompanying report on Candida - ED]

MY PERSONAL CURE

       So I began to research and treat for Candida.  I combined both
alternative medicine with the informed cooperation of my
gastroenterologist who assisted with the anti-fungal drug Nystatin and
gradually weaned me from the prednisone. I altered my diet with the help
of several books about Candida.  I avoided, whenever possible, sugars,
wheat and alcohol.
       The first several months were brutal.  The toxic effect of the die-
off almost got me to give in.  However, the support of friends, family,
and my doctor got me through it.
       It took about four weeks for the sticky stools to disappear. 
Abdominal cramps and gas lasted for several months.  During a very long
year, I had two "bouts" of Crohn's symptoms. During the next year I did
not have any.  It is now four years since I have had "flu-like" symptoms
(and I insist that the one episode really was the flu).  Three months
ago, when I was asked to participate by writing this article, I realized
that I was "symptom free".
       I still watch what I eat, and I have regular check-ups, but symptom
free I be.  No more burning pain in my bowels, no more commode
marathons, and I don't buy toilet paper by the truckload anymore. Now I
buy a few rolls of the really soft, expensive stuff, because life, you
see, is meant to be enjoyed.
       Let me say it again.  I am symptom free, not symptom suppressed,
symptom free.
       
A PASSING THOUGHT

       It was really difficult to write this article.  I agonized over it
for weeks.  I argued with myself and my friends, and I was deeply
embarrassed. I could not conceive of how I would fit fifteen years of
affliction and five years of discovery into "2,000 words or less". 
       But in the end, I did it because I know that someone else can
benefit from what I went through. Someone else need not endure what I
endured, and what I lost over the years.  
       My solution is not THE solution.  If Crohn's is a "catch-all"
diagnosis for numerous causes, then there will be numerous solutions to
be found.  Solutions yet to be discovered.  But my process is your
process.  Search, research, talk, ask, experiment, read, but most of
all, don't give up.

                 -----]The Olde Crohn Speaks[-----
=================================================================

[This column is devoted to answering questions of significance about
Crohn's and Colitis related topics.  It is NOT intended to be medical or
treatment advice, but rather to stimulate discussion on the many aspects
of inflammatory bowel disease -ED]

=====================================================================

Q: Does diet play any role in treating inflammatory bowel disease?

A: According to traditional medical literature, the jury is still out. 
Several reputable sources claim that diet has no effect.  For years
doctors prescribed "bland" diets which had little or no effect on the
progression of the disease.  A debate over "high fiber" vs "low
roughage"  for Crohn's sufferers still continues, but over all, diet is
regarded as relatively insignificant. 
       However, The Olde Crohn has seen over the last several years that
the "diet" factor is becoming a more prominent concern in traditional
medicine.  Probably since alternative medical practitioners have been
quite vocal (screaming about it actually).  According to alternative
medical sources, diet is "the critical issue" in bowel disorders. 
Consider the following:

               1. You are the sum total of all that you eat.  Every cell is
composed of material that you have ingested or absorbed.

               2. There is increasing information that some bowel disorders
are related to severe food allergies or to the effects of Candida
Albicans.  If this is so, then diet is critical.

       Finally, while it is by no means a definitive answer or "cure-all",
many Crohn's and Colitis sufferers who experiment and adjust their
eating habits claim to feel better and have reduced symptoms.  At very
least, diet should be one of the areas of personal research and
experimentation for anyone seeking to reduce symptomology.  The standard
caveat applies: check with your medical care provider to make sure that
your are getting the proper nutrition from any diet.  Be aware that
Crohn's and Colitis reduce your ability to absorb nutrients and that
modifications to diet can have negative as well as positive effects.
_____________________________________________________________________

Q: How do I know if I have an intestinal yeast overgrowth.

A: According to numerous medical and alternative sources, if you have
taken either prednisone or antibiotics for periods of longer that one
month, then the odds are very high that you have a Candida imbalance.
Antibiotics wipe out beneficial intestinal flora and fauna that keep the
naturally occurring Candida in check. Prednisone and birth control pills
provide the yeast with a hormone that accelerates its growth and
conversion into a pathogenic form also increasing your risk of yeast
overgrowth.  The primary signs to check are:

       1. gas and bloating after a sugary or processed flour meal.
       2. rectal itching
       3. sticky stools
       
However, symptomology is only an "indicator" and not a definitive
diagnosis.  Seek a medical practitioner who can perform the accepted
laboratory testing for Candida overgrowth.  If the testing is positive,
then a combination of medication and diet will generally become your
treatment regime.
_______________________________________________________________________

Q: Why is there so much conflict between medical doctors and alternative
medical people? It's so confusing to me, how do I know if I am doing the
right thing?

A: We don't really know, but that does not mean there are no answers. 
The Olde Crohn is conducting research into historical medical practice
to provide some minor insights for a future article, but the answer to
your first question is probably not going to be simplistic.  Note
however, that the split between traditional and alternative medicine is
not as pronounced elsewhere as it is in the United States.  Medical
doctors in Europe, for example, seem to successfully blend both
philosophies.
       It is all very confusing, it is very difficult to know what the
right path is if you are not completely informed.  Therefore you must
strive at all times to be informed.
       The "right thing" will always come from the "right source".  The
bottom line is, IT'S YOUR HEALTH, and you, not a doctor or health
practitioner, is responsible for your good health.  First you must
decide that YOU are responsible. If you are responsible, then you must
decide to be active and "In Charge".  Then you will be able to determine
if your health professional is supporting you in asserting that
responsibility.  The rest is simple.  Seek out and work with those that
do, reject and avoid those that don't. Enough said.

======================================================================
                  HEALTH NOTES FROM THE WAITING ROOM
======================================================================
       It appears that all inflammatory bowel disease sufferers have
several serious "secondary" symptoms in common.  Aside from the pain and
fever associated with Crohn's and Colitis, these common symptoms prove
to be the most taxing on individuals, often affecting their ability to
function normally even when the pain and fever are suppressed.  This
column is devoted to discussing and understanding the often overlooked
parts of a full treatment regime.
========================================================================

THIS ISSUE'S TOPIC: ANEMIA

       Anemia is characterized by a reduction in the number of circulating
red blood cells and by the reduced volumes of hemoglobin.  As red blood
cells are the vehicles that carry oxygen to the cells, a reduction in
their number causes a concurrent reduction in available oxygen.  This is
usually manifest in overall feelings of weakness, vertigo, headaches,
and a chronic feeling of "no energy".
       Generally speaking, inflammatory bowel disorders promote
"nutritional anemia" in that the root cause of the problem is vitamin
and mineral deficiencies that reduce the number of red blood cells.
       Perhaps the most common and pervasive problem, anemia in Crohn's
disease may be multifactorial. The anemia may primarily be due to
chronic inflammatory changes of the intestinal lining. It has been
suggested from several university studies that vitamin deficiency caused
by mucosal blood loss and malabsorption due to inflammation are the
major contributors to this pervasive anemia.

The inflammatory bowel sufferer should consider the following:

1. Due to malabsorption of your food intake you probably are chronically
deficient in most major vitamins and minerals, especially B-12 and iron. 
The danger of diet experimentation, especially in leaning towards a
mostly vegetarian diet is that these diets are low in sources of B-12. 
If you already have difficulty in absorbing B-12 from meat, you will get
no B-12 from a vegetarian diet.
       In the case of iron deficiency, the problem is likely caused by not
only malabsorption, but by blood loss from the mucosa.  Tar-black stools
are one indicator of such blood loss.  However, the lack of iron in your
system may also be a result of the progress of the anemia.  The more
severe the anemia, the less iron that is absorbed and processed. 
Females who are menstruating experience a natural lowering of their
systemic iron that is then naturally replaced by diet.  The complication
of inflammatory bowel disease prevents the rebound of dietary iron.

Some Solutions:

       The quality of diet, while it is important in your overall health,
is not a sufficient answer for inflammatory bowel induced anemia.  Since
the problem is really one of absorption and not intake, the quality of
the diet may have little or no noticeable effect.
       The next avenue to consider is vitamin and mineral supplements. 
However, their absorption in the intestinal tract may still be minimal. 
It has been suggested that the concentration of vitamins and minerals
caused by supplements can overcome the deficiencies by sheer volume. 
However, most reputable medical sources warn against "mega-dosing" and
the toxicity associated with certain vitamin and mineral
superconcentrations.  Statistically, the taking of a few vitamin and
mineral supplements, while they may have some small effect on your
systemic vitamin absorption, are not worth the expense.  Regardless of
the claims made in health food stores, vitamin deficiency and anemia
cannot be cured simply by taking a "super" multivitamin especially if
the root cause is malabsorption.
       Combining the increase in the quality of your diet with a vitamin
supplement will have some positive effects on your overall health,
however, they will not necessarily relieve your problems of anemia.

There are still some alternatives:
       
       First to consider is "sub-lingual" vitamin and mineral supplements,
especially for the B vitamins. The supplement is a liquid or gel taken
orally and absorbed by the mucosa of the mouth thus avoiding the
inflammation of the digestive tract. There are commercially available
and available by prescription sources of sublingual vitamins.  The use
and effectiveness is still not firmly established, however, preliminary
studies are showing that the level of anemia can be reduced by
sublingual dosage.
       Second to consider is injectable supplementation.  So taken by
injection, the vitamins and minerals go directly into action in the
blood stream.  Your physician can discuss these options with you,
however, we suggest that you do some basic research into these
alternatives and meet with your doctor as an informed patient.
       The lack of energy that makes you less functional in your world is
not something that you need to endure.  The lethargy and resultant lack
of performance is not something that you should allow to reduce the
quality of your life.  These things are the result of anemia common to
inflammatory bowel sufferers and can be controlled and reduced if not
eliminated. Unfortunately, they are not aggressively treated nor are
they effected by the medication that controls your inflammatory
symptoms.  Take the time to research anemia and supplements and go see
your health practitioner.  Your good feelings may be only a vitamin
away.

RESEARCH REPORT: The Role of Intestinal Yeast in Bowel Disorders

========================================================================

The following article is an overview and condensed summary from Novus
Research Report No. A-66013 "Candida Albicans and Inflammatory Bowel
Disease".
[Full report available by mail - see Report Section -Ed]
========================================================================

I. Overview

       Current research indicates that Candida Albicans Syndrome, loosely
described as an overgrowth or imbalance of intestinal yeast, affects one
third of the total U.S. population.  The syndrome is characterized by a
series of chronic disorders affecting digestive, lymphatic,
reproductive, urinary and endocrine systems, with lesser involvement of
the cardiovascular and muscular systems.
       Candida Albicans is a yeast [fungus] present in and on most of the
human body and is normally controlled by the human immune system and the
usual bacterial flora present in and on the body.  However, when a
negative change takes place in the intestinal flora which impacts the
growth of the suppressant bacteria, the yeast begin rapid over
production especially in the colon.  The yeast colonies secrete powerful
toxins that are absorbed into the bloodstream causing chronic diarrhea,
skin eruptions, cramps and chronic lethargy.  Localized overgrowth
results in vaginitis, oral thrush and skin rashes.
       While not a disease, the overall collection of symptoms are
referred to as "candidiasis" [candi-DY-AS-is].  The syndrome,
candidiasis, was recognized sixty years ago as a result of the
interaction of Candida Albicans [then known as "Monilia Albicans"] with
body tissues and fluids resulting in vaginal, mouth, throat, and
gastrointestinal infections.  Recent research has shown that Candida
Albicans can affect all cells and fluids and is a complication in AIDS,
a contributor to early death in cancer, and a source of male and female
infertility.
       The Candida yeast colony normally lives as a saprophyte, that is by
consuming dead tissue rather than living cells.  However, the colony can
become a pathogen when it is allowed to grow beyond its current food
supply or when an event impacts the growth of the bacterial colonies
that limit the Candida colony's expansion.  Such events include the
introduction of antibiotics, cortisone, birth control pills, or
artificial hormones.  The Candida colony is not directly effected by
these drugs, and when the competing bacteria is killed, the Candida
expands rapidly.  The colony overgrows its normal food supply and easily
makes the transition from saprophyte to pathogen and continues to thrive
on living tissue.
       The Candida colony is therefore "opportunistic" as they will
overgrow whenever the body's resistance is lowered by nutritional
deficiency, infection or a debilitating agent or drug.  The colony will
increase its area of tissue involvement after conversion to the
pathogenic form.  This growing tissue involvement will ultimately result
in death from blood poisoning known as Candida Septicemia.  The role of
Candida in blood poisoning and death has recently become more evident as
physicians treat AIDS patients whose immune systems are ineffective
against the pathogenic effects of Candida overgrowth.
       The Candida colony that exceeds it environmental food supply will
readily transform from its rounded yeast form to a puncturing mycelia
form and in doing so secrete numerous toxins.
       The interaction of Candida is complex.  A minimum of 80 known
toxins [antigens] are secreted by pathogenic colonies to which the body
creates a specific antibody.  These fungal antigens often stimulate
nonspecific reactions which cannot be directly diagnosed, often
resulting in a symptomatic aliment being labeled as " non causal and
incurable".  However, when the reaction to the antigen is specific to a
body system, it can be misdiagnosed.  The result of a misdiagnosis can
result in a treatment that actually accelerates the growth of the
Candida colony.
       The common misdiagnosis is often placed under a general symptomatic
title like Irritable Bowel Syndrome or if specific to an anatomical
area, Regional Enteritis and if a more specific site can be located,
Crohn's Disease.  Then, what is actually inflammation caused by Candida,
is treated with the powerful anti-inflammatory cortisone.  The resulting
introduction of corticosteroid to the gut results in a dramatic increase
in the Candida colonies.  While the corticosteroid then masks the
increasing inflammation, it continues to assist in the colony growth,
making the symptomatic disease become both chronic and incurable. 
Numerous research sources report a direct fact: In every case of
corticosteroid use, the patient has demonstrated a severe increase in
Candida pathogenic colonization.  In short, the use of cortisone for
more than a few weeks, results in Candida overgrowth and pathology.
       
II. Candida Symptoms

       Candida overgrowth will manifest in the following general areas
ranked in order of significance:

               1. gastrointestinal and urinary tract disorders
               2. allergic reactions
               3. mental and emotional disturbances
               4. endocrine system compromise and eventual exhaustion

       The primary causative agent in Candida overgrowth is antibiotics. 
Introduced into the body to deal with specific infections, or
accumulated through the consumption of meat products [primarily beef and
chicken] containing antibiotics introduced in the animal feeding
process, these antibiotics kill intestinal bacterial flora.  It is the
bacterial flora that directly restricts the growth or conversion of the
Candida colony.
       The secondary causative agent is the use of corticosteroids,  used
as anti-inflammatory agents or introduced also in meat products or birth
control pills.  The yeast readily binds to the steroid molecule causing
it to form budding hyphae, which are branching tendrils and filaments. 
These filaments form an enzyme known as phospholipase at their tips
which allows the filament to penetrate cellular walls.  The action of
this enzyme produces peroxide as a byproduct which accounts for
localized inflammation such as gut wall distress and skin eruptions.

III. Nutrition and Candida Overgrowth

       The overall research literature suggests that an immune deficient
state caused by malnutrition or poor nutrition is a "precursor" to
candidiasis.  The malnourishment appears to be a factor not in the
quantity of the food consumed but in the quality.  Candidiasis patients
are often deficient in biotin [Vitamin B] which directly inhibits the
Candida colony from forming hyphae.


IV. Candida Diagnosis

       The following symptoms and events are ranked in order of
significance:

       1.   Use of broad spectrum antibiotics.

       2.   Use of corticosteroid for inflammation.

       3.   Use of birth control pills.

       4.   Use of hormonal therapeutic drugs.

       5.   Chronic abdominal disorders such as cramps, diarrhea,tar-like
            or sticky stools, flatulence, and rectal itching. Stools have
            a strong, foul odor.

       6.   Chronic vaginitis or urinary discomfort.

       7.   Craving for sweets, or yeast made foods such as cheese and                                    
            beer.

       8.   Consumption of sweets or carbohydrates produces a marked                                     
            feeling of high energy followed by a severe feeling of "let
            down".
               
       9.   Fatigue, sudden and uncontrollable hunger, chronic lethargy.
            Gas and bloating after a meal.

       10.  Skin eruptions characterized by painful swelling, burning and
            redness.

       11.  Feeling of incomplete emptying of the bowel.

       12.  Pain and cramping from eating meals with garlic.

       13.  Urination difficult or with dribbling [male only].

       14.  Coating on tongue which is difficult to remove.

       15.  Irritable or moody before meals. Stomach "growling" is                                       
            frequent both before and after meals.

       16.  Painful joints particularly knees and fingers.

       17.  Strong lights are painful to the eyes.

       While tests are available, diagnosis is usually accomplished
through a detailed review of the patient's medical history and by a
direct response to a specific treatment.  Since Candida Albicans is
found benignly over much of the body, laboratory testing for Candida
presence is of little clinical value.  The important tests that are
available measure the amount of antigens present in the patient's blood
serum.  The level of antibody corresponds to the level of yeast present.
       Some tests that have been used are "Chronic Fungal Disease
Profile", performed on blood serum samples, the Candida Immuno Assay
(CEIA) and the Candida Albicans Antibody Titer Test (CAATT), which also
requires correlation to a questionnaire.
       A new microscopy technique for evaluating candidiasis was recently
announced and is available by Advanced Bio Research of Santa Fe, New
Mexico [505-982-1199].  They have priced the test at $30.00, which is
relatively inexpensive and physician referral is not required.  

IV. Drug Treatment for Candida Overgrowth

       The primary drug used against Candida is Nystatin (tm) manufactured
by Lederle Laboratories.  The drug is a powerful antifungal that kills
a wide variety of yeast and yeast-like fungi.  The drug is safe, with
minimal side effects and is inexpensive.
       However, the massive die off of the yeast colonies has its own
serious side effect known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction [commonly
called the Herxheimer Effect].  As the yeast bodies swell and burst from
the antifungal drug, they release copious amounts of powerful toxins
into the bloodstream.  These toxins can cause violent diarrhea
[intestinal purging], bloating, headaches, nausea and an apparent
worsening of the problem being treated.  Most clinicians regard the
Herxheimer effect as a "positive" sign that the yeast colonies are being
impacted.  The severity of the Herxheimer effect can be modified by the
drug dosage and by dietary preparation prior to the administration of
the drug.
       Other, less effective drugs are also available and are noted as
follows:

1. Amphotericin B: same effects on fungi as nystatin but with                                            
more serious drug contraindications including kidney damage.

2. Miconazole: effects both the yeast and mycelial form of Candida
Albicans.  Available as oral dosage, injectable, and as cream or
ointment.

3. Ketoconazole: Broad spectrum antifungal agent known in the US as
Nizoral (tm).  It is more effective, in some cases than Nystatin, but
has numerous possible side effects with extreme nausea being the most
prevalent and possible damage to the liver.

4. Griseofulvin: A blood stream specific agent with side effects due to
patient hypersensitivity and includes nausea, stomach distress and
headaches.

       It is important to note, that while the drug treatment regimes for
candidiasis are highly effective in eliminating or significantly
reducing the fungal overgrowth in just a brief period of time, if the
underlying causes of the overgrowth are not eliminated, the problem of
candidiasis will return or persist.

V. Alternative, Natural and Holistic Treatments for Candida

       1. Diet: Natural medicine approaches the problem of Candida as one
of diet.  Food is regarded as medicine and is the single most important
element of a treatment plan.  The quality of the diet appears to have a
direct effect not only on the incidence of the disease but on the
recovery process.  A number of dietary programs have been put forth,
many with unorthodox philosophies of food interactions, but most with
beneficial results.   



       2. Lactic Bacteria (Lactobacilli), Probiotics: (in favor of life,
as opposed to antibiotics), are taken orally to implant and replenish
friendly bacteria throughout the digestive system.  As adjunct therapy
it is of great importance in restoring the intestinal balance and
preventing the reoccurrence of Candida overgrowth.  Numerous studies
report positive results.   As a single or primary treatment it is
ineffective due to the underlying conditions that created the original
imbalance.  Coordinated in a treatment plan with anti-fungal agents and
a wholesome diet it can greatly enhance recovery.

       3. Garlic and garlic supplements:  The use of garlic as an
antifungal is a proven and effective therapy against Candida having a
similar effect as Nystatin.  The concentrated supplements are often
rated as "more effective" than Nystatin.  However, the effect of the
garlic is both antifungal and antimicrobial [but is primarily
antifungal] and the balance of intestinal flora can be negatively
impacted.  One of the more effective supplements is marketed under the
trade name Kyolic (tm).  The primary value of aged garlic supplements is
that they are "odorless" and produce less gastric distress than large
doses of natural garlic.  The Herxheimer effect is pronounced in the use
of garlic but the duration appears to be less than that experienced by
a regime of Nystatin.

       4. Caprylic Acid: This short chain fatty acid does not directly
kill Candida but has a powerful inhibitory effect on the yeast's growth
and ability to form hyphae and filaments.  The colony tends to "die out"
by attrition.  The most rapid effect of caprylic acid is the relief of
vaginal and rectal itching.

       5. Pau D'Arco Tea: Derived from the bark of the Teheebo tree [and
marketed in some areas as Teheebo tea] it is a mild antifungal that can
be beneficial as an adjunct to Nystatin or garlic therapy.  The tea, if
consumed regularly has shown synergistic effects.

       6. Antifungal Tinctures: A homeopathic product known as
"AquaFlora(r)" has been making news as an effective antifungal/antiyeast
and appears to be equal, if not superior, to Nystatin in potency and
speed of yeast elimination.
       
VII. Conclusion

       The role of Candida Albicans in chronic bowel disorders is clearly
determined.  The role of steroids and improper diet have significant
roles in the onset of candidiasis.  Testing and evaluation of a patient
for Candida Albicans overgrowth is required before any treatment regime
for chronic bowel disorders is commenced since many treatment regimes
can worsen candidiasis.

**********************************************

"The Yeast Syndrome"

John Parker Trowbridge, M.D.
Morton Walker, D.P.M.
Bantam Books ISBN 0-553-26269-6

Both Trowbridge and Walker have impressive credentials.  Dr. Trowbridge
is a pioneer in nutritional medicine and Dr. Walker is a highly regarded
medical journalist.  Rather than list their long resumes in this field,
suffice it to say that they constitute the "council of elders" when it
comes to Candida therapy.

The book is somewhat technical, but is probably the most complete
discussion of Candida to come out of either traditional or alternative
medical sources.  Of great significance is a summary of "candidiasis"
(yeast overgrowth) symptoms and the most detailed evaluation form we
have seen for diagnostic and evaluation of Candida's role in your
medical condition.  The book transcends irritable bowel syndrome and
connects the potential and diagnosed role of Candida Albicans in a
number of previously "incurable health problems." 

The evaluation forms alone are well worth the price of the book.

"The Yeast Connection"

William G. Crook, M.D.
First Vintage Books ISBN 0-394-74700-3

Dr. Crook was one of the first "traditional" medical doctors to
recognize Candida Albicans as a direct cause of chronic irritable bowel
syndrome.

The book is written in a clear language with numerous, understandable
charts and graphs, free of medical jargon, and contains valuable
insights into this relatively unknown health problem.  We came away with
a more precise understanding not only of the action of Candida on human
digestion and health, but a new perspective on "incurable diseases".

"The Yeast Connection" was a national best seller in 1983 and the latest
edition contains numerous updates and new information.

"The Body Ecology Diet"

Donna Gates M.Ed.
BED Publications ISBN 0-9638458-8-8

This is a book about Candida written by a Candida sufferer who has
overcome her health problem.  This appears to be the most recent book
published (1993) dealing with Candida and draws on a wealth of new
information coming from the research community.

Granted, the diets are strict and sometimes quite severe.  However Ms.
Gates leaves us with the promise that "if you have the will power to
follow it [the diet] for three months to a year, you will become well
enough to eat [pizza, hamburgers, and deserts] again, but not to
excess."

We highly recommend this book to anyone that is having problems dealing
with Candida.

"The Candida Control Cookbook"

Gail Burton
Aslan Publishing ISBN 0-944031-49-8

The foreword to the book is written by Gail Nielsen M.S. who is the
founding director of the Candida Research and Information Foundation
[see the directory lists at the end of "The Olde Crohn"] and starts
with:

"So much of what is pleasurable in our lives revolves around food."

Ms. Burton is a gourmet cook who attacked the problem of severe diets
with skill and panache not normally found in medically related diets. 
As a consequence, the recipes are not only appetizing and delicious,
they are simple to prepare.

If you have Candida and you are marooned on a desert island that has a
supermarket, this is the one cookbook to have with you.

NOTES FROM THE NET
A column of news reports, medical announcements, and surveys about
inflammatory bowel disease, gathered from our newly donated clipping
service.

DR. QUACK'S BLACK BAG
Products and claims that simply don't work.  We tried to get this into
the first issue, but Willy the Weasel (sorry, we meant MR. Weasel, sir),
our liability attorney hadn't reviewed it at press time.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
If you don't write in, not only will this column go the way of bran
flakes, but our letters editor will be quite lonely.  However, in a
former occupation, he used to "pen" those wonderful letters in the
"Playboy Advisor (c)", so he will probably produce a column without your
help, but we doubt it will have anything to do with inflammation.

MED-FACTS
Summary reports from NIH, JAMA, Lancet and other mainstream scholarly
journals concerning state-of-the-art medical therapies and research into
bowel disorders.  Reports complied from donated access to Dialog(tm).

If you have information that would be relevant to the any of above
columns, send them by Email to rmalloy@squeaky.free.org and put the
column name in the subject header.
