it's getting darker earlier and the sun's rising later.  that means less
light to bounce from you to the sun to the moon to the earth to me, back
around to you and the sun again.  less light to influence our emotions, too
little to see the scars and stretch marks.  there's more
time for the darkness to enter -- time when nature gives not enough light to
hold *your* interest in keeping your eyes open, when you naturally reflect
into yourselves -- 

but it means more time for *me* to stay out at night, witness the bad
element, wait for the full moon to blast its cold energy at me with furious
might.  with eyes open, i absorb it into my times and places, it absorbs me
as well -- realizing i fucked pee wee herman in female form -- forgetting
to tell someone that they're violating my personal space
because they're teaching me something -- teaching me how to avoid my own
precious will -- teaching me to absorb the full moon's light -- leaving me
forgetful of where i am.  am i a good listener?  it's what i've been
trained to be -- shoot your light right into my receptacle -- it's not
exactly a garbage can, it sort of recycles -- try throwing in a
chicken.  try a lambchop.  how about some paper?  got a blender?  yeah,
throw me a howitzer.  spy plane?  shoot it in me, i'll grind it up and spit
it right back at you -- no, it never gets full, or hasn't yet.. i wouldn't
want to be around when it does -- don't clog the system, there's something
that just won't process -- no, shut up, i've had enough -- look out, here
it comes -- it's

 driving 
down the street until 

STOP

or doesn't it?  no, i get hit, ouch! i scream, but i'm really just happy
inside as i can feel the 

STOP

there's no blood, blood isn't that important on the grand scale of things,
because it's really just light that's important anyway.  without light, we
wouldn't see things, and certainly different kinds of light have different
smells, and it's never been proven, but i'm sure that the way that light
particles vibrate is what creates a certain thing called Sound and touch is
our interpretation of how any grouping of light particles feel -- what are
quarks?  light.  what is light?  it's the brightness that constitutes our
existence -- we're not striving for happiness or the solution -- the
happiness IS the solution, and it's all around us -- just be awake during
the day, sleep during the night, and it will all figure itself out --
what's so beautiful about the night sky, anyway?  the blackness?  no, it's
the light -- the stars -- without the stars, there would be no blackness,
we would just see farther until we saw more stars, but

STOP

we're too close to the city, the gas stations and restaurants and cars and
spotlights and bank security cameras and flashlights and parking lots beam
their energy up into the sky -- it's quite a waste, because i could be
absorbing it all into my eyes and ears and my nose and feet, too because
they can feel things just as well.  

                        [but if you just wait a minute we'll
                clear the earth's atmosphere and get far enough
                        away that our bumper is the greatest place
                     to see the glowing beacons of hardcore porn]

     [is it my hair
  that smells bad, or 
    my illustrious handjob?]

                   [i'll tell you
                what smells bad, it's
                     that dumb hairdye.]

   [i washed 
      that out months ago.]

                 [take it out of 
                  your freezer already,
                    it's about time for the
                         embalming.]

{ { { {    IT'S STILL IN THE FREEZER??    } } } }

                      {  {  {{     EMBALMING.   } }}}  }

    i can't believe we were that negligent;  leaving my body in the
freezer for that long -- i could have died, in fact i was dead, but that's
something different -- and my friends would come to look at me there, and
not do anything about the mess, because i was bleeding all over the place

STOP

blood is just light, and so is my body.  let's rework that one.

[ TAKE TWO ]

    i can't believe we were that negligent;  leaving my body in the
freezer for that long -- i could have stopped reflecting energy, in fact i
had almost completely degenerated into an unhuman form of flesh and gore --
and my old friends would come to watch my body decompose, and not do
anything about my unkempt state, because i was running out of any
willpower.  

    i wanted to sit up from the freezer and just beat my arms upon
their chests for being such heartless, cold freaks, but i couldn't muster
up the energy -- it had simply been drained so much by

    THAT STUPID GUY AT THE TABLE WHO KEPT REPEATING HIMSELF ABOUT

    or

    THOSE STUPID GUYS AT THOSE TABLES ALL THE FUCKING TIME WHO KEEP
REPEATING THEMSELVES MORE THAN THEY CAN EVER REALIZE BECAUSE THEY'VE REALLY
EXHAUSTED ANY VALUE ANYMORE AND NEED TO MOVE ON AND LIVE A DIFFERENT LIFE

..EXPEL A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ENERGY
..ABSORB SOME POSITIVE INFLUENCE
..FEED THE CHLOROPHYLL OF THE SOUL
"IT'S MY GREEN MACHINE THAT WASN'T A DREAM"
    [apples in stereo?!?#@%$]

    "LICK THE TABLETOP, MAN, IT'S LIKE THE BACK OF ONE 'A DEM TOADS"
    "I DID ENOUGH OF THAT IN COLLEGE MAN."
    "WELL YOU'RE NOT IN COLLEGE ANYMORE, LOSER, SO EITHER DECIDE WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE OR KILL YOURSELF."

    college is the darkest place in the human environment.
    it is an establishment that institutionalizes the right of people
to expose as much of their bodies to as much moonlight as possible
    {and maybe that's why they drink so much beer}.
    so if you're going to college
    sit by the window.
    and if your class doesn't have a window
    leave right away
    and sit next to a tree
    because it will talk to your soul
    about things that you don't know.
    because you're not a tree.
    and your soul and the tree will become friends in the sunlight...
