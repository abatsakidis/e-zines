sucky tomato:
    be my friend
    end over end
    find my nest
    you're the best

have you ever seen a man as dead as eileen?  she's got the black circles
under her eyes and she's found deceased rats under the tables at the
restaurants.  she's worn clothes of dead people and attended funerals of
unknown celebrities.  returning to her house means the greatest victory for
mankind, the total dysfunction of liberty, and cascading mountains of
sublime literature.  hope to jump toward houses of gray shingled rooves,
the doors at the floor with the stairs leading to the stereo, and the
garbage with music and food.  half-eaten, both may be.  heads of half-hair
reading books of jars and bells, free to feel jingles with harmony of
fretting souls.  king of the land rolls over dusty unkempt yards, joysticks
of international freedom.  

treat me to a sundae, treat me to your meal.  release the troubled junction
from the pain that it must feel.  yell NO at the sky, it's not coming down,
land of the lord of the dogs at the pound, grate at my nerve, pull from the
well, sky's getting closer but still it ain't fell, run to the trailer,
tell don of the sound, spinning and swirling, the rain runs around.

grains of the 'leet run trails 'round my feet, wood on the wall of the box
with paper and crayons to draw on our faces and our hands and show to the
mom and say "hi! look at this!"  and smiles come up on faces and express
love and fear because who knows what we might turn out to be?  

but god, we're so sweet right now, and we pee in our clothing, and we play
house in the fibreboard kitchen, look at our little people, they fit so
perfect into the bus.
