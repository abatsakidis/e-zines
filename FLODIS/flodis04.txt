             the zine for tasha & anjee

this is an issue of flodis in which i am floating in the ether.  can you see
me?  can you even see the ether?  you have to look north towards the blurry
fog to see the ether.  then look through the ether.  see my globular mass
in the fog?  there i am.

and i'm pouting.  aww! 

i'm pouting because someone hit me in the face.  not literally, but rather
figuratively.  ouch!  my face!  it fucking hurts!  i will punch my attacker
in the stomach.  i did.  they are now in pain.

i want bagels with cheese.

my friend nick is sitting on my couch playing tetris on what they call a
"gameboy" and it was made by nintendo, which is a japanese company, and the
japanese company lies over the ocean.  my bonnie lies over the sea.  oh
bonnie, bonnie, bonnie, won't you come back to me?  get out of italy!! 
stay away from the spaghetti arms that do you the harm.

the death-ray is aimed at my forehead and it will soon blast through my
skull.  i have no control over it, so just let me know when it's going to
happen.

uncle fucker.

i just took nick home.  now i'm listening to brian eno.  see, i'm not in a
mood to write.  i'm drinking peach schnapps with 7-up and it's quite tasty
and i'm eating a bagel with cheese.  can you diggit?  

what's the point of serving coffee without free refills, especially if it's
in a very small glass and isn't very good?  i mean, that's a f'ing ripoff. 
especially when all of your other coffee drinks are pretty crappy too.

there's a little story about a traffic light.  whenever anyone drove through
this traffic light while it was green, that person's thoughts or wishes
would come true.  whatever they were thinking while passing under the light
would come true.   but if they were stopped by the traffic light, their
thoughts would die away.  there is a traffic light like this in every town.
 you have to find yours.  usually they have a special aura about them, a
kinda plaid aura, like bagpipes.

nick, my friend who was playing tetris, is going to write something in the
next issue.  if you have ideas that you want to share, feel free to send
them my way.

actually, people respond better to being forbidden to do things.  so i will
say DON'T SEND ME ANYTHING.  DON'T.

insecurities.  confusion.  blasphemy.  pain.  sustinence.  retardation. 
slapping your chest with your arm.

i get a gag reflex from drinking alcoholic beverages if they're not
extremely cold.  that blows.

happy birthday.

     tell your friends to baste their turkey with flodis

by the way, i'm bored, and i want to go to sleep.  and i'm too lazy to go
flip the record i was listening to, so i have my headphones on but there's
just silence playing.  and i want to finish these alcoholic beverages
before i go to sleep so as to not waste them.  but maybe i'll do the wise
thing and just sleep.

god, some girls give girls a bad name.  see what my thoughts always return
to?  it's very sad.  i obsess over these types of things.  i am the
personality type (according to that personality test) that is constantly
looking for a soulmate.  so i get frustrated when i'm happy with someone
and there are obstacles.  some people have more obstacles than others, and
i happen to be with someone who has lots of obstacles.

i think that if you like a person a lot, you shouldn't hold back.  we're
only alive for so long.  getting hurt is just part of the game.  if you
hold back in a relationship, the person you care about will leave you, and
you're going to be hurt anyway.  so dive in head first and see what
happens.  live life to its fullest.  seize the day.  

dead poets society probably seriously fucked me up.
