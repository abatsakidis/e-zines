             the zine for tasha & anjee

--

the mandarin orange jeep sits on the street waiting for you to hop in.  it's
got yellow flowers painted on its side and it is very dainty.  you know
it's safe to smoke cigarettes in the jeep because it has no top and you're
going fishing.  it's always a given that when you go fishing you can smoke.
 what good would fishing be otherwise?

and you got to the old fishing hole and, sure enough, it was frozen over. 
you & dwayne went down to the ice in the coats you'd had for years.  dwayne
yelped and jumped and you looked over at him.  there was a twelve foot
plastic penguin fishing on the side of the lake.

you & dwayne went and got the spatula and knocked over the penguin.  he did
not really react at all.  you began a fire under him and he exploded like a
burnt marshmallow.

-----------------------

remove the rifles from the hitches of your truck.  you surely will never be
rear-ended, but should you have to reload, you'd have to stop driving and
pull over.  you'd throw your empty box of vantage lights out the window and
it would hit a beaver on the head who would be confused and look around to
see where it came from.  

and the beaver would never find out either, because a few minutes later it
walked down to the pond where it was eaten by an alligator.  so was a boat
with your aunt and uncle.  they screamed for help beforehand but when
tarzan swung through the forest to rescue them, his vine broke and he fell
in to the water and was knocked unconscious.  they tell me that "baby" the
dinosaur will be on the scene soon to assess his situation.

meanwhile you should fall down the water, ride the slope, reach the bottom,
get out, dry out, and then pee on your face in celebration of a job well
done.  like climbing mount vesuvius, nothing can compare to hunting and
then peeing on yourself.
