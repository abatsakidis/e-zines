             the zine for tasha & anjee

it was later discovered that the nec turbografx 16 could display 128 colors
on screen at one time, allowing a near arcade-perfect version of street
fighter two turbo championship edition to be released for the system.  this
version was highly regarded by reviewers, who said that it was the best
home version of the game.

sadly, the turbografx 16 never quite caught on in the united states, and the
game was never released in america for this system.

the imported version is highly coveted among collectors.  after its release,
it was widely available from import shops, but now it is extremely scarce
and long out of production.  most remaining copies were bought up years
ago.  

good luck finding one.

and good luck finding a hat that fits your head, because your head is a very
odd shape.  i don't think that many hats are made to fit a head like yours.
 you might have to go to the "big & tall" mens' shoppe to find a hat able
to fit snugly on your weird-ass head.

orange?  i don't think so -- they couldn't fit in an egg carton, neither
could my hand, because the egg carton is too long and narrow.  elite wisdom
is not for the faint of heart, a strong will and iron stamina are required
for the perusal of these fine beverages, i'm afraid, because a scary
vampire will pop out from behind our furniture.  i asked him to take off
his mask and he did and he was actually a nice guy who was just hired to be
a vampire who hid behind our furniture.  i took him out to lunch and he had
hash browns and gravy.  i don't like hash browns very much unless they're
crunchy so i didn't eat any of his hash browns and they didn't have blood
in them but he put a lot of ketchup on them and ketchup looks like blood in
a way.  i've never seen an awful lot of blood up close though i have bled
profusely from various places in my body in the past.  recently i have only
bled out of every pore of my skin at a few scattered times, like when the
plastic shard flew at me and out popped its hand, holding a sign that said
"stop, now, what's that sound?  everybody look what goin' down" and it was
a sign of providence, rhode island.  

rats that look like dog-bats hop around on the purple path that connects the
creepy castle to the flaming forest and the grape ape.  mr. x walks along
the path until he sees an egg on the ground.  it's of a whitish colour, and
it seems to resemble a bird egg.

"damn dog-bat rats," said mr. x, as he pulled out his shotgun and
obliterated the egg on his path.  out came golden nuggets which he loaded
in his pockets and started walking toward las vegas.  he didn't make it
there because the path he was on only connected three things -- the creepy
castle, the flaming forest, and the grape ape.  

"did i see something shiny come out of the egg on the path?"  asked the
grape ape.

"why, yes, grape ape.  how big are your hands?"  replied mr. x.

"they seem to be quite a bit larger than your entire body," said the grape
ape.

"well, grape ape, i will give you two golden nuggets if you will carry me in
your hand to the mythical fun palace known as 'las vegas'" mr. x said.

"yes, yes i suppose i could do that, i could trade the golden nuggets to a
turkey who likes to eat shiny things and choke on them, and while the
turkey is eating the nugget, i can watch the large bulge travel down the
turkey's long slender neck," grape ape told mr. x.

"yes, you most certainly could do that.  and then you could give me the
turkey."

"whatever for?"  asked the grape ape.

"well, i would like to pluck its feathers and use them on my face to make
myself pretty," mr.x replied.

"you are already very pretty, sir," the grape ape told him.

mr. x blushed, and said, "why, that is very much so too kind of you.  fine
ape, do you accept my offer?"

"no.  no, i do not accept your offer, mr. x.  i think you should find a
turkey who would like to eat your golden nuggets, and allow that turkey to
fly you to las vegas.  air travel is catching on with the youngsters these
days and you might catch you one uh dem hot yung girls on the way.  i hear
they sleep on the first date."

"why would i want my date to sleep while we're on a date?"

"i don't know, sir, that's just what i've been told.  so go find yourself a
turkey, i must go back underwater."

mr. x nodded.  "as you wish, fine grape ape.  enjoy your afternoon."

the grape ape made a strange noise of agreement as he sunk his body back
into the pool of water he had been wading in.  at least, it seemed like he
was wading.

"if i had a white spot floating around above my head, i would be considered
'surreal' and would be massacred by the united states government," thought
mr. x.   "lucky i live in new jersey!"
