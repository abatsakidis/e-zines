the smell of donuts in the morning inside the doors that i can't slam, the
blue car the colors of babies carrying me to the parading trucks and parked
grandparents.  it's the morning and the sun is rising and the window is
down because you're smoking cigarettes.  the knobs on the stereo are all
the way to the left, the radio isn't on.  there's nothing more than the
radio, and inside the shoppe there are asian people eating and american
people serving.  

do you get out of the car or stay inside?

i'll tell you what i did,

i got stuck to the metal wire.  if i stood up my pants would have come off!
i didn't want all the asian people to look at me with my pants off while
they were eating long johns.  

it really looked like there was a river over there but it was just the
property that the railroad owned.  they couldn'yt built canals to take
their freight every where by barge, so they just built tracks to travel
trains on.  that's how they got their stuff aroiund without canals.  and
they charged people to have their stuff sent all over the nation.  and that
stuff was shipped, even though it was on a train.  that's pretty odd.  but
now the railroads aren't doing so well financially and there aren't as many
conductors as theere used to be.  and not as many people travel around the
country by hoping on a train, nor do they travel around the country by
hitchhiking in a car in the dark.  i don't want ot see a bunch of strange
people in different cars that i am getting in and out of.  i don't want to
know them and i don't want them to know me.  and they pick me up as i stand
on the side of the road with by bag and my thumb and they take me wherever
they're going, or i get out before then.  

i'm a parasitic leech.  give me your energy because i've stopped producing
my own.  i sit around in an apartment with college students and i drink
beer and watch them play video games.  i don't know what connection is
because i've never had wires jacked into me.  i'm growing very fat because
i absorb everyone elses' energy and never expel any of it.  my belly is as
large as a pregnant woman's and i waddle when i walk.  

clouds aren't as large as i am and you should get off the sidewalk when i
float by because you might run out of room.  i don't want to collide with
your bubble, because when two bubbles meet they either merge or pop.  i
tend to pop, so get out of my way.  don't let me get connected.  i haven't
got wires, just bulbs, and they burn out.  like the college kids i live
with.

but i will come over to your house and i will kiss you and i will go
further than that because i wear barretts in my hair and feed fruit to
children.  i am the nymph of the forest and you will grow to love me.

but back on the subject of donuts, they are all owned by mountains.  

mountains are blue.

i get scared when i see shadows of things that aren't actually here.

why do things move by themselves, especially when they don't exist?  

only things _here_ should move.
