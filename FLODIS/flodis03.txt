	 		the zine for tasha & anjee

in this developed issue of flodis we have texts by trilobyte and by anjee, 
and these texts are amazing.  can you believe the tenacity of some of these
people?  i mean, they pull at the bark of trees with their TEETH.  that's
how tenacious they are.  and let me say, girls, don't be like bubble gum
stuck to a pole in the winter.  because, you know, they way you are, you
should be susceptible to being pulled off the pole.  but, in fact, you're
frozen there, and you're all hard... now there's a text from anjee:

"a display of boredom and mental issues"
- by anjee
- 07/15/99


i would write something but i have nothing to write.  i would sing something
but i have nothing to sing about.  i would eat something, but i have nothing
to eat.  i would love something but i have no reason to love.


the phone keeps ringing and the doorbell is dinging and dinging and dinging
and it's echo'ing endlessly throughout my head.  i cannot bear such an
intolerable noise. help help help, where has my angel gone?  i picked up the
phone and i answered the door, but the echoes did not cease.  they have
refused to stop!  that makes them suck.

a lot of things suck, too


if i were goth, i would even list everything that sucked, too.  but i am not
so i will save that for another time.  beep beep beepity beep and the stairs
creek while my body is too weak to learn stuff in greek.  my soul is being
mellow like the color yellow and my fellow called and said "Hello"

i could think of a whole bunch of rhymes like dimes for limes to put in your
wine to make you feel fiiiiiiiine.  but never is forever & i must make the
endeavor to find my treasure that will make me as clever as ever!


my guitar strings refuse to follow the pattern that i have chosen, they are
rebelling against all that is good.  not like rebelling teenagers.  they just
rebel so they can get attention and feel all love and cherished and cared for
and all that unnecessary junk.  viva las vegas!  gamble, lose your money,
your house, your wife, your children, your life and your dog.  then you can
become a country singer.  people still will not care.

but there are knots in my hair!


become a brave slave, soldier.  listen and accept their decisions as if they
were your own.  believe in what is not real and dismiss all that is.  that
will help you survive!  create your own torture and then use it on a friend.
i lost the keys to these handcuffs, until then i shall be tough and fight
until the skin on my hands is rough.  enough!@$

the lights just flickered as the demons snickered while they got all liquored

[up!]

i apologize,
i have decided to opt for sanity!

- e oh eff.

that is the end of file, and the file was from anjee.  it was a file that
she sent me and ya know what?  i like it.  i am trilobyte.  this is my text
zine flodis.  this is what i make for anjee and tasha.  anjee helped make
this issue of flodis.  anjee lives in canada, which is a country with lots
of open land and trees and some places even have snow all year round.  when
snow covers grass, you can't see the grass.  the snow covers the ground.
some people say it's like a blanket but i think it's more like a sheet
because i used to have really white sheets and the only blankets i've had
were green or brown or orange.  well, those colors apply more to the
comforters i've had in my life.  

i find that i'm more comfortable sleeping on my couch when i'm wrapped up
in the comforter like a taco.  next time you have to sleep on a couch,
rather than just resting a blanket on top of you, try wrapping yourself in
the blanket.  if you're vegetarian, you can be the lettuce of the taco, but
if you're carnivorous, you can be the meat.  if you're omnivorous, like me,
then you can be the meat and the lettuce and the cheese.  if you are
bisexual, you can be the white cream.  because we know that bisexuals are
all about white cream.  and it don' matter what kinda tube you be gettin'
dat shit from.  "life's a dream when you gots da cream."  that's what Leroy
used to always say.  he rode the city bus a lot and wore glasses.  those
glasses never got stolen.  i don't think.  i mean, he wouldn't have worn
them if they were stolen.  lots of unfortunate people would end up with
their glasses stolen and then they couldn't replace them.  they were too
poor.  they couldn't afford the seeing-eye dog to help them get to the eye
doctor.  and they couldn't afford the glasses once they got there.  they
could afford hats, though.  maybe they stole the hats from the people who
stole their glasses.  and if they exchanged keys, Leroy could drive the
glasses-thief's car, and the glasses-thief could get into Leroy's house and
eat his chips.

there was a kid at my middle school who was quite retarded.  his name was
Tony and he stuck his tongue out while he talked so you couldn't really
understand him.  what he had to say wasn't really understandable anyway.
i saw him in the hallway one day when he was being scolded for being in the
phase he was in.  you can say that all people go through phases, and all
people learn from these different phases.  tony learned that it wasn't good
to punch people who wore glasses.  that was the phase he was in.  all the
other retarded kids in his retard class who wore glasses would get punches
from tony and tony wasn't happy about these kids.  so the teacher was out
in the hall telling him not to punch kids with glasses.  i think his next
phase was punching kids with hats.  

there was another time in high school when tony had to be scolded.  we were
all eating in the cafeteria (all, meaning me and a bunch of people) and
tony stood up on his lunchtable and started waving his arms wildly and
bleeting at another mentally incapable student.  people began cheering for
tony, so he started dancing on the table and waving his arms.  then he
played air guitar.

a teacher cut abrupt tony's 15 minutes of fame by picking him up off the
table and trying to hold back laughter while scolding him.

at my high school, a field trip for the retarded class was to walk around
the school and pick up litter.  my class sometimes got to go other places,
but their fun was picking up litter.

my school district sucks.

[i'm not goth, nor am i a country singer, which means that people think 
i suck, but i can't talk about the stuff that sucks, so i can't talk 
about myself, though i will talk about my friend]

---------------------------------------------don't use scissors

+ you like me?  i like you.  oh wait, you don't like me.  fuck it.

+ grab another apple, it's time for a snack.

here's some poetry:

..
..lightbulbs live longer than moths
..     

       me with my dusty broken wings
    i was nibbling on some piece of garbage
        when someone turned you on.
   you're hanging there on the ceiling up so high
         so pretty
              hi there

         your brightness seems to draw me
       can i strain myself to fly?
          i can try to go up high
               i can push myself 
                        here i come


                                 yeah 
			 this hurts
                              but i think i
                                 can make it


                                 can't you meet me 
                                    halfway?  this is

                                      quite a 
                                      challenge.  your 
                                   flicker
				    beckons me
                             
					but

				  the air is 
					so 
			  		 thick
	 			  &  heavy

						you're so 
						far away

			i
		can't

	make it.

i wrote that.  i was inspired by an email i was writing to my girlfriend.
it wasn't a happy email.  in fact, we aren't really happy right now.  but
that's a poem i wrote.

actually, she could be happy because she likes conflict.  in response to
some of the email i put in the last issue of flodis, she wrote lines like
these:

"I don't want your world.. and I won't give you mine. My world is my own and I
am the center of that world."

"Sorry Tim, I am out of the phase of "trying on/out" new things. I have found
my shtick in life. I know what/who I get along with and I know why. I know 
the boundaries of my heart and mind and I know when not to mix them with 
others."

"Being your girlfriend does not entitle you to ANYTHING."

"I will not work to make someone else happy. That isn't my job, that isn't my 
responsibility."


So a lot of people would define her as "a bitch".  

Hmm.

Yeah, you could probably say that.  She's a bitch once you try to get
something out of her that she doesn't want to give to you.  A dime, a
conversation, a phone number, a kiss, an embrace, an ounce of care.  

I could either stop trying to get things out of her, and just let the
relationship remain as it is, or I could end the relationship, and miss
her.

There are a lot of fish in the sea but most of them are bad kissers.

Word of advice:  Don't tread on treated soil barefoot.

If it is treated with chemical fertilizer, walking across it barefoot can
hurt your feet and make you sick and bad things.  If it is treated with
animal feces, it will make your feet smell icky, and will feel squishy as
you walk across it.  Don't drive your heavy car on a moist mountain of
putrid feces.  I don't recommend it.

Don't fall in love with someone you know you shouldn't.  Your car might get
stuck and it will take lots of friends with shovels to dig you out.

Your mileage may vary (YMMV).
