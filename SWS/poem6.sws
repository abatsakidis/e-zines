Honey
Dungeon Master

Hi, my name is Honey
I have a lot of money
I got it from being a whore
But all the men thought I was a bore
I need a vacation, not an inhalation
of sleeping gas for getting a masectectation
This poem is making no sense
My brain is going a-hense
What happened to prosperity and peace?
And how am I going to pay the lease
on the car that I haven't even the keys?
