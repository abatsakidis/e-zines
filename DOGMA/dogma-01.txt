        READ ALL ABOUT IT.  The commercial industry has yet found another way
to annoy the hell out of everybody, and this time they are taking it to a
much higher leve, and annoying.

        The WWW, world wide web.  Something at first used for small little
pages for an individual or a few people that form a company, now, everybody
from your favorite cars, to your favorite breakfast time cereal, have a web
page and are showing them off to you.

        You ever watch TV lately?  Watch, almost HALF of the commercials you
will see on TV now will have a web address at the bottom of it.  Why are they
gaining so much popularity?  Simple, it all started the day I started getting
into the webs, well, not really, but I am a great deal of it and you should
keep that in mind while you read this article.

        At first most companies would not touch what they still naively said
was the "information superhighway".  Now it seems that everyone has acquired
knowledge, and that nobody should be illiterate towards a home computer any-
more, and more importantly, anything to do with the internet.  Although their
knowledge is limited, it is far more grasped by millions then it was by the
thousands years ago when features like Internet Relay Chat was just the new-
est little fad around from what started as a small government network.

        I for one am against it.  While everybody and their mom's company has
an account, they will destroy what the net originally was, damn well and ever
so welcoming confusing.  Now with Bill the Gates, IBM's OS/2, and other such
GUI based operating systems, people can double click like a mad man, when they
do not even know what is going on in the background, which is a full fledged
shell.  You can literally (and I have seen this recently) have almost NO
idea of what a computer is, and still go online now.  The companies think that
if they will follow the future consumer with a piece of toilet paper ready to
wipe the consumer's ass, they just scored another few bucks.  I know that it
is not a bad thing to expand your horizons, but when it comes to something
like the net, it should be left alone, and only to those who know what the
hell Linux is.

         It seems almost not too long ago, only a few thousand people were
using the internet, because only a few people could understand how to handle
a unix based shell.  Now if you got a mouse, you have your ass PADDED along
the goddamn way, and everybody will be there to help you through.  Let's put
this to the test.

        AOHell, er, AOL.  I called them up, I don't keep their disks when they
send me a disk a week (they want to brag that mistawho graced them :).  I
re-installed AOHell, er, AOL, sorry, again and started to double click like a
mad man.  I couldn't stand it, I deleted windows and re-installed my old Pro
Comm Plus for DOS, very old, eh?  I got an account on netcum, called long
distance and everything.  All I wanted to do is check out a web page, and for
my example, it was www.zipnet.com.  I mailed the system adminstrators, and I
literally had my ass helped through everything.  Fuck actually acquiring and
learning everything on your own, NO WAY, if someone else can pat you on the
ass and tell you commands you don't even know the meaning to, then what is the
meaning?  Throw away your Ethernet cards, take down those ISDN lines, it is
not worth it anymore if non-domestic cars can be on OUR goddamn net.

        Call me insane, but this really does make sense.

                      things that annoy me on the net!@#                        

  wh0rd, nIGGUH aRE yOU zICK oF lAMUHZ tYPIN lIKE dIZ?  well i am for sure.
bah dont get me wrong, its not that bad *once in a while* but every minute of
the day can really piss off a irc user.  i mean its not like these people 
that are typing like morons are black!  most of them are 13 year old wannabes
who listen to dr dre and snoop doggy dog.  yay how cute the little surburban
white boy wants to talk like a black gangstah rapper.

  argh, even while im writing this im tempted to spell shit wrong, 'yas know
whats eyem sayin.'  after seeing this 'form' of writing you kind of pick it 
up and then one day notice yourself using it, ironic isnt it.  here i am 
mocking it and im tempted to do it myself.  oh well.  but on with my article.

  another thing that totally pisses me off, is fucking horny pre-pubescent 12-
14 year old who whack off to gifs and cyber sex.  you cant enter any channel
without some little prick messaging you: 'm/f? wanna hot chat? are you horny?
you got big tits? are you wet?'  this is when i get mad crazy loco and fucking
start killing these little perves off the net.  1- im not a girl so, i dont 
know about you (with the exception of TheGuardian) i dont like it when little
boys or *ANY* guys try to have cyber sex with me.  im not a bitch so so whack
off to a victoria's secret catalog you little pervert!

  bah channel takeovers suck as well.  fucking one second you are having a 
cool, important conversation with a fellow irc'er and the next second:
     * You have been kicked off #bah by I_AM_LEET ( <*> eye rewl <*> ) *
bah i hate takeovers.  i mean damn go play with yourself you bored looser. 
dont try to fuck up another persons 'good time' if you want to call it that.
hah.  irc a good time, that a hoot :)  

  the last thing i hate is people who think they own the channel they have ops
in, when they dont even know the first thing about what the channel is about.
and if they dont like you, or you say something they ban you bah!  whats up
with that shit.  wake up mr power hungry looser, its on a '@' it doesnt give
you god-like privledges... or maybe it does hmm.  while on the subject of ops!
what about the fucking op beggars.  here are a few of my favorite beg lines:

  1.  pass me some ops
  2.  y0 nIG wHERE mUH +0
  3   op me damnit!
  4.  im leet, dont worry i wont take over
  5.  op me or ill takeover!@#$  phear me

  bah fuck you loosers, go choke on your own jizm.  heh.  oh wells im tired im
outtie.  if you agree with what i say email me at stig@sectless.liii.com, if
you disagree you eat moose dingle berries :)

              Whats the latest irc game!? #acro bi0tch!

  bah is irc the same ol' fun it used to be?  if sitting idle in lame-ass 
channels and watching lamers flood seems like fun to you, then boy does big
daddy stig got a game for you.  whats that you ask?  'you mean i can take the
finger out my ass and actually do something on internet besides cyber-sex and
downloading warez!@#  hook me up!'  well there tuff-guy alls you got to do is
'/server neato.org' then once connected '/j #acro' and BAMN!  
  
  #acro, what the fuck is that!?  well ill tell you!  its a neat little game
in which: an acronym is given, then you msg acrobot (the game host) what you 
think the acronym stands for (but you only got 60 seconds!), then the channel
votes on which they think is best, and the winner gets points.  pretty leet
eh?  you bet your boots!@#

  heh anyways, there are other ways to get points also.  there is a thing 
called a 'speed bonus', in other words if you answer first you get 2 extra
points.  but if you are as leet as me, you know other ways to get points.
CHEATING!@#  thats right, and im going to let you cyber loosers in on some of
the methods that me, big daddy stig uses.

  one way is to just grab the speed bonus.  ie; acrobot says the acronym is:
ABC, you would just as quick as possible type: '/m acrobot a b c' and woop! 
an automatic 2 points!  another method is while voting, when the voting round
comes you have to vote for the acronym you think is best.  but what if it is
not yours?  what to do?  fucking vote for yourself biotch, thats what!  BUT 
it just aint that simple.  there's a trick to it.  you must change you nick
to vote for yourself, because acrobot dont allow shiznit like that so change
your nick without being suspicious and vote for yourself, and keep changing 
your nick, and vote for yourself again.  you can rack up *major* points this
way trust me.  i once came into a game in the last round with a total of 0 
points and i ended up winning, tee hee :)

  anyways i hope you nigs check out this leet new game because its a lot of 
fun, not to mention better then slapping your ass with a wet noodle!

im outtie2000,

           prevailing as the winner :)
*** Signoff: subzero (Killed (irc.cris.com (irc.uiuc.edu <- 
             irc.cdc.net[cdc4.cdc.net])))

loOpy   : yeap ive got a copy of subkicks.irc

      what would an irc/net zine be without stupid shit?!@#?  stupid of course.
so right here is little one line annoyance things to do on irc.send y0r little
one line annoyance things in, so you can share it with the rest of us.  you must
be on unix, and have an ircii client to do this shit. i offer no support at all 
for mirc, wsirc or any other of those stupid windows clients. if i see you with 
a windows client i just might have to get mideval on youre sorry ass.

/on -public "*";//say $0 $1-
when someone types shit, it repeats it back to the whole channel.  
(!annOyance factOr! %90)

/on -public "*";//nick $toupper($N);//nick $tolower($N)
when someone types shit, you automatically change youre nick to all caps 
then all lowercase
(!annOyance factOr! %70)

/on -join "*";/msg $C yo $0
when someone joins the channel it autogreets them
(!annOyance factOr! %40)
