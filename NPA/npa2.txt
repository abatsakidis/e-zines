NPAcon Spring has been postponed due to "financial" problems. Recently the
stock market crashed. In this crash i lost the majority of the money that 
was set aside for NPAcon. Dont fret NPAcon Summer is still in full effect.

========================================================                       

	Greetings and salutations in the name of the National Phreaks Association. 
It has taken us a little while to get this issue out, but we hope that it 
was worth the wait. Many of you may know that it has been nearly 2 months 
since the last issue of NPA came out, but don't let that discourage you. 
There have been many new developments within the NPA over the past few months. 
I personally would like to thank all of the NPA members for hanging in there 
as long as you have. If it were not for you guys and gals, NPA wouldn't exist. I 
hope that you all continue to show the outstanding participation that you have. 
To our new members, I would like to say welcome to the association. We hope that 
we educate you and make you a better Hacker/Phreak. 
	As Phreaks and Hackers in today's society, we may be misunderstood. What 
exactly do people think when the term "hacker" happens to pop up? Thanks to the 
loving society that we live in, many have a common misconception about us, such 
as thinking of us as being people that wish to break into bank accounts or 
destroy government computers. Hah, right. WE MUST UPHOLD OUR IMAGE, PEOPLE. This 
is why I urge you not to do anything that would be considered just plain stupid. 
Some of you may ask, "What is the NPA in it for?" We are in it for the Know- 
ledge. Because Knowledge Is Power. 
Now, I urge you to go and learn and obtain as much knowledge as you can from the 
following articles.

In Hackerly Love, 

SKaLaR109

-=THE NEVER-ENDING PHREAK SAGA=-
         --journal of a lamer--
         ---by psychrøwR¥the---

     So you wanna be a phreaker? Are all the cool kids doing it? Do you
 wish to find acceptance in the h/p/a/v/c community, the loving family
 structure that you never had? Ha. The 'scene', as the kids call it, is
 an odd thing these days. Perhaps there has always been an elitist
 attitude in the air, but now it is very hard to find information, let
 alone know where to start. This is my saga.
     I started to get into the whole h/p/a/v thing back in junior high,
 around seventh grade or so. This was before the internet had become
 what it is today (ahem, capitalistic opportunistic trash) and I was
 hot shit because I was sportin' the 2800 bps modem. Anyhoo, I had been
 getting into the local BBSes and had stumbled across one or two h/p/a
 boards. I downloaded a few anarchy text files, (Bad Ass Retards comes
 to mind; anybody remember them?) and got pretty into it. I was just a
 little kid with an urge to cause trouble, and had the information to do 
 it with. Hacking was not really (and has yet to be) a big interest
 to me, namely because I just can't motivate myself to learn how to do
 anything. There were several phreaking files, and I had lotsa plans
 for boxes, (this was before the tone dialer red boxes were en vogue; you
 had to solder dem oscillators and whatnots together yourSELF, jerky),
 but I was too young, I think, to really grasp what was going on. This
 little stage in my life went on until my dad got mad at me one night
 for being on the computer and ripped the phone cord out of the wall.
     Well, that sort of ended my relationship with computer communica-
 tion, until several years ago when I got hooked up with an ISP. One
 of my friends, SKaLaR109, had gotten into the h/p scene, and my spark
 for h/p/a (or I should say, 'p/a'?) was renewed. This time around was 
 much different than my early years, though -- I was smarter, had more 
 freedom from home, and could grasp what was going on much much better.
     What can I say? -- I got into it. Since I am basically a beginner 
(or "lamer", as I like to call myself), I started out on a quest to doc-
 ument my development as a guide for future generations. I am constantly      
 exploring, especially in the field, and discovering that many of the text 
 files that are being distributed today are obsolete. Thus, I would like 
 to get more current stuff out on the 'net, and this zine is such an attempt.
     This may sound elitist, but it is very true, and it is one of the
 most important and fundamental things you will learn about the
 phreaking world: You can read as many text files as you want, but your
 knowledge is shit without first-hand experience. For one, the people
 writing text files have no way of forseeing every possibility -- it
 is possible (well, it is TRUE) that, for instance, Bell Atlantic may
 have different cans than BellSouth. I only have experience with Bell-
 South, and while I can give you as many descriptions and pictures as
 you like, they will only be proven unapplicable in your area.
    The best things text files do are: (1) they give you confidence that
 it is possible to do what is described, (2) they give you a general
 idea of what to do, what to look for, etc., and (3) can be distributed
 worldwide, spreading information around. They are shit if people don't
 get out there and PHREAK.
     There is the introduction. Next month, I will get into my first
 exploits: VMBs and red boxes. But, to leave you with something useful,
 I will go over some of the phield phreaking nuances with you. For a
 bulkier source of information, I suggest you search around on the
 net, or (when available) check later issues of TAM. This is intended
 more as a....

      by psychrøwR¥the

 	Listen, there are good boxes out there!! The hardest (yet, in my
 opinion, it is pretty fun) part about boxing is finding a decent box.
 There are some hidden, remote boxes out there, with no houses around
 them, and out of view of main roads. Guess what? They don't work! You
 need a box that actually has lines in it connected to a house.
 	Now, one way to go about this is to go to relatively new suburban
 residential areas. As you probably know, the people who design suburbs
 nowadays are really into cul-de-sacs, dead ends, and other
 contraptions meant to make it tough for criminals to case the houses
 (whatever). In a new subdivision, it should be easy to find some
 lonely street with a lonely house on it, because if the suburb is new
 enough, not all of the lots will have been sold.
 	If you're lucky, it is really really out of the way and the
 residents are out of town, so you can drive down there anytime in the
 day and use the phone. Of course, this is rather unlikely. You'll
 prolly be restricted to the hours of darkness when the inhabitants
 are not looking out the window and/or using the phone.
 	Another box to find is one in an older neighborhood that has been
 grown over with about ten years of vegetation, and there is little
 chance that you will be seen while commiting line fraud. If you do
 choose an older neighborhood, make sure it's not a -poor- neighborhood
 because that is just fucked up. Sure, it's not a great thing to do to
 rich people, either, but c'mon, man.
 	Anyway, the best way to find boxes is at DAYTIME. If you are
 driving around to find the box (which I strongly prefer to walking
 around in my neighborhood where everybody knows me) I strongly suggest
 that you take a friend who knows what he's looking for along with you.
 I have nearly run into mailboxes, oncoming traffic, etc. because a box
 caught my attention. If you MUST go out looking for boxes at night, I
 suggest equipping your co-pilot with a flashlight, to aid in the
 location of boxes. Keep in mind that a car driving slowly shining a
 flashlight at the side of the road is a tad suspicious.
 	Once you've located and named your box, and come back to it ready
 to go, you'll need long nose pliers. Now, when I say long nose, I don't 
 mean needlenose. They need to be about 3 mm broad at the tip. If you 
 have a Leatherman® tool, you are set. You also need a flashlight to see 
 what you are doing.
 	Locate the 7/16 bolt on the side of the box; it should have a
 ring around it which makes it impossible to open with a normal
 socket wrench. OR, if the telco can is the type that is a plastic
 cylinder, you will need to unscrew the 7/16 bolt which is hidden
 under the latch handle. For a box, you only need to unscrew the bolt
 about one rotation or so, until you see the cover 'unlock' (it will
 tilt out slightly). For a cylinder, you will need to unscrew the bolt
 considerably more, until you are able to lift on the latch and, well,
 unlatch it. I say this because I haven't seen any mention of these
 plastic-cylinder type cans in text files, and the TelCo is putting
 them in all the new subdivisions.
 	Now, don't lose that attractive trait of laziness!!! ALWAYS MAKE
 SURE, before you get your tools out, THAT THE BOX ISN'T ALREADY OPEN!
 I would say that more than half of the boxes I encounter are already
 open, you just need to pull the cover off. As far as the cylinders,
 I have seen one or two that you could unlatch (These are such a pain
 in the ass to unscrew, do your phreaking phriends a phavor and leave
 them unscrewed, just relatch).
 	-Goodies in boxes: There is usually a wire gauge and some desiccant
 (silicon pellets) in the new cylinder-type cans. We have also found
 a little bottle of that lubricant they use on the wires. If you want
 to keep these things, go for it. I will update you on any other
 artifacts we find.
 	Now, check to see if the lines inside the box are hooked up.
 Although generally, if you see wires leading from the bolts you will
 have a valid line, we have seen all of the sets of bolts hooked up
 and none of them work. If there is a house next to the box, and the
 line appears to be connected, but you can't get a dial tone, be sure
 that you have tried the following:
  -switching the red and green wires
  -making sure that the alligator clips, or wires, are not touching
  -holding your mouth right
  -making sure that the bolts you have selected are supposed to be
    together (i.e. make sure it is a pair)
  -testing your beige box* at home, or on a line that you KNOW works
 If it all works, then you are able to do whatever it is you do on
 other people's phone lines. Just remember that it's illegal.
 	In future issues we will concern ourselves with the finer details
 of those gray telco boxes on the sides of your house, and also, when
 we are able to do the research, the largest box in the 'hood. Also,
 we will have an update on the newer, larger boxes in neighborhoods
 using fiberoptics.

*Beige box: A one-piece telephone ever-so-slightly modified to act the
 same as a lineman's handset, which enables people to talk on the
 phone direct out of the telco box. The modification? The end of the
 plug is stripped of its modular plug. Each of the two wires that are
 inside the cord are fitted with alligator clips.

How 9-1-1 Service Works

========================================================

 Introduction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

E9-1-1 systems are in operation within all seven regional Bell companies,
several independent telephone companies, and in 1500 emergency operations
centers throughout the United States.
 
Disc: This file was intended for informational purposes only. I take no
responsibility, and am not liable for damage, under any circumstances,
direct or indirect, incidental, or consequential. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 History
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The original 9-1-1 service was first deployed in Alabama in 1968. It was
referred to as basic 9-1-1 (B9-1-1). The service provided routing of
9-1-1 calls to a local police station. Enhancements were made in the early
1980s to provide additional service capabilities, resulting in the E9-1-1 
service that is common today.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 Wireline 9-1-1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

A subscriber dials 9-1-1, a central office switch routes the call to a
selective router (ESA). The router transfers the call to the proper Public
Safety Answering Point (PSAP) depending information specified (by the
ESA), and then passes it on to the CPE and transferred to a PSAP 
dispatcher, who submits a query about the calling-party into the Automatic
Location Information (ALI) database. The DBMS maintains a list of customer
information, such as addresses and other relevant info which keeps the ALI
database updated. Additionally, the originating party's telephone number
is used for call-back if either the caller inadvertently hangs up or the
PSAP dispatcher needs to talk to the caller later.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 Wireless 9-1-1 Operation
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

When wireless subscribers dial 9-1-1 for emergency assistance, they are 
exempt from normal call validation features, such as personal 
identification number (PIN) requests and user authentication. 9-1-1 call
is connected to an appropriate PSAP based on the location of the 
cell/sector. Location-based routing is accomplished via the digit-by-digit
feature, which allows the automatic number identification (ANI) field for
centralized automatic message accounting (CAMA) signalling to be populated
with a number corresponding to the serving cell/sector. On delivery to the
9-1-1 ESA, the information in this field is used to identify the PSAP
serving the coverage area. The call is then routed accordingly.

                                  Just this fone...
 	I am not too sure exactly what it is called.  I think it is an AT&T  
Slimline fone, or something like that.  It is one of those little crappy fones; 
it has a backlit display, flash, redial, mute, tone and pulse dialing, and 
adjustable volume.  I'm not sure if any other fones work...

Anyway, this fone has extra tones.  I don't know what they can be used for, 
or their frequency, but here you go: (I even figured out how to play
                         "Hot-Cross Buns/3 Blind Mice"  =P

Disclaimer:  I have used many names in this text of real people on the
             IRC.  I do not wish any of these references to be taken
             seriously.  They are intended to add an air of humor and
             realism to the text.


  Introduction
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The IRC can be a fun and productive tool for communication over the
  internet.  If used correctly, it can provide many hours of conversation 
  with and about any imaginable person or thing, respectively.  The 
  knowledgeable IRC user will be able to find the channels or people he 
  needs with grace, and use these to his advantage.  The knowledgeable user
  will be able to keep up with kicks, bans, de-ops, and other tasteless
  ploys that other users try to play on him.  A knowledgeable IRC user is
  a good IRC user.
        This guide to the IRC will be split into sections, regarding 
  subject matter.  The sections are as follows:

     1.................What is IRC?
     2.................Hooking in to the IRC
     3.................Basic techniques on the IRC
     4.................Operator status on the IRC
     5.................Useful techniques on the IRC
     6.................Other techniques on the IRC


  1. What is IRC?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        IRC is an acronym, which stands for Internet Relay Chat.  It is a 
  real-time chat network over the Internet.  This means that one person can
  be talking from a computer in Texas, while another person can be talking
  from a computer in Germany, and all speech from Texas will be seen 
  instantly in Germany, and all speech from Germany seen instantly in Texas.
  Real conversations can take place, with no lag.  
        The IRC is split into channels, created by the users.  If you join
  a channel, you are talking to the users who are in that channel.  So 
  people can talk about whatever they want on the IRC.  There are ways to
  have private conversations, also.
        All in all, the possibilities of the IRC are endless.

  
  2. Hooking in to the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There are many different ways to hook in to the IRC.  It is mostly
  done through clients.
        A client is a software program that is on the machine you are using
  to connect to the IRC.  The client connects with the IRC server, and you
  are thus hooked into the IRC network.  This is all around the best way
  to hook into the IRC.  If you are on a fast machine, you will have a very
  fast connection to the IRC, without lag.  This does not take up more then
  3 megs of drive space, so it won't break most users' quotas.  It does not
  keep a process open, so the SysAdmin won't get angry.  And it's very easy
  to install.
        On the other hand, one can set up an IRC server.  For this, you will
  need to have root, and/or own the machine.  You will need access to the 
  Internet Ports on the machine.  If you run a server, you will be able to
  get IRC Operator status (IRCop), which has many benefits.  I will go into
  more detail on this later.
        There are also servers all around the net on which one can access the
  IRC.  These servers are generally European, so people in the United 
  States waste bandwidth when calling them.  The servers are slow, and over-
  used.  Generally, these are useful only if one of the two aforementioned
  techniques are totally unavailable.  Servers are generally considered to
  be sleazy on the IRC, and you may be kicked out of a channel just for 
  being on one.  I would not recommend ever using a server.
        The final way to hook into the IRC is through what is known as
  "raw IRC."  Raw IRC is very low quality.  You are receiving the same data
  that your IRC client would receive, as you are hooked directly into the
  server.  The data is unfiltered, and very ugly.  It is more difficult to
  do anything with raw IRC.  This is definitely the last choice in using 
  IRC.  However, if everything else is unavailable, raw is the way to go.  
  Other than that, forget about it.
         Clients, Servers, and Help packages can all be obtained through
  ftp.santafe.edu.  You will want to get the latest version of the IRC
  II package.  This is the latest IRC client.  
        To install the client package, first uncompressed, then detar it
  into your user directory.  Next, type install, and go through the
  questions which it asks.  It will ask for server name.  Depending on where
  you are located, you will enter the closest server.  The most popular ones
  that I have seen are:
        
        irc.colorado.edu
        irc.netsys.com
        irc.mit.edu
                   
         All of these servers are fast and efficient.  irc.netsys.com is
  slightly more widely used.  After you tell your IRC server all of your
  system/server specs, it will go on to compile itself.  Now, you will have
  an IRC client.  Simply type "irc" to enter the client. I have never installed    
  a server, so I don't know anything about it.
        To go to the raw IRC, telnet to one of the servers, port 6667.
  You will get no feed from the server.  Type: 
           user a b c d [enter]
  where 'user' is the command user, 'a' is the account name you are using,
  'b' is any random number, 'c' is any random number, and 'd' is your IRC 
  quote, which should be between quotes. Next, type: 
           nick username [enter]
  where 'nick' is the command nick, and 'username' is the nickname you wish
  to be known by on the IRC.  You will now see the server's message of
  the day, and you will be able to use the IRC.
        To get to an anonymous IRC server, first you must telnet to one.
  These go up and down too fast to list them here.  They can be obtained
  usually by asking around on bulletin boards.  It will ask for a username.
  Enter the nickname you want to be known by.  It will then ask for a 
  terminal emulation; enter it.  If you have chosen VT100, the server
  will look just like an IRC client.  Most likely the server will be very
  slow.  Use it just like an IRC client.
       As a side note, if you set up an IRC client, it is recommended that
  you add the help package to your system.  It is much faster and better
  then the help bot which resides on the IRC.


  3. Basic techniques on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Once you are hooked in to the IRC network in some way, the next
  logical move is to begin using it.  The following directions will be
  for people using the IRC through either a client, a telnet server, or
  through their own server as accessed from a client.  People using raw
  IRC should enter the same basic commands, but without /'s.  All talk to
  and from channels, and between persons while on the raw IRC should be 
  through the privmsg command.  Once in a channel, enter "privmsg
  <channel> <message>", and the message will go through to the channel.
  If you substitute a person's name for the channel name, the message will
  go through to that person.  
       Basic client commands are:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------   
  Command        Usage               Summary of usage
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  /join         /join <channel>      This command is used to join a 
                                     channel.  If the channel has a key
                                     on it (see operator section), then
                                     the key should be added to the command
                                     after the channel name.  This can also
                                     be used to start a new channel.
      
      For instance, if you want to join #warez, you type:
           /join #warez
      
      But if #warez has a key on it, which is "doomrules"
           /join #warez doomrules
      
      Or, say you want to start your own channel, called "#l0ser" you will 
      type:
           /join #l0ser
      
      You will be in your channel, with operator status.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /nick         /nick <name>         This command will change your IRC 
                                     nickname.  This is the name that people
                                     see you under.

      For instance, if your name is "Lamer" and you want to change it to
      "K00lGuy" you would type:
           /nick K00lGuy
      You will now be known as "K00lGuy."

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /msg          /msg <name/channel> <message>    This command sends a private
                                                 message to a person, or a 
                                                 public message to a channel.
      
      For instance, if you want to call Pot a lamer, you would type:
           /msg pot you lamer!
      Now Pot will know that he is a lamer.
      
      Or, say you want to insult the people on #hack for banning you.  
      You type
           /msg #hack You lamers!  You banned my sorry ass!

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /me           /me <message>        This will make a message come out
                                     as an "action."
  
      For instance, say you want to say that you think U4EA just said a 
      stupid thing, you would type:
           /me thinks that U4EA is a dumbass!
      
      If your nickname happens to be Tremolo, it will come out as:
           * Tremolo thinks that U4EA is a dumbass!

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /leave        /leave <channel>     This will make you leave a channel.
  
      For instance, if you are hangin on #warez, and get tired of sittin with
      Elminster, you can type:
           /leave #warez
      Now, you won't have to deal with Elminster's shit any longer!

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /who          /who <channel>       This will tell you who is on a 
                                     given channel.
      
      For instance, say you are on #lamers, #warez, and #hack.  You want to
      know who's on #hack, so you type
           /who #hack
      It will tell you everyone who's on, their operator status, their user 
      comment, their system's address, and other useless information.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /whois        /whois <nickname>    This will give you information
                                     on a person.

  For instance, if you want to know all about RAgent, you can type 
           /whois RAgent
  It will tell you his comment, his nick, his system's address, what server he  
  is using, and a little bit about the server.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

         
         Those are all the basic commands you will need to get around on the
  IRC, for the most part.  For commands to execute when you are the channel
  operator, see the IRC Operator section.  For more advanced commands, see
  the Useful Techniques section.
         To talk, while on any channel, simply type in your text and press
  enter.  As I stated above, while on raw IRC, you will have to privmsg
  to the channel in order to talk to it.


  4. Operator Status on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If you happen to notice that someone changes the mode on a certain
  channel to '+o <your name>', or you see an '@' symbol next to your name on  
  your IRC client/telnet server, you will know that you have operator status in
  that channel.  This can be a very useful thing to have. Also, operator status              
  will be given whenever you start a channel.
        The main command you will use if you have this status is the /mode
  command.  This command controls all the settings for a given channel.  There  
  are many flags that can be used with the /mode, and the command is typed as    
  follows:
         
         /mode <channel> <+/-><flag(s)> <(optional)name>
         All flags are either + (there) or - (not there).  
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Flag                   Usage
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  o                      The operator flag.  If someone has this flag, they
                         are a channel operator.  This flag requires a name.
  
      For instance, if you are Serpent, and you want to give channel operator 
      status to Pluvius, and you are on #warez, you would type:
           /mode #warez +o pluvius
      and IRC would return:
           *** Mode changed to +o Pluvius on #warez by Serpent
  
      Say he starts to annoy you...
           /mode #warez -o pluvius
      Suddenly, Pluvius has no operator status any more.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  b                      The banned flag.  If you have this, you are banned.
                         If you give this to someone, they are banned.  This 
 				 flag requires a name.
  
      For instance, say that you don't want Y-WiND0Ze in your channel, which 
      happens to be #tacobell. You would give him the +b flag: 
           /mode #tacobell +b y-wind0ze
      and he wouldn't be able to join.  He would be banned.
        
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  i                      This flag makes a channel invite-only.                      
  
      If this flag is engaged, the channel is a private channel.  No one can 
      get in without being invited.  

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  m                      Makes the channel moderated.
  
      This flag, when given to a channel, makes the channel be moderated.  
      This means that only the channel operators can talk.  This is a very 
      useless command.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  n                      This makes it so that no messages can be sent to
                         the channel.
      
      For instance, if Kbg keeps messaging to the channel, asking to be 
      invited, you can add this flag.  Ahhhh...silence. Kbg can no longer 
say anything to the channel, unless he somehow gets in.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  s                      This makes the channel secret. 
  
      If the channel is secret, it will not show up on any channel listings.
      There will be no way for a person to find the channel unless he knows 
      about it.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  p                       This makes the channel private.
  
      The channel, in channel listings, will be listed as "*Private*", instead
      of being listed by its name.  This is good for hiding the channel, but
      letting people know that something is there.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  l                        This sets the max number of users in a channel.
  
      This command is, for the most part, useless.  It's good for having a 
      scaled-down channel where only a few people can come in, so that the
      channel will stay fairly quiet.  Other then that, it's just fun to use 
      to set to neat numbers.  For instance, say you're in #BlueBox, and you
      want to be cool, you set the 'l' flag to 2600.  You do this by typing:
              /mode #BlueBox +l 2600
      Now everyone will see that there is a 2600 and say "Trexer is elite!"
      (If your name happens to be Trexer.)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  k                         This sets a channel key. 
  
      A key on a channel means that a passcode must be used to get in.  This
      sets that code.  It is useful for having ONLY who you want to be in the
      channel.  It is also nice for having a channel where you don't have to
      work and invite everyone, but everyone who should be able to get in will
      have the key.  It is used by typing:
           /mode #keykard +k 494949
  
      Now, to join, someone will have to type:  /join #keykard 494949
      If they don't know the 494949 part, they will not be able to join.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

        There are other irc operator commands, also.
  
                            
  /kick                     This kicks someone out of a channel.  
      
      For instance, say that Maelstrom is being lame, in #lamer.  You type:
           /kick #lamer maelstrom
      Now he's out of the channel.  If he's not banned, he can come
      back in.  If he's banned, the channel is invite only, or the
      channel has a key, he will not be able to get back in without 
      taking the proper steps first.
 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  /topic      This sets the topic on a channel.  
      
      So, say you're in #redbox and you want everyone to know that you are a 
      good redboxer, and your name happens to be SSerpent.  You would type:
           /topic #redbox SSerpent is a /<-RaD 'Boxer!
      Now everyone who comes in will know.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


         These are the main operator commands, the ones that are most used.
  Other modes and a few other operator commands exist, but they are not 
  widely used, and are slightly obscure.
         The IRC operator I am talking about here is not to be confused with
  an IRCop.  An IRCop is a person who has been given a special status by a 
  server which he/she may run, or help to run, or is friends with those who
  run it.  They are operators on every channel on the IRC regardless, and 
  they have the ability to /kill someone, which means to disconnect that 
  person from their server.  /kill is a stupid and useless thing, and is
  not something to worry about.  If you are /kill'ed, simply /server <server>
  (<server> being whatever server you use).  You will now be back on the IRC.
 
  5. Useful Techniques on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There are a few other techniques on the IRC, which did not seem
  to fit in any of the previous sections.  These techniques are not to
  be discounted, though, as they are very useful.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------   
  Command              Summary of usage
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /dcc                 This is one of the more useful commands on the IRC.
                       It is a file transfer command, as well as a private
                       message command.  It cannot be used from an anonymous
                       IRC server.
      
      Say you want to send a file called "ellenude.gif" to lonewolf:
           /dcc send lonewolf ellenude.gif
      Lonewolf will see this:
           DCC Request received (ellenude.gif 39393) from Kilslug 
      The number after the file name is filesize. 
      
      Lonewolf will proceed to type:
           /dcc get kilslug ellenude.gif
      Now his DCC will start receiving it.
                       
      If he wants to see the progress of the transfer, he would type 
           /dcc list  
      He will see the file name, who's sending, etc. If he is receiving 
      the file, he will see the bytes gotten in the "read" column.  If
      he is sending, he will see the bytes given in the "sent" column.  
                       
The other use of DCC is to send private messages.  The only part of the 
IRC which is not logged in any way at any time, according to the IRC-II 
Help files, is by DCC chat.  Say you want to engage DCC chat with Cairo, 
you would type:
           /dcc chat Cairo
      
      If Cairo wants to chat with you, he will type
           /dcc chat CryptKepr
      
      To send a message to Cairo, CryptKepr would type
           /msg =cairo <message>
      Notice the '=' sign.  This makes it a DCC message.
 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /ignore              This allows you to ignore someone.  No messages at
                       all will be received from them.  Period.  The only
                       thing you will see from them will be if you list 
                       members of a channel; they will appear in the listing.
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /away                Marks you as being away.  If someone pages you, they 
                       will receive your away note telling them you're not
                       there.  Also, their page will be logged for you to 
                       see later.  
      
      If you want to tell everyone that you're milking your cow, you 
      would type:
           /away Milking my cow, be back later!
      Now everyone will know what you're doing and why you're not there.
      
      To end, type /away alone.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /mode                There are also personal /mode commands.  The two most
                       important are +i and +n.  
The 'i' flag makes it so that no one can get information on you without 
specifying your exact name.  Someone listing a channel if they are not 
inside it won't see you there if you have the 'i' flag on.
                       
The 'n' flag makes it so that you can't receive any pages (msg's).  This 
is useful if a lot of people are paging you and you want them to shut up.  
Also, if you want to see who is banned in a channel, regardless of 
operator status or even being in that channel, you can type:
 					
/mode <channel> +b
      It will tell you all the people/sites currently banned within the channel.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /query               This will put you on a permanent mode talking to someone.  
      
      If you type:
           /query lestat
      everything you type from then on will go to lestat just like you were 
      msg'ing him.  This is useful if you have a lot to say and don't want 
      to /msg all the time.  
      
      To end, type: 
           /query 

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /bind                This is used to bind special characters to certain
                       actions.  The most important of these is the 
                       IRC_STOP bind.  
      
      To set this up, type:
           /bind ^Z IRC_STOP
      This will make it so that when you type ^Z, you will "shell" out of IRC, 
      making it into a background process.  As many people who use IRC know, 
      it is sometimes annoying not being able to ^Z out.  Now you can, with 
      ease.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /exec                This command is used to EXECute a command from the
                       UNIX shell, without ever leaving IRC.  
  
      For instance, if you want to do a ls -al, from IRC, you just type:
           /exec ls -al
      It will show you all the files in your directory, in your IRC window, 
      instead of you having to ^Z out, or exit out.  You can execute any 
      command that will work in sh with /exec.  

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /load                This command is used to load an IRC script.  
                       
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        
        There are also two important IRC environment variables that you can
  	set.  These are IRCNICK and IRCNAME.  The IRCNICK variable is your default
  	nickname on the IRC.  Once you go in, and your nickname is whatever you
  	set IRCNICK to, it can still be changed by the /nick command.  It is not
  	a permanent setting.  
        The IRCNAME variable sets your user comment to whatever you want it
  	to be.  This is the comment about you that people will see when they do a
  	/whois command on you.
        These variables can be set from the csh command line with 
  		setenv IRCNICK <nickname>
  		setenv IRCNAME "<stuff>"
        Notice the quotes with IRCNAME.  This is an important part of it.


  6. Other Techniques on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There have been many scripts written for the IRC, to do some nice
  fun things. 

  -------------------------------------------------------------------   
  Script              Summary of usage
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  tsunami             This is a flood script, which is designed to drive 
                      a person off of the IRC.  It is very effective, if
                      the user has a good copy of it.  It sends page after
                      page of EI and IE combinations, very quickly.  Some
                      better quality versions send actual messages, and 
                      greetings, such as "Lamer," "fuck off," "leave now,"
                      "Fuck you," "go away," and other fun greetings.
                      This script is very fun to use/abuse.

      It is run under the perl system, by executing the command:
           /exec perl tsunami <username> 
      After which, the user will see several telnet error messages, and the 
      receiver of the tsunami will begin to receive constant junk.
                      
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  utc                 The UTC reply bomb is a script which takes advantage
                      of a bug in earlier versions of the IRC-II client.
                      The bomb "bombs" the client with junk, and causes it
                      to lose connection to it's server, engaging "error
                      0."  This bomb also works on some VMS systems.  It
                      is very fun to bomb an entire channel such as 
                      #gaysex and watch all of them suddenly log off with
                      "error 0."
      
      The script is /load'ed, then is executed, usually with:
           /bomb <username>
      or
           /bomb *   to bomb the current channel.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  vmsbomb             This is a myth, in my opinion.  I have never seen 
                      this script either in action, or in source.  It is
                      supposed to be able to disable all VMS systems
                      regardless of version number.  Yeah.  I'll believe
                      it when I see it.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  icmp                The ICMP bomb is a much talked about bomb on the
                      IRC.  It is, in reality, not an IRC script, but a 
                      modified ping program.  It is designed to destroy
                      logical links between systems.  It's use on the IRC
                      is fairly obvious:  Run it on a server, watch all
                      of the people on the server drop off like flies, 
                      and watch the chaos begin.  Mega netsplit.  (netsplits
                      are times when the servers are split up and not 
                      communicating.)  I have the source to one of these,
                      but I can't get it to work correctly.  If anyone 
                      has a working copy, I would appreciate it if you
                      could get it to me.
      Usage would be:
           /exec icmp <servername>

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Xdcc                There are many versions of this script floating 
                      around.  It is a script which helps to automate
                      DCC sessions.  I, personally, do not use it, and 
                      do not like it.  But many, many people do.  So
                      try it out...
  
      Usage:  The script is /load'ed, then takes care of itself from there, 
      for the most part.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Toolz               A great guy called Yazoo writes a big script for
                      the IRC called Yazoo's Toolz.  These are very 
                      helpful, and has many nice options.  Xdcc was, 
                      for the most part, stolen from Yazoo's Toolz.  But
                      Yazoo knows how to program it much better.  It has
                      many nice commands, such as mega-de-op, flood 
                      protection, ban protection, etc.. It also has nice
                      features such as keeping logfiles, and highlighting
                      important information like pages.  Also, it can
                      be used as a type of bot, as it has the ability to
                      op people automatically on command, and to distribute
                      files on command automatically.  This is a very
                      nice script and is a must have.
      
      Usage:
           /load the script file, then do a /commands for a list of commands.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  (A Command that makes no sense: )
  /ping            hello!?  what the hell is this thing for??  Tells
                   you how many seconds it takes your system to send a 
                   data packet to another user's system, and for their
                   system to send it back.  -- Who cares??
                   If anyone finds a use for this, tell me.

      Usage:
           /ping <username>
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Bots:

        IRC Bots are scripts that act a certain way, and do whatever they
  are told/programmed to do.  Many, many bots are out there, and they do
  alot of different things.  The most common bots are there to give certain
  people operator status when they enter a channel.  The bot has an internal
  list of people that it is programmed to give operator status to, and it
  gives the status to these people.  If you can make friends with a bot
  operator, you can get on the list and you can get ops whenever you come
  into the channel.  
        Other bots are there to distribute files.  This 'zine, for instance
  may soon be distributed by a bot of my programming.  Bots which distribute
  files go around, send people messages, "download the file by sending me 
  this message". When the message is sent, the bot sends the file via
  DCC connection.  
        There is another breed of bot, which I call an IdiotBot.  These
  are bots which sit there, and do anything anyone tells them to do.  They
  are there to serve.  Not just their master, no.  But everyone, on every
  channel they happen to be in.  Say I want ops in #hack.  IdiotBot is
  in there, and the bot has ops.  I just send him a message:
      /msg idiotbot mode #hack +o p_modern
  if you read the area on ops, you would see that this mode is the 
  operator status mode.  Now, I'll have operator status, and I can go and
  do what I want.  These bots have no control, and I urge all operators
  to kill them off on site.  Sooner or later, some asshole gets the ops from
  the bot, and fucks over the channel, pulling all ops out with a script,
  and putting a +m on, making the channel totally useless.  Don't let this
  happen.  Kill IdiotBots everywhere.
        There are many, many other bots.  Some interesting ones I have seen:
  
  - a bot that bans people if they try to ban the people on the bot's list
  - a bot that calls master.. strange, though, master never comes.
  - many different greeting bots "Hi, how are you today?"
  - A bot that tells sexual stories about the smurfs

  Closing
  ~~~~~~~
        I hope you enjoyed the article, and learned something about the
  IRC.  I hope that if your name was mentioned, you found it to be humorous
  and did not take it seriously.  I must now issue a warning:
                           
                           *** WARNING ***
        Do NOT take the IRC seriously.  I have seen too many people go
  crazy over someone on the IRC, get all pissed off, and try to kill that
  person in some way.  The IRC is virtual, it's bullshit.  If someone fucks
  with you, fuck 'em back.  It's that simple.  If you're really mad, go
  beg an operator in #pub or #talk to /kill 'em.  But don't take anything
  outside the IRC.  I've done it myself, and it wasn't worth it.
        Do NOT start flame wars in public on the IRC.  No one wants to 
  hear it, most of the time.  It takes away from the real conversation.
        Just have fun, do whatcha want on the IRC.  No one can fuck with
  you there.  And don't post things on the IRC which you want to keep.
  For instance, a code, posted on the IRC in #hack, will die very very
  quickly.  It's just not worth it.  Be careful who you tell things to
  while on the IRC.  If you tell the wrong person, or if you make a 
  typing mistake and it's broadcasted to everyone...disaster.

Intermediate Hacking
By Heyitsme -- heyitsme@elnet.com

========================================================                       

Introduction
------------
	The whole point in hacking (for most hackers) is to get information. In 
order to get access to all the information, you need root access. Root access is 
total system access, and you can get this by retrieving the passwd file and/or 
brute-forcing your way into the system (either through telnet or dialup).

Methods
-------
	The main method of retrieving the passwd file is to telnet to the system 
you are trying to hack, and login using some default account or an "acquired" 
account. Once in, you get into a UNIX shell, and retrieve the passwd file.

	On UNIX systems, the file that contains the passwords for all the users on 
the system is located in the /etc directory. The filename is passwd. All the 
accounts in the passwd file have encrypted passwords. The one-way hash function 
is a small series of mathematical steps that makes a series of characters which 
is saved in the passwd file. The one-way hash function UNIX uses is a variant of 
Crypt(3). The reason that a dictionary file is needed is the fact that the 
Crypt(3) function cannot be reversed, hence the name one-way hash. It is 
mathematically infeasible to find in any amount of time the string of 
characters from which the hash value came. The passwd file is a series of lines, 
each with user info on it. An example is:

johnsmith:naVwowMManasMMo:10:200:John Smith:/users/john:/bin/bash
username:Hash of user password:grp:user:realname:homedirectory:users shell 
program

 -  Username is the name under which the user logs in.  Usually this is
    accomplished by typing in the username at the username prompt and then
    the password at the password prompt.

 -  Hash of user's password is the target of the cracking method.  This is
    what the hash of each word in the dictionary file is compared to.

 -  grp -> User's group number determines things such as access to certain 
	files, etc.  Used more in the exploit technique

 -  user -> User's number is basically identification for the system.

 -  User's real name is the name the user entered.  Not used by the system,
    but it provides a handy human-readable id of each user.

 -  User's home directory is the directory that they go to when they log
    into the system.  

 -  User's shell is the user interface that the user uses.  Shells include
    /bin/bash /bin/ash /bin/tcsh /bin/csh and /bin/sh 



	If you finally get the password file and all the items in the second field 
are 'X' or '!' or '*', then the password file is shadowed. Shadowing is just a 
method of adding extra security to prevent hackers and other unwanted people 
from using the password file. Unfortunately, there is no way to "unshadow" a 
password file but sometimes there are backup password files that aren't 
shadowed. Try looking for files such as /etc/shadow and other stuff like that. 
If the system you are in is shadowed, you cannot retrieve the 
passwd file without root access.

 Here is a chart of common unshadowed backups

THE INS AND OUTS OF GSM Part 2 of 3
by (\/)@ster Y0d@
mastyoda@concentric.net
========================================================

4.5  Frequency hopping 

The mobile station already has to be frequency agile, meaning it can move 
between a transmit,
receive, and monitor time slot within one TDMA frame, which may be on different 
frequencies. 
GSM makes use of this inherent frequency agility to implement slow frequency 
hopping, where the
mobile and BTS transmit each TDMA frame on a different carrier frequency.  The 
frequency
hopping algorithm is broadcast on the Broadcast Control Channel.  Since 
multipath fading is (mildly)
dependent on carrier frequency, slow frequency hopping helps alleviate the 
problem.  In addition,
co-channel interference is in effect randomized. 

4.6  Discontinuous transmission 

References: [S+89, Che91] 

Minimizing co-channel interference is a goal of any cellular system, since it 
allows better service for a given cell size, or the use of smaller cells, thus 
increasing the overall capacity of the system. 
Discontinuous transmission (DTX) is a method that takes advantage of the fact 
that a person speaks less that 40 percent of the time in normal conversation 
[S+89], by turning the transmitter off during silence periods.  An added benefit 
of DTX is that power is conserved at the mobile unit. 

The most important component of DTX is, of course, Voice Activity Detection.  It 
must distinguish between voice and noise inputs, a task that is not as trivial 
as it appears, considering background noise.  If a voice signal is mis-
interpreted as noise, then the transmitter is turned off and a very annoying
effect called clipping is heard at the receiving end.  If, on the other hand, 
noise is misinterpreted as a voice signal too often, the efficiency of DTX is 
dramatically decreased.  

Another factor to consider is that when the transmitter is turned off, there is 
a very silent silence heard at the receiving end, due to the digital nature of 
GSM.  To assure the receiver that the connection is not dead, comfort noise is
created at the receiving end by trying to match the characteristics of the 
transmitting end's background noise. 

4.7  Discontinuous reception 

Another method used to conserve power at the mobile station is discontinuous 
reception.  The paging channel, used by the base station to signal an incoming 
call, is structured so that the mobile station knows when it needs to check for 
a paging signal.  In the time between paging signals, the mobile can go into 
sleep mode, when almost no power is used. 

4.8  Power control 

There are five classes of mobile stations defined, according to their peak 
transmitter power, rated at 20, 8, 5, 2, and 0.8 watts. To minimize co-channel 
interference and to conserve power, both the mobiles and the Base Transceiver 
Stations operate at the lowest power level that will maintain an acceptable 
signal quality.  Power levels can be stepped up or down in steps of 2 
dB from the peak power for the class down to a minimum of 13 dBm (20 
milliwatts). 

The mobile station measures the signal strength or signal quality (based on the 
Bit Error Ratio), and passes the information to the Base Station Controller, 
which ultimately decides if and when the power level should be changed.  Power 
control should be handled carefully, since there is the possibility of
instability.  This arises from having mobiles in co-channel cells alternatingly 
increase their power in response to increased co-channel interference caused by 
the other mobile increasing its power.  This is unlikely to occur in practice 
but it is (or was as of 1991) under study. 

5  Network aspects 

References: [Aud88, Rah93, Che91, Bal91, Bal93] 

Ensuring the transmission of voice or data of a given quality over the radio 
link is only half the problem in a cellular mobile network.  The fact that the 
geographical area covered by the network is divided into cells necessitates the 
implementation of a handover mechanism.  Also, the fact that the mobile can roam 
nationally and internationally in GSM requires that registration, authent-
ication, call-routing and location updating functions exist in the GSM network. 

The signalling protocol in GSM is structured in three layers [Rah93, Aud88], 
shown in Figure 3. Layer 1 is the physical layer, which uses the channel 
structures discussed above.  Layer 2 is the data link layer. Across the Um 
interface, the data link layer uses a slight modification of the LAPD
protocol used in ISDN, called LAPDm.  Across the A interface, the lower parts of 
Signalling System Number 7 are used.  Layer 3 is subdivided into 3 sublayers. 

Radio Resources Management
     	controls the setup, maintenance, and termination of radio channels 

Mobility Management
     	manages the location updating, handovers, and registration procedures, 
	discussed below 

Connection Management
     	handles general call control, similar to CCITT Recommendation Q.931, and 
	provides supplementary services. 

Signalling between the different entities in the network, such as between the 
HLR and VLR, is accomplished throughout the Mobile Application Part (MAP).  
Application parts are the top layer of Signalling System Number 7.  The 
specification of the MAP is complex. It is one of the longest documents in the 
GSM recommendations, said to be over 600 pages in length [Che91]. 

Described below are the main functions of the Mobility Management sublayer. 

5.1  Handover 

Handover, or handoff as it is called in North America, is the switching of an 
on-going call to a different channel or cell.  There are four different types of 
handover in the GSM system, which involve:
	* transferring a call between channels (time slots) in the same cell, 
* cells (Base Transceiver Stations) under the control of the same Base 
	Station Controller (BSC),	
* cells under the control of different BSCs, but belonging to the same 
	Mobile services Switching Center (MSC), and 
* cells under the control of different MSCs. 

The first two types of handover, called internal handovers, involve only one 
Base Station Controller (BSC).  To save signalling bandwidth, they are managed 
by the BSC without involving the Mobile service Switching Center (MSC), except 
to notify it at the completion of the handover.  The last two types of handover, 
called external handovers, are handled by the MSCs involved.  Note that call
control, such as provision of supplementary services and requests for further 
handoffs, is handled by the original MSC. 

Handovers can be initiated by either the mobile or the MSC (as a means of 
traffic load balancing). During its idle time slots, the mobile scans the 
Broadcast Control Channel of up to 16 neighboring cells, and forms a list of the 
six best candidates for possible handover, based on the received signal
strength.  This information is passed to the BSC and MSC, and is used by the 
handover algorithm. 

The algorithm for when a handover decision should be taken is not specified in 
the GSM recommendations.  There are two basic algorithms used, both closely tied 
in with power control. This is because the BSC usually does not know whether the 
poor signal quality is due to multipath fading or to the mobile having moved to 
another cell.  This is especially true in small urban cells. 

The 'minimum acceptable performance' algorithm [Bal91] gives precedence to power 
control over handover, so that when the signal degrades beyond a certain point, 
the power level of the mobile is increased.  If further power increases do not 
improve the signal, then a handover is considered. This is the simpler and more 
common method, but it creates 'smeared' cell boundaries when a mobile trans-
mitting at peak power goes some distance beyond its original cell boundaries 
into another cell. 

The 'power budget' method [Bal91] uses handover to try to maintain or improve a 
certain level of signal quality at the same or lower power level.  It thus gives 
precedence to handover over power control.  It avoids the 'smeared' cell 
boundary problem and reduces co-channel interference, but it is quite
complicated. 

5.2  Location updating and call routing 

References: [MJ94, Rah93, DS93] 

The MSC provides the interface between the GSM mobile network and the public 
fixed network. From the fixed network's point of view, the MSC is just another 
switching node. However, switching is a little more complicated in a mobile 
network since the MSC has to know where the mobile is currently roaming - and in 
GSM it could even be roaming in another country.  The way GSM accomplishes 
location updating and call routing to the mobile is by using two location 
registers: the Home Location Register (HLR) and the Visitor Location Register 
(VLR). 

The mobile initiates location updating when, by monitoring the Broadcast 
Control Channel, it notices that the location-area broadcast is not the same as 
the one previously stored in the mobile's memory.  An update request and the 
IMSI or previous TMSI is sent to the new VLR via the new MSC.  A Mobile Station 
Roaming Number (MSRN) is allocated and sent to the mobile's HLR (which always 
keeps the most current location) by the new VLR.  The MSRN is a regular 
telephone number that routes the call to the new VLR and is subsequently 
translated to the TMSI of the mobile.  The HLR sends back the necessary call-
control parameters, and also sends a cancel message to the old VLR, so that the 
previous MSRN can be reallocated.  Finally, a new TMSI is allocated and sent to 
the mobile, to identify it in future paging or call initiation requests. 


With the above location-updating procedure, call routing to a roaming mobile is 
easily performed. The most general case is shown in Figure 4 [Aud88], where a 
call from a fixed network (Public Switched Telecommunications Network or
Integrated Services Digital Network) is placed to a mobile subscriber.  Using 
the Mobile Subscriber's telephone number (MSISDN, the ISDN numbering plan 
specified in the ITU-T E.164 recommendation), the call is routed through the 
fixed land network to a gateway MSC for the GSM network (an MSC that interfaces 
with the fixed land network, thus requiring an echo canceller).  The gateway MSC 
uses the MSISDN to query the Home Location Register, which returns the current 
roaming number (MSRN).  The MSRN is used by the gateway MSC to route the call to 
the current MSC (which is usually coupled with the VLR). The VLR then converts 
the roaming number to the mobile's TMSI, and a paging call is broadcast by the 
cells under the control of the current BSC to inform the mobile. 

5.3  Authentication and security 

References: [DS93, FR93, LM92] 

Since the radio medium can be accessed by anyone, authentication of users to 
prove that they are who they claim to be, is a very important element of a 
mobile network.  Authentication involves two functional entities, the SIM card 
in the mobile, and the Authentication Center (AC).  Each subscriber is given a 
secret key, one copy of which is stored in the SIM card and the other in the 
Authentication Center.  During authentication, the AC generates a random number 
that it sends to the mobile.  Both the mobile and the AC then use the random 
number, in conjunction with the subscriber's secret key and a ciphering 
algorithm called A3, to generate a number that is sent back to the AC.  If the 
number sent by the mobile is the same as the one calculated by the AC, the
subscriber is authenticated. 

The above calculated number is also used, together with a TDMA frame number and 
Another ciphering algorithm called A5, to encipher the data sent over the radio 
link, preventing others from listening in.  Enciphering is an option for the 
very paranoid, since the signal is already coded, interleaved, and transmitted 
in a TDMA manner, thus providing protection from all but the most persistent and 
dedicated eavesdroppers. 

Another level of security is performed on the mobile equipment, as opposed to 
the mobile subscriber.  As mentioned earlier, each GSM terminal is identified by 
a unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.  A list of IMEIs 
in the network is stored in the Equipment Identity Register (EIR).  The status 
returned in response to an IMEI query to the EIR is one of the following: 

white-listed
     	The terminal is allowed to connect to the network 
grey-listed
     	Under observation from the network, possible problems 
black-listed
     	The terminal has either been reported as stolen, or it is not type 
approved (the correct type of terminal for a GSM network).  The terminal is not 
allowed to connect to the 
network. 

6  Conclusion and comments 

References: [Mal88] 

In this paper I have tried to give an overview of the GSM system.  As with any 
overview, and especially one covering a standard 8000 pages long, there are many 
details missing.  I believe, however, that I gave the general flavor of GSM and 
the philosophy behind its design.  It was a monumental task that the original 
GSM committee undertook, and one that has proven a success, showing that
international cooperation on such projects between academia, industry, and 
government can succeed.  It is a standard that ensures interoperability without 
stifling competition and innovation among suppliers, to the benefit of the 
public both in terms of cost and service quality.  For example, by using Very 
Large Scale Integration (VLSI) microprocessor technology, many of functions of 
the mobile station can be built in one chipset, resulting in lighter, smaller, 
and more energy-efficient terminals. 

Telecommunications are evolving towards personal communication networks, whose 
objective can be stated as the availability of all communication services 
anytime, anywhere, to anyone, by a single identity number and a pocketable 
communication terminal [Win93].  Having a multitude of incompatible systems 
throughout the world moves us farther away from, not closer to, this ideal. 
The economies of scale created by a unified system are enough to justify its 
implementation, not to mention the convenience to people of carrying just one 
communication terminal anywhere they go, regardless of national boundaries. 

The GSM system, and its twin system operating at 1800 MHz, called DCS1800, are a 
first approach at a true personal communication system.  The SIM card is a novel 
approach that implements personal mobility in addition to terminal mobility.  
Together with international roaming, and support for many other services such as 
data transfer, fax, Short Message Service, and supplementary services, in 
addition to telephony, GSM comes close to fulfilling the requirements for a 
personal communication system; close enough that it is being used as a basis for 
the next generation of communication technology in Europe. 

Another point where GSM has shown its commitment to openness, standards and 
interoperability is the compatibility with the Integrated Services Digital 
Network (ISDN) that is evolving in most industrialized countries, and Europe in 
particular (the so-called Euro-ISDN).  GSM is the first system to make extensive 
use of the Intelligent Networking concept in ISDN, in which services like
800 numbers are concentrated and handled from a few centralized service centers, 
instead of being distributed over every switching center in the country.  This 
is the concept behind the use of the various registers such as the HLR.  In 
addition, the signalling between these functional entities uses Signalling 
System Number 7, an international standard already used in many countries and 
specified for ISDN. 

GSM is a very complex standard, but that is probably the price that must be paid 
to achieve the level of integrated service and quality offered while subject to 
the fairly severe restrictions imposed by the radio environment. 

Common Standards

For some years, many countries throughout the world have offered 
mobile (cellular) services. The quality, capacity and area of coverage vary 
widely, but almost universally, demand has outstripped estimates. However, these 
are using a variety of technical standards. Indeed, some countries have offered 
a choice of network operators not always using the same technology. 

This diversity of standards was perhaps acceptable nationally, but is unhelpful 
when subscribers "roam" between countries. These roamers will drive their 
cars, fitted with mobile phones, or travel with their hand-held phones, and 
expect to be able to use them wherever they are. It is important to be able to 
receive calls as well as to make them, without special arrangements or 
additional subscription charges. This can only be achieved with phones made to 
operate to a common standard. 

The GSM initiative provides an infrastructure with the ability to use 
the phone throughout the world wherever its coverage is provided. Common 
standards throughout such a large market are important also for minimizing 
costs, to allow industry to manufacture to a common design of product for the 
whole world - an impressive market! So successful is GSM that many countries 
throughout the world have adopted the standard. The GSM standard is now being 
used not only in the original 900 MHz frequency band but also at 1800 MHz and 
now 1900 MHz in the USA. 

          ISDN

In the same time frame as the introduction of GSM, Telecom operators have also
been offering the new Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) to their
customers. This offers new standards of quality and performance with a very wide
range of services and GSM has been designed entirely in harmony with ISDN
principles and is totally compatible as far as is appropriate to the mobile
environment. Interworking between the two new standards ISDN and GSM is thus 
assured. 

          Digital technology

GSM is designed to use the latest Digital Technology for 
performance and reliability. Costs are minimized for such high-volume products 
since most of the complexity is compressed into the "VLSI chips" and the 
software. Digital technology today offers the best combination of performance 
and spectral efficiency, permitting more callers simultaneously to use the 
limited radio band available. 

          Spread of service

GSM is now a well established service and is available in all European countries
and many beyond. Many are already covering a substantial part of their country
with a good level of service. 

          Spread of frequency

The GSM standard has been adapted to operate also at 1800 MHz (called DCS1800) 
and at 1900 MHz (called PCS 1900). 

          The features of GSM

          Integrated voice/data

The primary function of GSM is to provide an excellent mobile telephony service.
Versions of all types of phone may also be used for a wide variety of new data
services without the use of a separate modem. These data services include the
GSM Messaging Service, Facsimile transmission and data communications to
nearly all the common standards, at rates up to 9600 bits/sec full duplex, much
faster than most existing mobile systems can support. 

As would be expected, phones are available in all the major configurations:
Vehicle, Portable and Hand-held, with a variety of prices and features. Roaming
with GSM networks throughout the world is fully automatic so long 
as your "home network" has an appropriate roaming agreement. Switch on in any 
area covered by GSM and your home network is notified where you are. Thus you 
will be able to receive calls, as well as make them, without your callers 
being aware that you are abroad. Phones must be Type Approved to ensure their 
suitability on all GSM networks. 

          Security

On GSM, your subscription is recorded in a Subscriber Card. This looks like a
normal size credit card (or it may be a much smaller card for use in hand-held
phones), but contains a complete microcomputer with memory on the SIM Card.
Just plug your Subscriber Card into a GSM phone, and the phone immediately
becomes "yours". The network checks that the subscription is valid and the card 
is not stolen, by AUTHENTICATING the call right back to your HOME 
database. 

This provides exceptional security, preventing false charges on 
your bill, and ensuring that incoming calls are correctly delivered. Security is 
also greatly enhanced by the use of FULL DIGITAL ENCRYPTION which is totally
effective against those wishing to listen into your conversations. This applies
equally for voice and for data calls. Other useful new features include the 
ability to store user information such as a list of short codes for dialing 
commonly-used numbers. 

          Performance

Whilst many of the current analogue systems can boast good performance, GSM has 
been designed to be as good as and often better than analogue systems.  Speech 
quality on GSM is comparable with analogue systems under 
average to good conditions. However, under poor conditions of weak signal or 
bad interference, GSM performs significantly better. Size, weight and 
battery life are also important parameters of performance. Due to the digital 
standards employed, a high level of silicon implementation is realized, leading 
to smaller, lighter phones as technology progresses. 

The data services can offer high performance with exceptionally low errors at
rates up to 9600 bits/sec, much faster than commonly available. No modems are 
required and you can connect your notebook computer to a suitable GSM phone 
either directly or via a simple adapter. The use of powerful automatic "sleep 
mode" makes a significant impact on battery life. Some hand-held phones may be 
expected to last well over a day between charges. 

          Services of GSM

The full list of services is extensive, and includes some of which are very 
innovative. Some of these services will not be available initially, and 
introduction may vary from network to network. 

          Telephony

Normal telephony is supported, with the ability to send or receive calls to a 
fixed or mobile subscriber throughout the world, using a standard "+" 
function for International Access Codes. 

          Emergency calls

Calls to the local emergency services can be made using a standardized
emergency number in any country, by dialing "112". 

          Supplementary services

GSM supports an extremely comprehensive list of supplementary services
including: 

                    Call Forwarding on... 
                    -Unconditional 
                    -Mobile Subscriber Busy 
                    -No Reply 
                    -Mobile Not Reachable 
                    Call Barring on... 
                    -Outgoing 
                    -Outgoing International 
                    -Outgoing International except to Home Country 
                    -Incoming 
                    -Incoming when roaming abroad 
                    Call waiting 
                    Call Hold 
                    Multi-Party Service 
                    Advice of Charge 
                    Calling line Identity 
                    Closed User Group 
The GSM standard is being actively extended and a number of attractive new 
services will be introduced in the next few years. 

          Data Services

GSM offers a very wide range of data services, which can be applied in a host of
different situations. Considerable effort has been made to simplify the method 
of use to encourage those inexperienceed in this field. It can also be seen that 
a very wide-ranging list of data services has been specified. Not all GSM 
Network Operators will offer all of them, at least not at first, but popularity 
and competition may determine which ones are made available. 

          Data Transmission

Data Transmission to a choice of popular standards may be sent or received, at 
all standard rates up to 9600 bits/sec. Examples include asynchronous data to a
standard modem or a packet switched network via a PAD. Similarly, synchronous
connection may be available to a modem, or directly to a packet switched 
network. 


In all these cases, no modem is required at the mobile - a suitable data 
terminal or lap top computer is connected directly to the mobile GSM phone - 
a great advance over previous systems, and much more convenient to use. When 
used in error correcting mode, extremely low data error rates are guaranteed, 
even under badly fading conditions. 

          Facsimile Group 3

Telefax messages may be sent to, or received from a standard Group 3 machine
anywhere in the world. Rates up to the Group 3 maximum of 9600 bits/sec are
supported, so a high speed service is available. 

          Connection to other data services

By using the data transmission described above, a wide range of 
services may be obtained. These include Electronic Mail - including the new 
X.400 standard access to international databases. 

          GSM Messaging (Short Message) Service

This service allows the transmission of messages up to 160 alphanumeric
characters to be sent to a GSM phone and displayed on the terminal. This can be
seen as an advanced form of paging, but has a number of advantages. If the phone
is switched off, or out of the area covered by GSM, the message is stored and 
offered to the subscriber when he reappears. This gives much greater confidence
that it has been received. 

Also, the user needs only one piece of equipment (the mobile phone), and the
caller needs to know only one number (the mobile phone number) for telephony
and messaging service. Some phones will be equipped for originating these
messages, but it is expected that telephony will typically be used to call an
operator who types in the message at a Service Centre. Access points will also 
be made available by some networks for messages to be originated via the 
internet or World Wide Web. 

          Cell Broadcast

This provides short messages to be sent to all phones in a geographical area. A
wide range of applications for this service can be envisaged, but typical
applications might include warnings of traffic delays or accidents. It works in 
a way somewhat similar to Teletext on television where you can select types of
message which may be of interest. 

Currently, you need the following equipment to enable GSM Data and Fax on your 
Notebook PC:

      A Notebook PC with a type 2 or 3 PC Card or Card Bus slot 
      A data-compatible GSM handset that supports 9.6 Kbps 
      A GSM Data Card that works with your handset 

 	Step 1: Selecting your Notebook PC 

Generally speaking, there are no special requirements for using GSM data, that 
restrict your choice from the vast offerings of notebook PCs. You are therefore 
free to make your selection based primarily on features such as price, perform- 
ance, brand preference, or which models are supported by your corporate IT. 
However, here are things to consider when making a purchase:

The notebook should include a PC Card (formerly called PCMCIA) or CardBus slot.
This is what enables you to use a GSM Data Card, and is a standard feature on 
most notebooks. The notebook should have Windows 95 installed, since this OS has 
special features designed for travelling professionals, such as Plug n' Play, 
OS-level modem support, Dial-Up Networking, and built-in fax support, that make 
it easier to connect to the Internet and send faxes. If the notebook is 
unavailable with Windows 95, then either consult with the manufacturer for its 
compatibility with Windows 95, or consider other models. If you would like to 
use Windows NT, you can, but will not presently benefit from Plug n' Play or OS-
level power-management support that is important for notebooks. 
      
Most major notebook manufacturers have already compatibility-tested their 
products with a number of GSM data cards, and in many cases either publish a 
"compatible" list or market GSM data cards under their own brand name. Look for 
notebook PCs that are offered bundled with a GSM data card and phone. This not 
only assures compatibility, but may offered a reduced price over the individual
components.

This article is focused more on the experienced phreaks out there who
might already know a little about AIN. If you don't, I'll try to explain as
best as I can. I made this article as simple as I could, but I have the
feeling that you beginners will have a little trouble, but maybe not. I
really don't have time to go into great detail, but I'll do the best I
can. Another thing, this article is about ain's basic architecture in
North America. If you live somewhere else, this information may differ a
Little, and even if you live in the U.S. it still may be a little off. If
you find anything wrong, please try to contact me so I can correct it.

=========================[ About AIN ]=========================

AIN products are currently deployed in multi-client networks in the U.S.,
Canada, Italy, Sweden, and probably a few other places. They are used in 
end offices, PBX's, and for service providers. If you have Bell Atlantic,
Pacific Bell, or Southwestern Bell in your area, you most likely have already
used it in some way or another without realizing it. The current AIN
product suite consists of:

-----[ ISCP - the ain service control point system, which includes:

SPACE System - service creation and provisioning system.

DRS - data and reports system that allows the phone company to collect
	service or customer-related data.

Data Distributor - enhances iscp software interoperability with existing
	operations and billing systems.

-----[ ISP - (intelligent services peripheral) allows PBX or network admin
to employ and control network functions.

With advanced intelligent networks, the service logic doesn't have to be
integrated into the switching system. Instead, it resides on a service
control point (SCP). Many switching systems on the network can access the
same SCP, thus they have access to the same source of service logic or
call data.

ISCP is not all one big package. It is made up of several software packages that 
are in the ISCP family. Also, it's not only used with ain. It can also be used 
by ETSI Core INAP (ETS 300 374-1 of the ETSI in CS-1 Core INAP) However, not all 
ISCP products are going to have the same requirements. It all depends what 
services they are running.

Just because the PBX has a special service, doesn't always mean its using AIN. 
Services like Definity Wireless PCS can operate outside ain or inside.

The SPACE system is used by whoever owns the network for creating new services. 
It provides end-to-end service development, testing and provisioning. It also 
includes red-line tracing and built in error-checking capabilities which allow 
the service provider to test service scenarios prior to provisioning them in 
their networks.

=========================[ Conclusion ]=========================

Well, I think that pretty much wraps it up. I know I probably left a lot of 
stuff out, and it may or may not be a little confusing. That's just the 
way it is.

The port information is this file is derived from the RFC standards.
If you liked this file send your comments to mastyoda@concentric.net.
If you hated this and thought it was stupid, send it to my dev/null. 
The info in the text is very useful to any hacker. Elite of not, everyone 
needs to port surf. Port Surfers will lover me for doing this.

=======================~* URL of the Month *~==================


After many hours of "surfing the web" I have determined that an excellent
learning resource center would have to the page headed by Alien_Phreak, an
Associate of the Linenoise Organization. Though I do not know Alien_Phreak 
personally, he seems to be one to be respectable. So this URL of the month 
goes to:
                       http:\\www.linenoise.org                           



Well, that's it for issue 2 of NPA. I hope you enjoyed it!  Please send ALL
spelling errors, gripes, compliments, and other comments on this issue to me
at CivilWarFreak@hotmail.com - I also like it when people send me articles :)
