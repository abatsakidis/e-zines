                          Current Events
    Voting Is Not Enough

    As the November 5th elections draw near, you will be inundated by
    countless people and organizations with pleas for you to "get out
    and vote" on election day.  You'll hear it from newspaper
    journalists.  You'll hear it from newscasters.  You'll hear it
    from the League of Women Voters.  You'll hear it from MTV.  You'll
    hear it from preachers.  And of course you'll hear it from the
    candidates themselves.  They will tell you that voting is both a
    right and a duty in this great democracy of ours.  They will tell
    you that this is the most important part of politics and will tell
    you to be proud of yourself for voting.

    I'll add my voice to the movement.  I encourage everyone to vote.
    Any participation in politics is better than none at all.

    But voting for candidates is the tiniest, least important part of
    politics.  Politics is far more than voting.  Politics is far more
    than even government.  Voting is nothing more than a "rubber
    stamp" of approval on a menu of choices and decisions that other
    people have already made for you.  If the political process
    delivers a menu of nothing but bad choices for you to choose from,
    voting doesn't matter much.

    As Plato put it:

    "One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is
    that you end up being governed by your inferiors."

    Judging by the choices we are offered in this year's elections,
    many would agree that we are paying the penalty for not
    participating enough in the political process.  And we should not
    delude ourselves into thinking otherwise just because we have
    "done our duty" by voting.

    How can common people, people who are not professional
    politicians, participate in politics in such a way that they can
    make real difference?

    First, we can set the agenda that politicians must respond to.  We
    can do this by never passing up an opportunity to speak up about
    the issues.  For some reason in the United States, it has become
    unseemly, or at least unfashionable, to discuss political issue in
    casual conversation with our friends and neighbors.  This has to
    change fast.

    Today, there are many ways for us to voice our opinions beyond our
    family and friends, if we would just use them.  We can join single
    interest issue groups.  Although lobbying organizations have a bad
    reputation these days, there is nothing inherently wrong with the
    concept of people rallying around an organization devoted to a
    single issue.  There are also many opportunities to speak for
    ourselves as individuals.  Call-in talk shows, letters to the
    editor of your local newspaper and magazines, and "viewer
    commentaries" on TV news casts are perfect vehicles for not only
    commenting on the current issues being discussed but also for
    raising issues that no one is yet talking about.  And as talk show
    hosts and newspaper editors will be quick to tell you, they hear
    from the same few people over and over again.  Make sure one of
    the people the politicians hear is you!

    Speaking out in public forums like newspapers and talk radio is
    effective because it reaches out to everyone in the audience.  And
    although elected officials follow these forums with great
    devotion, nothing beats contacting your representatives directly.
    Call them on the phone, write them a letter, send them a fax, send
    them e-mail.  If you don't know how to contact your
    representatives.  Find out.  If you don't know who your
    representatives are, you better find out quick because they are
    making decisions that affect you right now.

    In addition to speaking up for ourselves, we need to encourage
    diversity in the marketplace of ideas.  We need to become more
    vigilant about attempts to restrict public discussion and
    political participation.  The most visible example of this problem
    this year has been the Presidential debates, in which only two
    candidates were allowed on the debates despite the fact that there
    are no less than 6 candidates for President.  And the problem is
    much deeper than the debates.  Obstacles like ballot access laws,
    voter registration laws, campaign finance laws routinely block
    people from participating in the electoral process of the country.

    The next level of participation in politics, is to become a part
    of the government yourself.  Most people think of holding office
    as a full time career.  But political office can and should be a
    part time job, especially at the local level.  Think small.  Most
    towns have many different citizen review boards set up to make
    sure the general population has input into local government
    decisions.  Usually these are appointed positions and all you have
    to do is express an interest to your local representative to get
    appointed.

    Once in a position of this sort, you not only have a voice on the
    board's specific issue, you have an opportunity to speak out on a
    wide variety of issues because you will have much more direct
    access to the elected officials.  And you establish credibility
    with the people in your town which will be a big help if you
    should ever decide to run for an elected office.

    But the most important part of politics has nothing to do with
    government at all.  Politics is much bigger than government.  And
    the dirty little secret that politicians would rather not admit to
    is that they are followers, not leaders.  They can pass all the
    laws they want to address a problem, but none will be effective
    unless there are people willing to actually do the work.

    It is far better to volunteer time and money to your local food
    bank than it is to vote for a politician that promises "welfare
    reform."  It is far better to "adopt" an immigrant family and
    teach them English and how things work in the U.S.  than it is to
    vote for a politician that promises to "do something" about
    "illegal" immigrants.  It is far better to start a neighborhood
    watch and teach yourself how to responsibly and safely handle a
    gun than it is to vote for a politician that promises to "get
    tough on crime."  Selling cookies at a school's annual bake sale
    or volunteering a day of your time as a teacher assistant is much
    more effective way of helping a school than voting for a
    politician that promises to "improve education."

    Casting a vote is no substitute for actually working on a problem
    ourselves.

                      Cultural Phenomena
    Why We Need The Macarena

    It originated in Venezuela, 1993.  It spread like wildfire through
    Spain.  It has infiltrated most Spanish speaking countries in the
    world.  In 1995, it hit the shores of the United States.  You can
    find it in night clubs, retirement homes, high school gyms, and
    federal prisons.  It is discussed on MTV and talk shows.  It
    supports no less than three parasitical parodies.  It is still
    growing.  Women in Spanish speaking countries are naming their
    daughters after it.
 
    It is called "The Macarena".

    The Macarena is both a pop song and a dance craze.  The song, at
    least the most popular versions of the song, is a simple
    straight-forward pop tune.  It has a steady 4/4 beat suitable for
    dancing and a couple of verses followed by a minor key bridge
    which leads into the Big Finish.  It has a vaguely Latin feel to
    it, officially categorized by the Powers That Be as
    "Pop-Flamenco."  But mostly it's got that Universal Dance Hall
    style.  It's about 3 1/2 minutes long, more or less the perfect
    length for a commercial pop song.

    A typical verse from the Spanish lyrics of the original version of
    the song:

    Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
    Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria y cosa buena
    Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
    Ehhhhhh, Macarena!
    Macarena tiene un novio que se llama
    Que se llama de apellido Vitorino
    Y en la jura da bandera del muchacho
    Se la dio con dos amigos
    Macarena, Macarena, Macarena
    Que le gusta los veranos de Marbella
    Macarena, Macarena, Macarena
    Que le gusta la movida guerrilera
    Macarena suena con el Corte Ingles
    Y se compra los modelos mas modernos
    Le gustaria vivir in Nueva York
    Y ligar un novio nuevo

    which, translated into English, means:

    Give your body pleasure Macarena
    Because your body is for giving it pleasure
       and good things
    Give your body pleasure Macarena
    Ehhhhhhh, Macarena
    Macarena has a boyfriend whose name is
    Whose name is Vitorino
    And during his military swearing in
    She got together with two of his friends.
    Macarena, Macarena, Macarena,
    Who likes the summers of Marbella
    Macarena, Macarena, Macarena,
    Who likes the guerilla lifestyle
    Macarena dreams of the Cortes Ingles
         (a high class dept. store) 
    And she likes the most recent fashions
    She'd like to live in New York
    And trap a new boyfriend.

    It loses a little bit in the translation.  One wonders what is
    meant by "the guerilla lifestyle," especially considering her
    estranged boyfriend is in the military.  But obviously there's a
    corrupting dynamic at work in the relationship.

    The Americanized, "Bay Side Boys Mix" of the song has different,
    and much less clever, lyrics but a similar sentiment.

    Both versions of the song are about a beautiful women who is so
    full of life and life's pleasures that she can't help herself from
    dancing up a storm.  There are hints that it's vaguely sinful to
    get this much pleasure out of dancing.  It's about a woman who
    lives life too large for one man.  It's about a women who attracts
    men like moths to a flame.  And yet no one can find it in their
    heart to hold it against her.  It's an ancient, ancient archetype
    under a new name.

    Madonna better watch out.

    Safe, unoffensive lyrics with just a hint of lust.  An ancient
    archetype.  The perfect Commercial format.  All the necessary
    elements to turn this song into a Movement were there.  All it
    needed was a little push.  Well, a big push actually.

    The official public relations version of The Macarena's history
    goes like this:  Several years ago, Antonio Romero, one of the
    members of Los Del Rio, was staying in Caracas, Venezuela.  One
    night he was so inspired by watching an enthusiastic Flamenco
    dancer by the name of Diana Patricia that he rapped out an
    impromptu verse while she danced.  This verse later became the
    basis for the Macarena song.  Los Del Rio have been in the Spanish
    music scene since the 60's, publishing over 300 songs, mostly in
    the FlamencoPop genre.  And when Los Del Rio published the song in
    1993 through a regional Spanish record label, they had their first
    smash hit.

    But how did the Macarena make it from a regionally popular song to
    a world wide craze?  Enter into the picture Bertelsmann A.G., a
    major global publishing company which operates in nearly every
    industrial country in the world.  In the U.S.  They own media
    heavy weights like Bantam/DoubleDay/Dell publishers, and RCA,
    Arista, and many other record labels.  They also have TV and film
    production operations and are the European partners with America
    Online.

    Bertelsmann's mission is "to provide entertainment to the world
    and to be a home for creativity."  In 1994, BMG Entertainment's
    (as they are known in the US) Latin Division bought the record
    company that owned the rights to The Macarena and began putting
    the full force of their publishing and entertainment muscle behind
    it, promoting the song worldwide.  BMG targeted dance clubs with
    video screens and dance instructors so that club attendees could
    both see The Macarena dance in action and learn it from the club's
    instructors.  They introduced The Macarena into Mexico, Columbia,
    Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and several select American cities.  To
    account for cross cultural differences in various markets, Los Del
    Rio have recorded no less than 6 versions of the song.  This year,
    the Macarena had developed a strong enough following that Los Del
    Rio toured the United States promoting the "Bayside Boys Mix"
    version of the song, which culminated into breaking through into
    MTV's playlist.

    But even a major global publishing company like BMG can't push a
    song like The Macarena (and therefore can't sell records) unless
    it fills a need or a hole in the marketplace.  And that, I
    believe, is where The Macarena Dance fits into the picture.

    The dance itself is so simple anyone who can count to 16 can do
    it.  (See below.)  It is particularly susceptible to
    deconstruction.  The dance steps become absurd when you write them
    down.  But at just the right point in the dance, you get to do a
    little of that "shake your money maker" thing, thus ensuring its
    popularity.

    The two guys that make up Los Del Rio are pushing 50.  And if you
    have ever seen them, you know that they aren't exactly athletic
    superstars.  No backflips or flying leaps will be seen from these
    guys any time soon.  So if these guys can do The Macarena anyone
    can.  This is very important.  When a song can be danced to by
    retirees and Dance Divas alike, you've got a huge potential market
    on your hands.

    Every culture on the planet dances.  And until recently, dancing
    has always been a formalized ritual.  There have always been
    "steps" to it.  Whether you're talking about ballroom waltzes,
    Indian belly dances, the Achey-Brakey, or Contra line dances,
    dancing has always been a formal, ritualized means of physical
    expression.  It's only since the dawn of Rock music and all its
    descendent genres that dancing has gone to totally free-form
    movement.

    But let's face it.  The vast majority of us aren't comfortable
    enough with our bodies and how they move to improvise on a crowded
    dance floor.  We feel like bumbling idiots in these situations.
    People need ritualized dance steps to relieve us of this burden
    and make dancing fun again.  The Macarena Dance fills this need
    for millions of people worldwide.

    The fundamental ingredient that makes The Macarena such a
    successful craze is that people see these two middle aged
    anti-superstars with obviously unspectacular physiques having fun
    doing a simple dance with style and grace and dignity and they
    think to themselves, "Hey, I could do that, and it looks like
    fun."  And they do.  And it is.  And they buy records.  And they
    are happy.  And Los Del Rio are happy.  And BMG's worldwide
    marketing campaign is a huge success.  And the universal cultural
    phenomena of dancing is continued.

                          Current Events
    Lack of Advertising

    Sometimes the biggest stories in the newspaper aren't the most
    interesting ones.  Sometimes all it takes is a couple of sentences
    to convey worlds of information.

    Take for example the following newswire story published in the
    Raleigh News and Observer:

         Port Washington - Sixteen year old Jacob Kallas was
         arrested, cuffed, and jailed overnight because he didn't
         have the paperwork for his shots.

         Jacob's mother, Janet Kallas, admits she ignored two
         court orders to provide her son's new school with proof
         of immunizations, which he did receive.

         "I didn't realize we live in such a police state," she
         said.

    Seems that someone down at the Ad Council isn't doing their job
    very well.

                              True Story
    Pigs In A Blanket

    As a part-time social critic, it is my duty to always be on the
    lookout for incongruities in the social fabric of our culture.
    It's my job to ferret out inconsistency and expose it to the light
    of day for all to see.  Not as a muckraker, but as someone truly
    interested in seeing the improvement of American pop culture.  I
    offer insights and hopefully constructive criticism in kindest
    spirit, with nothing but society's best interests, with the
    sincere hopes that others will take my observations and put them
    to good use.

    But sometimes people just aren't ready to hear criticism.
    Sometimes they just aren't ready for change.  Sometimes even the
    sincerest criticism is not appreciated.  For example, 1:00 in the
    morning, sitting in an International House of Pancakes, is not
    exactly the best time to strike up a conversation with a waitress
    about linguistic mistakes on the menu.

    As is so often the case with me, I had to learn this the hard way.

    Every now and then I get a carbohydrate craving that can only be
    satisfied with a stack of pancakes and maybe a side order of
    hash-browns.  And when it hits, there's nothing else to do but
    head out to the local IHOP and feast.  Thank goodness they are
    open 24 hours a day.  So a few weeks ago, I found myself sitting
    in the IHOP in the middle of the night studying the menu.  My main
    task of course was to try to find a way to maximize the number of
    pancakes I could get for my money.  I was experimenting with
    various combinations of side orders and specials of the day and
    all-night breakfast deals.  But on a subconscious level, the
    social critic in my head was also studying the menu.  Noticing how
    it was laid out, how the descriptions of each item were
    instructive as well as appealing.  Well, it's just what we social
    critics do.  We can't stop doing it.

    One of the things I noticed about the IHOP menu, to its credit, is
    that the pictures on it are tasteful and inviting.  This is in
    sharp contrast to the Waffle House menu which apparently assumes
    that a large percentage of its customers can't read.  The Waffle
    House menu has big pictures of everything they offer plainly drawn
    out, like a diagram in a dictionary or a technical manual.  The
    obvious intent was to give people an opportunity to point to what
    they want.  But the IHOP menu pictures are more aesthetic, in an
    attempt to give you the impression of a warm, cozy restaurant.

    My eye wandered across an item on the menu called "Pigs in a
    blanket," which was described as a dish of four link sausages
    wrapped in a warm, buttermilk pancake.  Now like I said, my
    primary goal was maximize my pancake intake.  So at first this
    didn't seem to be such a good deal for my purposes.  While the
    sausage sounded OK, one pancake simply wasn't going to do.  But
    then I got to wondering, "how can they wrap four sausages in one
    pancake?"  Like I said, it was 1:00 a.m.  and I wasn't thinking
    quite as sharply as I usually do.  Of course they couldn't wrap
    four sausages in a single pancake.  They probably meant that each
    sausage was wrapped individually in its own, personalized,
    blanket.

    So the main faculties of my mind were satisfied and moved on to
    the rest of the menu.  But at this point the social critic in me
    woke up and said, "heyyyy, wait a minute.  How could this menu
    have been reworded so that there would be no confusion about what
    exactly IHOP was offering?"

    The problem with "Pigs in a blanket" is, of course, that the word
    pigs is plural while the word blanket is singular.  So the strict
    interpretation of the words would have to lead you to conclude
    that there is only one "blanket," i.e.  pancake, involved.  Ones'
    first inclination would be to rename the dish "pigs in blankets"
    so that it would be clear that there are multiple pancakes
    involved.

    Better, but something about this solution still bothered my inner
    social critic.  About then the waitress came over to take my
    order, so I asked her, "What exactly comes with pigs in a blanket.
    Does it come with just one pancake?"

    "Oh no," she said, "four pancakes and four link sausages."

    I paused a few seconds to absorb and analyze this new information.
    The waitress, bless her heart, waited.

    "Well, how does it work?"  I asked, "do you lay all the pigs down
    together and then cover them all up with the four pancakes?  Or is
    each pig wrapped individually with its own pancake so that there
    is a one to one association between each pancake and each pig?"

    She looked at me.  Politely.

    "Each one is individually wrapped."

    I had to think about this some more.  How could you rename this
    dish so that this was clear?

    "But I can ask the cook to rearrange them if you like," she
    offered, "Does it really matter?"

    "Ummmm," I replied.  "I guess not."

    "Good then," she said, "Pigs in a blanket coming up."

    And off she went.  I hadn't actually intended to order that.  I
    was just curious.  But I didn't have the heart to bother her
    anymore.

    While I was waiting for my "Pigs in a blanket" to arrive, I
    couldn't stop thinking about this.  I still wasn't satisfied.  And
    I kept thinking about the question the waitress asked me, "Does it
    really matter?"  Something about the tone of her voice when she
    said that kept coming back to me.

    No, it doesn't matter how the dish is constructed.  At least not
    in terms of what you get for your money.  Whether those link
    sausages are huddled together at the bottom of my plate under a
    stack of 4 pancakes or whether they are "individually wrapped"
    really doesn't matter that much.

    And then it hit me.  But the name of the dish _implies_ that it
    matters.  What's needed is a name for the dish that makes the
    blanket part subservient to the pig part so that it doesn't raise
    these issues at all.  And that's when I had my brilliant insight.
    When the waitress came back with my meal, I was ready.

    As she was putting down my plate, I said to her, "Ya know, I think
    this dish should be called `Pigs blanketed' so that there's no
    implication about how the plate is arranged.  Like you said, it
    doesn't really matter."

    "What?"  she asked.

    "You know, like `attorneys general.'  You don't say `attorney
    generals' or `attorneys generals' You say `attorneys general'.
    The `general' is a descriptive word that modifies the main word
    `attorney'.  So `pigs blanketed' would do the same thing.  It
    would avoid confusion."

    "Enjoy your meal sir."

    Maybe she was just really busy that night.
