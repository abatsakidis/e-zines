    Darwin Award 1995
    
    Earlier this year, the Arizona Highway Patrol discovered a pile of
    smouldering metal smashed into the side of a mountain at the apex
    of a curve in a highway.  At first they thought it was the
    wreckage of a small airplane, but later decided it was a car,
    though they couldn't determine what sort of car it was because the
    car was mangled so badly.
                                           
    But during their investigation the story began to come out.  It
    seems that a man had somehow managed to get his hands on a
    solid-fuel rocket used to give heavy military transport planes an
    extra boost during take-off.  This fellow had driven his Chevy
    Impala out into the middle of the desert on a long straight road,
    attached the rocket to the roof of his car, ignited the rocket,
    and literally taken off.

    Investigators estimate that the Chevy Impala reached a speed of
    about 250-300 miles per hour.  Now that's a joy ride!

    Unfortunately, these solid-fuel rockets don't turn off once you
    ignite them; and straight roads don't run on forever.  You can
    just imagine this man's range of emotions during his escapade.
    First the exhilaration, then the slight worry once he realized
    that he hadn't planned on how to turn off the rocket,.  Next,
    panic when the brakes burned up followed by sheer terror when he
    saw the curve up ahead.

    According to news circulating on the Internet, this man has been
    nominated for this year's Darwin Award.  This award is an annual
    honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest
    service by killing himself in the most spectacular way.  (Last
    year's award was given to a man who killed himself when he tipped
    a Coke machine over on himself while trying to steal himself a
    free soda.)

    But ya know, I kinda gotta admire the guy for going after the
    thrill.

    =================== 
    Bold New Initiative
                 
    As the deadline for The Junto #29 approaches, the President has
    just announced a bold new initiative to transform the world as we
    know it, or it least score himself some cheap ratings points for
    the next election.  He has announced that smoking is bad and the
    FDA should have authority to regulate the sale and distribution of
    tobacco just like any other drug.  And in a brilliant campaign
    strategy move, he chose to announce this bold new initiative in
    the heart of tobacco country, North Carolina.  Our Democratic
    Governor was not amused.

    How insightful our President is.  How in tune he is with the
    times.  Congress is bothering with mundane issues like how the
    heck we are ever going to balance the budget and what we can do to
    keep the Medicare system from going bankrupt.  Those
    head-in-the-clouds politicians in Washington are holding hearings
    on the Waco massacre, which could arguably be the worst abuse of
    government power in recent history.  Those out of touch rascals we
    call representatives are wasting their time figuring out what to
    do about the Bosnian civil war.  What are these folks thinking?  I
    suppose the President will expect them all to set these issue
    aside and join him in a united, bipartisan war against tobacco.

    I guess after trying to sell the nation on gays in the military,
    Nationalizing the health care industry, the invasion of Haiti that
    wasn't called an invasion, establishing diplomatic relations with
    Viet Nam, the 50 billion dollar Bailout of the Mexican government,
    the Bosnian arms embargo, the President felt like he had to do
    Something.  Anything.  Anything at all to show that he is worthy
    of leading the nation.

    And yet, somehow, I think the President missed the boat on this
    one.  Despite his tobacco proposal being overwhelmingly popular, I
    think he has proven just how ineffective and out of touch he is.
    I mean, is this the best he can do?

    =================================================
    Hit `em Again! Hit `em Again!  Har-der!  Har-der!

    The AP News service reports that a long time fugitive by the name
    of Nick George Montos, who has the distinction of being the first
    man to ever be on the FBI's 10 most wanted list twice and who has
    been running from the law for nine years, has been apprehended by
    a 73 year old antique shop owner by the name of Sonia Paine.

    It seems that Mr.  Montos had tied up Ms.  Paine and was robbing
    her store.  But she was able to break free and the two got into a
    fighting match.  Mr.  Montos had managed to hit Ms.  Paine with a
    baseball bat and spray her with mace before she really got mad and
    wrestled the bat away from him and returned the slugs.  "I don't
    take any crap from anybody," Ms.  Paine said, "I beat the hell out
    of him."

    And a good thing, too.

    ====================================== 
    The Politicization Of Medical Research
                    
    Once again, Senator Jesse Helms has managed to offend the
    sensibilities of many citizens by merely stating the obvious.  One
    might wonder if he is running for reelection.  In a recent
    interview with the New York

    Times, Helms called for a reduction in federal research money
    earmarked for AIDS research for two reasons.  First, he cites
    figures that indicate that AIDS is only the ninth leading cause of
    death in the United States, yet more federal money is spent on
    AIDS research than other research programs for more deadly
    illnesses.  Second, he calls for a reduction in federal research
    money because the disease is primarily spread by homosexuals
    engaging in "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct."
                                           
    There's little doubt that Senator Helms can back up his claims of
    disproportionate AIDS research funding with accurate government
    figures.  Others have made similar claims in the past.  And yet
    critics of Senator Helms can almost certainly cite different
    government figures that show fair and equitable funding with equal
    accuracy, thanks to the myriad of government programs involved and
    the labyrinthine ways that the government does its bookkeeping.

    Besides, many people will be quick to point out that, ideally,
    federal research money should not be a "quota" program in which
    money is doled out to various fields of research in proportion to
    their "importance."  Each area of research should receive the
    funds it needs to do through, prudent, yet efficient research.
    It's sad and unsettling to think of various fields of medical
    research being pitted against each other in a morbid battle for
    funds.

    But that's the way it is.  When one strips away the emotional
    rhetoric, Helms is correct in pointing out that federal research
    money is doled according to the political weights exercised by
    various lobbying efforts and special interest groups rather than
    any sort of noble evaluation of need or merit.  Even setting up a
    panel of scientists to set spending priorities on research
    programs rather than by politicians, as some have suggested,
    simply shifts the politicization to the selection of the panel.
    He who gets to choose who's on the panel more or less gets to
    determine how the funding will be doled out.  Distribution of
    federal money will always be politicized.  It's always been that
    way.  Everyone knows it.  Welcome to the world of politics.

    And while lamenting about the politicization of AIDS research
    funding, Helms is also engaging in political pandering of his own
    by trying to imply that funding AIDS research is a tacit approval
    of "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct."  Such rhetoric
    plays well with some of Senator Helms' constituents but one can
    use the same reasoning to justify cutting just about any other
    federal research one cares to.
                                           
    For example, there are millions of people in the country, many of
    whom live in Senator Helms own district, who regard smoking as
    ``deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct'', yet we don't hear
    Senator Helms calling for an end to lung cancer research.  Nor do
    we hear him advocating the abolition of federal price support
    programs for tobacco.  Indeed, he is among the staunchest
    defenders of federal tobacco programs.

    Compassion for a human being's suffering is sometimes independent
    of one's approval or disapproval of that person.  One may feel
    compassion for someone suffering with AIDS while disapproving of
    his homosexual life-style that put him at risk.  One may feel
    compassion for a lung cancer patient while disapproving of the
    fact that he smokes.  So why is Helms campaigning for reductions
    in AIDS research but not lung cancer research?  Politics.  Pure
    and simple.

    One would like to imagine a world in which medical research was
    de-politicized, a world in which scientists did not have their
    agendas set by politicians pandering to their home constituency.
    The first step toward de-politicized medical research is to phase
    out federal funding entirely and to create tax incentives that
    favor and encourage medical research through independent,
    non-governmental institutions.  Medical research will only become
    de-politicized when it is funded by charitable organizations and
    compassionate individuals and politicians like Senator Helms are
    bypassed entirely.

    ===================
    The Net:  The Movie
                  
    It seems that cyberspace is the hip place to make a movie these
    days.  There is Johnny Mnemonic, Virtuosity, the not yet released
    Strange Days, and The Net.

    So last weekend I trouped off to the local mid-night movie house
    to watch The Net.  I figured that if nothing else, it had Sandra
    Bullock in it.  As it turns out, Sandra Bullock is just about the
    only thing in the movie worthwhile.  She's currently enjoying her
    15 minutes of fame as the sexiest woman in American pop culture,
    and deservedly so.  It's been too long since the
    girl-next-door-whose-femininity-shines-through-despite-no
    -attempts-to-emphasize-it brand of sexy has been fashionable and I
    for one am glad to see its return.  But I still think Daisy
    Fuentes is the highest embodiment of that style, but I like Sandra
    Bullock also.

    But I digress.  The Net has a thoroughly unremarkable plot.
    Typical summer chase thriller.  Some chase scenes in visually
    interesting places.  A hint of sex, though not flagrant or
    gratuitous.  Some good beat up on the bad guy shots complete with
    a fire extinguisher across the jaw scene.  But there is nothing
    you haven't seen a jillion times before.

    Almost.  There are a couple of redeeming things about this movie.
    First, it has Sandra Bullock in it and she does a good job playing
    a computer geek.  She had all the mannerisms down pretty well.
    The crossed arms, not looking at people in the eye, the nervous,
    stuttering manner of speaking.  Of course all the computer geeks I
    know are slovenly, pasty guys and Sandra Bullock is trim,
    good-looking and very female.  Dennis Miller also has a small role
    as Sandra Bullock's obnoxious, self-centered,
    ex-lover/psyichiatrist (oh these complicated `90s).  He does a
    good job at it, but then such a role comes naturally for Dennis
    Miller.
                                           
    But the other redeeming quality in this movie is that the
    techno-babble is amazingly accurate, for a movie.  It appears that
    the screen writers paid a lot of attention to detail when dealing
    with the Net itself.
                                           
    They did have to invoke poetic license in a number of areas.  For
    one thing, The Net even during the best of times under the best of
    circumstances is not nearly as fast as was prtrayed in the movie.
    Also, they showed a lot of things visually that weren't
    necessarily visualized.  For example when a virus trashes your
    computer, the screen doesn't necessarily melt away into garbage.
    It is more likely to just go blank.

    But those are minor transgressions.  From what I understand about
    how the Internet is set up and how it's underlying protocols,
    TCP/ip, work, the movie showed Sandra Bullock's sleuthing on the
    net pretty darn accurately.  There's one scene where she's trying
    to access a site on the internet but trying to hide where she's
    dialing in from and it shows how she does that using the same
    technique that that East German spy ring was using to get into
    military computers a couple of years ago.  Also there's a scene in
    which she's trying to track down someone else's location on the
    internet and it appeared she was doing all the steps a person
    would have to go through to really do this on the internet.  Also
    the online chats seemed realistic, even down to the slang.  (Many
    techno movies put _too_much_ slang into characters'
    conversations).
                                           
    I also liked the way the bad guys operated in this movie.  The bad
    guys are the Praetorians and the are wreaking havoc all over the
    globe in order to get people to use a software security package
    that their front company sells.  The security package, called
    GateKeeper supposedly protects computers on the Internet from
    unauthorized intrusions, but it secretly has a way to let the
    Praetorians into the computer.  This giving the bad guys access to
    hundreds of Very Important Computers all over the world.  But they
    have to get people to install the GateKeeper software in the first
    place so they create panics in whihc, of course, the only
    computers unaffected are the ones guarded by the GateKeeper
    software.

    There were several other unrealistic bits in the movie, all of
    which can be explained away by poetic license.  For example, the
    movie's premise is based on the notion that all these Very
    Important Computers, like the New York Stock Exchange and the
    Federal Reserve are on the Internet.  But of course in real life
    they aren't, for the obvious security reasons.  But the only
    glaring inaccuracy that I couldn't excuse was in the movie's
    climatic scene in which Sandra Bullock destroys all of the
    Praetorian's work by running a PC virus on a mainframe computer.

    This just doesn't work.  `Mainframe' is a vague, over used, over
    generalized term that can mean just about anything.  But usually
    the term mainframe refers to computers built according to IBM's
    system 360 or System 390 architecture.  These beasts are the work
    horses of big business and are the best there is at efficiently
    slogging through all the junk that companies have to get done on a
    computer.  But they do not, can not run PC software.  So there was
    no way Sandra Bullock could have brought down the mainframe with
    her PC virus program.

    Still, I'd say it was worth seeing, though you might wait for it
    to come out at the $1 movies.

    A Sentence or Two About Paragraph
                     
    I subscribe to quite a few small magazines and if one were to
    judge magazines strictly in terms of how much they cost per word,
    Paragraph magazine would easily be the worst magazine I get.  But
    it's actually one of the best and one of my favorites.

    Paragraph magazine is, surprise, a magazine of paragraphs.  That
    is to say, there are no essays, stories, poems, or pictures in
    this publications.  The whole zine is a 4 inch square booklet
    consisting of 30 or 40 pages.  On each page is a single paragraph
    written by a different author.  They're sort of like short stories
    on steroids.  I'm constantly amazed at how much whallop a good
    author can pack into a single paragraph.
                                           
    Single issues are $4.00, but you can get a three issue
    subscription for $10.00.  The magazine comes out once per quarter
    I believe.  Paragraph Magazine can be ordered by writing to
    editors Walker Rumble and Karen Donovan at 18 Beach Point Drive,
    East Providence, RI 02915.

    My First Record
                                             
    I can't exactly remember explicitly the first record I ever
    bought.  I can however remember the first record I ever owned.

    This was in 1977 or 1978.  I was living with my family in Corpus
    Christi Texas at the time.  I was in 7th grade, if I remember
    right.  Now at the junior high school I went to that year, you
    were allowed to like one of three bands.  AC/DC, KISS, or
    Aerosmith.  Why?  I don't know.  That's just the way it was back
    then.  It's like there was an unwritten law that had been passed
    someplace.

    But I had begun listening to the radio before I went to sleep at
    night, secretly.  Why did I have to do it secretly?  Were my
    parents monsters or something?  No not at all.  I'm sure they
    wouldn't have minded.  So I don't know why I felt the need to keep
    it a secret.  Anyway, I had this little pocket AM/FM radio, it was
    about the size of a large deck of card.  And I would tune it into
    the local rock'n'roll radio station put it under my pillow.  And
    I'd lay very quietly and listen to the songs.  I had to be very
    still be cause if moved my head too much, it would turn the tuning
    dial on the radio and lose the station.

    One of the big deals in Corpus Christi is that they have a Naval
    Air Station there, a big one.  And as I understand it, it is used
    to do a lot of the Navy's pilot training.  All I know is that
    almost every night, there was a steady stream of planes flying
    over the area.  It seemed like they were flying right over our
    house.  And if I held my head just right, I could see out the
    window in my bedroom and watch the planes fly across the sky while
    I listened to the radio.

    Imagine the perfect music to go with that scenario.  Late night,
    dark, dreamy, flying music.

    One night I heard it.  It was the Steve Miller Band.  The song was
    "Fly Like An Eagle" off the album by the same name.  I don't know
    if the album had just come out or if it was just the first time I
    ever heard it.  But at the time I thought it was the coolest song
    I had ever heard in my life.  So somehow I got it.  It was
    probably a birthday present, but I can't remember.  I do remember
    playing it for the first time and discovering that the whole album
    is like some sort of cosmic trip on a spaceship and the various
    songs are like new worlds being discovered on the way.

    Of course I carefully concealed this musical aberration of mine
    from my friends since it wasn't one of the approved listening
    choices in our junior high.  But I still own that album and every
    now and then I haul it out and play it.  And yes, I still think
    it's one of the coolest albums I've ever heard.
