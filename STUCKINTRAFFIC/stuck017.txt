    ===================================
                         Current Events
    Check Your Bags?

    In the aftermath of the TWA disaster, which at this point is looking
    more and more like sabotage, the President has been making proposals
    right and left about how best to fight terrorism in the United
    States.  One may question why the President makes these proposals
    now, while the country is collectively panicked rather than after
    we've had a chance to calm down, but it's a moot question.  The
    proposals are out there now, legislators are debating them.  So we
    better be thinking about them also.

    The proposal that seems most reasonable, and most likely to be
    enacted, is increasing security measures used to screen passengers
    and luggage at airports.  The current search procedures at airports
    in the United States seem to be minimally prudent without being too
    invasive.  Checked luggage is subject to being searched but in
    practice it rarely is.  Airline workers who check baggage make a
    modest attempt to ensure that they only check luggage that clearly
    belongs to a passenger on a flight.  Before entering boarding areas,
    everyone has to pass through metal detectors and have their carry on
    items scanned via X-Ray.

    The Clinton Administration is proposing that people be required to
    show picture identification when checking in for a flight and
    checking their luggage.  The Administration is also proposing that
    there be a large increase in the numbers of bags that are randomly
    searched as a means of discouraging anyone from planting explosives
    in checked luggage.  The searches as people enter the boarding areas
    of airports would also be more thorough.  Finally, the
    administration wants to require thorough "background checks" of all
    people who work with airline baggage and air cargo.

    The strategy here is simple and straight forward.  But is it worth
    doing?  Proposals like these always have to be weighed against the
    inconvenience, the invasion of privacy, and the expense.  Since
    these proposals have to be implemented by the airlines and the
    airport authorities, the cost of them is passed on to the travelers
    in increased ticket prices and airport usage fees.  How much more
    are we willing to spend?  Let's set aside the thorny issues of
    balancing government power against the Bill of Rights and take the
    government out of the picture all together for a moment.

    Suppose an airline started a new program in which they start hand
    searching every piece of luggage loaded on to the plane and
    carefully searching every person boarding the plane.  Not only will
    this reduce the chances of the flights falling victim to terrorist
    acts to practically none, it will also reduce the risks of dangerous
    things being brought onto the plane, like those that cause the
    ValuJet crash.  But their operating costs will also be much higher
    so their ticket prices will be higher than competing airlines.  How
    much are you willing to pay for this added security?  How much
    earlier are you willing to arrive at the airport?  How much are you
    going to mind if people rummage through all your belongings?  Would
    this airline's program give it a competitive advantage?  Or would it
    go out of business?

    Ultimately these three sorts of "costs" have to be weighed against
    the perceived likelihood that the flight will fall victim to
    terrorism and/or that dangerous items will be inadvertently brought
    on board.

    In times of crisis, like after the TWA disaster and after the
    ValuJet crash, we have a tendency to disregard issues of cost and
    focus on the problem.  No one wants to appear uncaring or
    unresponsive.  If we fail at a task, it's at least not for lack of
    trying to address the problem.  Inaction is one of the gravest sins
    in our society, even worse than ignorance.  And while this may be
    one of our greatest strengths, those disregarded costs usually come
    back to haunt us.  This country's mind boggling debt is testament
    to the dangers of disregarded costs.  So while we discuss what needs
    to be done to restore our faith in the safety of air travel, it is
    important for us to keep in mind what we will be giving up compared
    to what we gain.

                         Current Events
    Olympic Park Terrorist Caught?
                         by David Price

    Imagine, if you will, if the current line of media speculation about
    the Olympic Park bombing in fact proves correct:

    An overweight Barney Fyffe gets fired from Mayberry and goes to work
    in Security for a small private school in the same county.  He gets
    fired from the school for being "overenthusiastic" in his
    investigations.

    This bully, who wants to be a hero in the worst way, gets himself
    hired as part of the most ballyhooed, most expensive,
    highest-profile, and highest-tech security group in history.

    He's almost there; he's in there with the NSA, CIA, FBI, BATF,
    Georgia Bureau of Investigations, Georgia State Patrol, Atlanta
    Police Department, Fulton County Police, and a host of other
    like-minded types from a host of other organizations.

    He's one of them, but he waits a week and still gets no chance to be
    a hero.  He decides to make his own break.  He plants a bomb with at
    least a 30-minute delay, then "spots" it, and begins to try to
    evacuate people from the area.  He figures he's got time.  An
    accomplice calls 911, and Barney figures the bomb squad will be
    there in a couple of minutes.  He will have saved everybody, and
    will be a hero.

    The most ballyhooed, most expensive, highest-profile, and
    highest-tech security group in the world takes 10 minutes to even
    notify the local police department because the 911 operator can't
    find a street address for Centennial Olympic Park.  It's only one of
    the largest and most publicized pieces of real estate in the entire
    City of Atlanta.  Anybody left alive inthe city who doesn't know
    where it is has been in a coma for the last 3 years.

    When Atlanta's finest finally get the word, they dispatch a squad to
    a telephone booth 2 blocks away from the threatened site.

    It takes another 20 minutes for someone to notify the bomb squad.
    Nobody ever notifies the rent-a-cops inside the park.

    Of course, by then, the bomb has gone off 12 minutes early because
    Barney didn't set the timer correctly, and 2 innocent people have
    died.

    Now, help me understand this ...  President Clinton is going to use
    this as part of his excuse to further destroy our Constitutional
    liberties.  He's also going to ask for more of our tax money to
    authorize many of these same klutzes to "protect" us against one
    klutz who can't even make it as a Sheriff's Deputy in a small
    Southern county?

                     Cultural Phenomena
    Why Are These Men Running?

    Each year, thousands and thousands of people from around the world
    gather in the town of Pamplona, Spain to celebrate the Festival of
    San Fermin.  Like most festivals, the Festival of San Fermin is a
    yearly showcase for local musicians, artists, and entertainers.
    But mostly it's a ten day long party.  Basements that are normally
    used for warehouses, are turned into bars to handle the crowds.
    They're open all night.  The streets are packed, filled with people
    milling around.  Nationalities are blurred by good will, alcohol,
    and lack of sleep.  But the highlight of the Festival of San Fermin,
    the main reason people gather there is for the daily "El Encierro,"
    the bull runs.

    These bull runs, made famous by Earnest Hemmingway, are a 600 year
    old tradition in Pamplona.  Each day during the festival, the bulls
    that will be in the afternoon's bull fights are released from the
    ramparts at the edge of the city's ancient fortress walls and run
    through a narrow winding course through the streets of the oldest
    part of town and into the bull ring where they are then corralled.
    Groups of people, mostly young men, the "mozos," run through the
    narrow streets with the bulls.  The course is narrow, with many
    sharp turns and steep grades, and at the end it funnels the bulls
    and runners through a narrow tunnel into the bull ring, where
    thousands of spectators gather to watch the mozos and the bulls
    enter the ring.

    Although there are experienced bull handlers running along with the
    bulls, they are completely loose and have their own free will within
    the confines of the course.  No one knows what the bulls will or
    won't do.  If a bull is in a foul mood, there is nothing to stop it
    from charging a nearby runner.  Traditionalists dress in white for
    the bull runs and wear red ribbons and sashes to further tempt the
    bulls into noticing them.  And even if the bulls remain relatively
    calm and don't charge anyone, they pose a serious threat to the
    runners.  If runners stumble and fall over each other in the
    streets, the bulls aren't very likely to stand by docilely waiting
    for the path to clear.  Bulls, as a general rule, like to build up
    momentum and run through whatever is in their way.

    Once the bulls have run their course and made it into the bull ring,
    specially trained bull handlers are charged with the job of
    corralling the bulls into pens, but usually not before the bulls get
    to take out their frustrations at the bewildering experience by
    charging the crowds milling about in the ring at least once.  (Bull
    running tip:  Carry a rolled up newspaper with you.  If a bull
    charges you run away as fast as you can while waving the paper out
    to your side.  Supposedly the bulls aim for the where they see the
    most commotion.)

    Though not as famous as the Pamplona bull runs, similar rituals are
    held in just about every Spanish town.  In the town of Toro they
    place a bucket of wine in the center of the bullring, and only the
    bravest will venture into the ring with the bulls for a quick drink
    of wine.  In the town of Carbajales they let 3 bulls out into the
    countryside and the people of the town have to find some way to
    round them up.

    But why?

    According to the Catholics of the region, Saint Fermin was martyred
    in Pamplona by being dragged through the streets by raging bulls.
    And ever since then, according to Catholic belief, the "hand of San
    Fermin" protects the runners from the bulls' wrath.  So to the
    traditionalists, the Pamplona bull run is an act of faith.  From
    that beginning, the bull runs evolved over the centuries into a rite
    of passage.  It is said that in past centuries no self-respecting
    woman in Pamplona would marry a man who had never run with the
    bulls.  Today women aren't nearly so demanding.  But the annual bull
    runs attract thrill seekers from around the world, even women, much
    to the consternation of the local townspeople.

    An act of faith, a rite of passage, a big thrill.  Like any
    tradition that survives 600 years, there are multiple reasons why
    people participate.  But the element common to everyone that runs
    with the bulls is the desire to face danger.  Whether the
    participants are there to test their faith, win a girl's heart, or
    get a big adrenaline rush, every single participant chooses to face
    the bulls' unpredictable, brutal nature.

    John Vinas has run with the bulls every year since he was 17, as he
    puts it, "With the running of the bulls there is an incredible
    amount of tension and excitement.  If the bulls don't get you the
    crowd will.  Events spin out of your control.  You cannot determine
    the speed of the bulls or whether they are out to get you.  The
    streets are so crowded with people, you never know if the guy in
    front of you will trip you up.  There is a constant feeling that any
    miscue can cause serious injury or even death."

    And it has.  Hardly a year goes by in which at least one person is
    not injured enough to be hospitalized.  People have died in the bull
    runs.  The most recent death occurred during the 1995 bull runs when
    American Matthew Peter Tassio bled to death minutes after being
    gored.  The fact that emergency medical staff are standing by
    doesn't lessen the danger.

    But thousands and thousands of people travel to Pamplona to
    participate every year.  Anyone who wants to run with the bulls can.
    There are no officials of any sort there to make sure you are
    qualified to be on the streets with the bulls.  There are no release
    forms to sign.  There are no qualifications.  There is plenty of
    opportunity for participants to change their mind about running, but
    no one is turned away.  When you enter the streets at Pamplona's
    Rochapea Rampart, where the runs begin, you are taking your life
    into your own hands.  You and you alone are responsible for your
    life during the 850 meter run.

    But why?  Why tempt fate?  Why tempt God?  Why tempt Nature?

    The reason has little to do with success of failure in the bull run.
    Those who are injured in the run suffer no less honor than those
    that aren't.  In fact friends and family of injured runners wear the
    spilled "amigo blood" on their cheeks as a tribute to the runner's
    bravery.  No, it's not the end result of the run that's important,
    but the run itself.

    The adrenaline rush is a human necessity, not a frill.  Human beings
    need to know that they can handle the pressure when "events spin out
    of control."  And when we have become so civilized that these needs
    aren't fulfilled, our culture invents ways to get them.  Whether
    it's running with the bulls, or jumping in a mosh pit, or starting a
    revolution, or whatever; even if it's on a more humble scale, like
    excelling at a sport, or venturing out on a crowded urban street at
    night; even if there's no "rational" reason for it, like not wearing
    motorcycle helmets or seatbelts; taking chances and facing danger
    are a fundamental part of being human that can't be denied.

    So the questions we ask ourselves should not be, "Why are these men
    running with the bulls?"  but "What sort of person would want to
    stop them?"

                     Cultural Phenomena
    Teamwork vs Working as a Team

    Not too long ago, I was at out local airport to help some friends
    out by picking them up and driving them home; and while I was
    waiting for their plane to arrive, I learned a great lesson about
    teamwork.

    Our local airport is the Raleigh-Durham International.  RDU isn't
    the largest airport on the planet earth.  It's just big enough to
    have aspirations of developing into a big airport someday.  The
    terminals are always under construction and constantly being
    revamped to remove any traces of local identity and give it that
    big, universal bland look that all the big airports have.  In the
    terminal that my friends' flight was arriving at, there was so much
    construction and such that the "gates" were right there on the
    tarmac with the planes, If it weren't for the walls of glass, you
    could almost reach out and touch the planes.  I really enjoyed this
    because I got to watch the plane arrival and the plane's attending
    crew.  .

    As the plane rolled in, there was a crew of 5 waiting.  I don't know
    the official titles for each of these people's jobs, but I'll call
    them the baggage handler, the parker, the greeter, and the two
    cleaners.  Everyone has their particular spot to stand.  The parker
    stands right where the pilot is supposed to point the nose of the
    plane.  The baggage guy sits on the baggage tractor off to the left,
    about 20 yards away.  The greeter stands by the controls of that
    mobile hallway thingy that connects to the plane's door.  And the
    two cleaners stand beside and just behind the mobile hallway thingy.
    Everyone is paying close attention.  Everyone is serious.

    As the plane rolls in, the parker waves those two orange sticks in
    parallel to each other to tell the pilot to come straight on in.
    Then, when the wheels of the plane are in just the right spot, the
    parker crosses the orange sticks into an X. This signals the pilot
    to put on the brakes.  At this point everyone's attention focuses on
    the parker's X, except for the baggage guy.  The baggage guy sees
    the X and then hops off the baggage tractor and uses these yellow
    brick like things to chock the wheels.  The parker is carefully
    watching the baggage guy and he does not move the X sign until the
    wheels are fully secured and the baggage guy has moved out of the
    way.  Then the parker folds the orange sticks together, and holds
    them over his head horizontally.  This signals the pilot that he
    can release his brakes and shut down the plane.  The greeter has
    been watching all this intently and when the orange X goes away, he
    knows it is safe to move the hallway thingy up to the door of the
    plane.  When the hallway thingy starts moving, the two cleaning
    folks know that the plane has shut down enough that it is safe to
    head toward the rear exit of the plane.  Meanwhile the parker and
    the baggage guy have moved the baggage tractor in place and started
    to unload the luggage and the greeter opens the door and lets the
    passengers off.

    Now, this was not a monumental task that was accomplished.  It
    happens thousands of times everyday.  But I was impressed that such
    a plain task was so carefully orchestrated.  And I could tell by the
    way the crew acted that this was a highly scripted occasion.
    Everyone had their responsibility.  And everyone depended on each
    other to do certain things at certain times.  They were working as a
    team.

    For those of you who don't work in a corporate environment, you have
    to understand that companies are constantly waging propaganda
    campaigns to change our attitudes and make us better workers.  I'm
    sure they are sincere and well meaning, but after awhile, you've
    heard so many company campaigns that you begin to tune them out.
    Management trends come and go.  Buzzwords come and go.  In my
    particular company, since I've worked there, we've had, "Total
    Quality," "10X improvement," "Market Driven Quality," "ISO-9 000,"
    and now "personal business commitments."  But "teamwork" is the one
    mantra that we never, ever stop hearing about.

    But they have somehow gotten off track.  The corporate idea of
    "teamwork" is this warm fuzzy mutual support group sort of thing, no
    doubt designed by a psychologist, in which everyone is responsible
    for everything at all times, in which no one is supposed to worry
    about the shortcomings of others, in which everyone is supposed to
    make their egos subservient to the goals of the team, in which
    everyone is supposed to do anything and everything to "get the job
    done."

    But it doesn't work that way.  Teamwork is not picking up the slack
    from your teammates when they fail.  Teamwork is not _needing_ to
    pick up the slack from your teammates.  Teamwork is not where
    everyone shares all the responsibilities, but where everyone has 
    clearly defined roles.  Teamwork is where more of your personal ego
    is invested in the project rather than less.  As a passenger on the
    plane, which version of teamwork would you want the ground crew
    practicing?

    ===================================
                             True Story     
    Shakespeare Goes Goth

    From the Life-Imitates-Art Department with more than a little help
    from the Surrealists Association thrown in for good measure, here's
    a true story that happened to me just a few weeks ago.

    I had gone out to eat dinner with my neighbors and good friends, the
    Haslups.  And afterwards, we decided that we would stop by the video
    store next door and rent a movie or two to watch.  So we all trooped
    into the Video Bar to pick out a movie.  But having just gorged
    myself at an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet, I wasn't much in the
    mood for walking around the video store.  I was too stuffed!  This
    particular video store had sort of a waiting area off to the side
    for the employees or whatever.  So Irene, her son Chris, and I sat
    down at the table while her husband Lee went off in search of
    movies.

    Naturally we started talking about movies.  Chris and I got
    sidetracked into a discussion about the movie, "The Crow" since
    there is a sequel coming out this summer.  This led into a
    discussion about the difference between the Goth (or Gothic) scene
    and the Punk scene.  Chris didn't understand that in "The Crow" the
    good guys are gothics, while the bad guys are punks, so I was trying
    to explain the difference.

    For a quick Cliff's notes version of subculture taxonomy, let's just
    say, for the purposes of discussion, that the Punks are the angry,
    violent, social misfits that listen to noise that sometimes, but not
    usually, resembles music.  Goths are the brooding, pale,
    dressed-in-black tragic looking folks that always look like they've
    just had a death in the family, if not their own.  They listen to
    mournful, ethereal dance music and only come out at night.  Perhaps
    the one accoutrement that the Punks and the Goths have in common is
    that they tend to pierce their bodies with metal studs.  Maybe
    that's why people confuse the two.

    Anyway, this was just normal, idle conversation to pass the time.
    No big deal, nothing unusual.  But I was a little frustrated because
    Chris wasn't really following what I was trying to say about the
    Goths.

    And then I noticed this book.  It was sitting there on the table
    where we were..  It was a thin brown book that looked like it had
    come from the back shelves of a library.  It looked old and had one
    of those built in ribbon bookmarks in it marking a page in the book.
    Well, I couldn't resist.  I picked up the book without even reading
    the title and opened it to the marked page.  And it turned out that
    the book was the collected sonnets of William Shakespeare and the
    ribbon was marking Sonnet #127, which due to some bizarre
    synchronicity, perfectly captures the Gothic attitude:

      In the old age black was not counted fair,
      Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
      But now is black beauty's successive heir,
      And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
      For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
      Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,
      Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
      But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
      Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
      Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
      At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
      Slandering creation with a false esteem:
        Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
        That every tongue says beauty should look so.

    Stuck In Traffic is a monthly magazine dedicated to evaluating
    current events, examining cultural phenomena, and relating true
    stories.

    Why "Stuck In Traffic"?
    Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an
    opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the
    personal to the global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the Art
    of Motorcycle Maintenance_, "Let's consider a reevaluation of the
    situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the
    zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible situations,
    but the best possible situation you could be in.  After all, it's
    exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much trouble to
    induce...."
