         The Price of Oil in Cary

         _Holy Fire_: A Review 
         I don't usually think of this 'zine as a review 
         'zine.  But every now and then I get so excited 
         about a book or movie that I have to share with the 
         readers.  Such is the case with this book.  

         God Comes To Garland 
         The real spectacle behind God's Salvation Church 
         has nothing to do with Flying Saucers.

                              True Story
   The Price of Oil In Cary

   I've learned some of the most important lessons of my life while 
   shopping at Wal-Mart.  I know that's a very politically incorrect 
   thing to say these days, but it's true.  There's a little replica of 
   the real world within the walls of every store and all you have to do 
   is look around to learn about the human condition.  Long time readers 
   of _Stuck In Traffic_ will recall that it was at Wal-Mart that I 
   learned about the excesses of Marketing and got a headache while 
   shopping for Tylenol.  And it was at Wal-Mart that I learned the most 
   about how racial harmony is truly achieved.  

   The latest lesson I learned while shopping at Wal-Mart came from the 
   Automotive department and, like so many world events these days, 
   started with speculation over the price of oil.  

   Call me lazy if you must, but I simply refuse to change the oil in my 
   car on my own anymore.  I used to try to change my own oil.  But I 
   never once got proficient at it enough to be able to do it in under 
   40 minutes.  And I never could do it without making a mess.  And then 
   there's all that old oil that has to be taken to the appropriate 
   recycling center.  So, if time is money, I've concluded that it's 
   simply not cost-effective for me to change my own oil.  

   Wal-Mart is by far the cheapest place in the town of Cary to get your 
   oil changed.  If you go to one of the national chains of oil change 
   shops, you could easily spend $26 on an oil change.  And even with a 
   coupon, you rarely get out of those places for under $20.  And the 
   national chains of oil change shops are always looking for excuses to 
   charge you money for something extra.  On the other hand, Wal-Mart 
   will change your oil for about $16 and that includes the price of the 
   oil and the oil filter.  Occasionally you'll hear about a local 
   garage that will do oil changes for a little less as part of a 
   promotion of some sort.  But Wal-Mart has this low price everyday.  
   And going to Wal-Mart has the added benefit that I can shop for 
   household stuff or do grocery shopping at the grocery store next door 
   instead of waiting in some grungy waiting room that has a TV blaring 
   so loud that I can't even read.  The price is right.  I get better 
   use of my time.  And I can always depend on them.  

   So not too long ago, I got up early one Saturday morning and trooped 
   off to the Wal-Mart for my oil change ritual.  I dropped off the car 
   at the Wal-Mart auto center, did my grocery shopping and by the time 
   I got back the car was waiting for me outside So I loaded up the 
   groceries into the trunk, headed back inside and got in line at the 
   counter to pay.  And what do you know, I found myself standing in 
   line behind the Honorable Mayor of Cary, Koka Booth.  

   While bursting at the seams with growth, Cary is still small enough 
   that it's not too terribly unusual to run into elected officials 
   during the course of every day events like getting your oil changed 
   at the local Wal-Mart.  This was by no means the first time I had 
   seen Mayor Booth in person.  When I first moved to Cary, he and I 
   lived in the same precinct.  He and I were always among the first in 
   line on election day.  And we would chat a little while waiting in 
   line in that civic fashion that folks do on election days.  I also 
   saw him once at a the local ice cream stand.  And of course I've seen 
   him on public access TV extolling the virtues of voting for bonds to 
   pay for parks and schools, etc.  

   And despite his unusual name, Mayor Booth is as regular a guy as you 
   could ever hope to meet.  Nothing about him sticks out as the least 
   bit unusual.  Nothing about him is going to attract attention in a 
   crowd.  But I recognized him right away as I got in line at the 
   Wal-Mart, even though mostly all I saw was the back of his head.  But 
   I didn't say anything to him.  I'm just not much into small talk, and 
   somehow standing in line at the check out counter didn't seem 
   conducive to a political debate on the merits of city growth versus 
   the merits of restricted and planned development.  (Besides, he and I 
   pretty much agree on that subject anyway.) So I was content to leave 
   him alone in peace.  But there was another man shopping in the 
   automotive department that wasn't nearly so considerate of Mayor 
   Booth.  He rounded the corner of an aisle with a shopping cart full 
   of spark plugs, air filters, and kids and his face lit up as soon as 
   he saw Mayor Booth.  

   "MAYOR BOOTH," he bellowed so loud that you would have thought that 
   he had hijacked the PA system in the store, "GREAT TO SEE YOU!" And 
   he rushes up to the Mayor and starts introducing himself to the 
   mayor.  Or I guess I should say reintroducing himself.  Because he 
   starts going on about didn't the mayor remember him and his son at a 
   softball game a couple of years back and the mayor had given the 
   whole team some sort of award or something.  The kid was awestruck 
   His father was gushing.  And everyone else within shouting distance 
   was trying to discreetly check out the scene and whispering to each 
   other, "is that _really_ the mayor?" as if they were somehow 
   suspicious that this might be some sort of joke on the poor fellow 
   standing in line in front of me.  

   And it was a kind of a joke, in a way.  Because after a minute or 
   two, Mr.  Enthusiastic shuffled off with his cart load of kids and 
   Mayor Booth was left there, standing in line, with a room full of 
   people still staring at him, whispering at him, pointing fingers at 
   him.  Whereas he had formerly been Mr.  Anonymous just going about 
   his chores, now he was a public spectacle.  

   I caught him looking around a little and when he looked behind him, 
   at me and the rest of the people in line behind me, I got a glimpse 
   of his face.  He looked like an animal trapped in headlights of an on 
   rushing car.  Frozen out of shock and fear.  I wanted to say 
   something like, "Man, that must suck to have to deal with that kind 
   of stuff everyday." But I didn't.  

   But as he was looking around sizing up the situation, I swear there 
   was a visible transformation of his appearance and demeanor.  I got 
   an up close and personal look at his ability to morph from Mr.  
   Everyman to Mr.  Mayor right before my eyes.  I'm not sure how to 
   explain it.  But it seemed like all of a sudden he got more animated 
   in his movements and body gestures.  His eyes lit up as if some sort 
   of switch had been turned on in the back of his head.  He started 
   making good old fashioned eye-contact with everyone he could.  

   Now, cynical folks may say, "Well, he was putting on a show.  He 
   wasn't being sincere.  It was obvious that he was not being his usual 
   self." But that doesn't bother me a bit.  Of course he was.  Elected 
   officials have to play the _role_ of an elected official.  That's 
   what people expect of them.  Who in the world doesn't act a little 
   bit differently when they are the center of attention?  So I wasn't 
   too surprised by this radical change in his personality, but it was 
   sort of shocking to see the transformation right in front of me.  

   About that time, it was his turn with the cashier, and the young lady 
   behind the automotive check out counter began ringing up his bill 
   with all the nervousness of someone in trying to do their normal job 
   in the presence of a big celebrity.  She was all thumbs.  But finally 
   she managed to get the cash register to spit out a bill and she told 
   The Mayor his total for the oil change.  A debate ensued.  

   Seems that the price was significantly higher than what the Mayor had 
   expected to have to pay and he demanded an explanation.  "Demanded" I 
   say only in the sense that he simply refused to let the matter drop.  
   He never raised his voice.  He never acted upset.  But he also kept 
   asking questions about the bill and asking the poor little girl at 
   the register if she agreed that something seemed to be wrong with his 
   bill.  Now the price of an oil change has not changed at the Wal-Mart 
   for the entire time that I have been going there, so I was naturally 
   curious to hear the outcome of this debate.  The price did seem a 
   little high to me, by 3 or 4 dollars.  Curioser and curioser.  

   By now, everyone in line knew that there was some kind of hold up.  
   And lets be honest, every single one of us was watching the 
   mini-drama unfold to see how The Mayor of Cary was going to handle 
   this apparently blatant overcharge.  How was he going to handle this?  
   Was he going to lose his cool with the check out girl?  Would he let 
   the matter drop and just pay it?  Was he going to use his mighty 
   powers of Mayor to kick Wal-Mart's ass?  

   More debating ensued for several minutes and then an uneasy stalemate 
   was reached.  Neither the Mayor nor the check out girl were saying 
   anything new.  The Mayor repeatedly pointed out the advertised price 
   for the oil change that was clearly posted on the wall and how there 
   was an extra, cryptic charge on his bill that made the total higher 
   than it was supposed to be.  The poor check out girl could only 
   defend herself by saying over and over that that's what the computer 
   had rung up for his bill and she couldn't explain it but that it must 
   be right if the cash register said it was.  

   The Mayor was very calm and cool and collected.  He never once 
   implied that the girl was trying to cheat him or that there was any 
   sort of malicious activity in progress.  But there was one thing 
   about him that I noticed.  While not actually raising his voice, he 
   was speaking just a little bit louder than necessary.  There is no 
   doubt in my mind whatsoever that the Mayor was putting on a show for 
   the rest of us in line.  He was role playing.  

   The poor check out girl, on the other hand, was looking very nervous 
   and scared.  Finally, FINALLY, she had the bright idea that maybe she 
   ought to call a supervisor to come deal with the situation.  And she 
   did.  

   So while we are waiting for the supervisor, Mayor Booth keeps talking 
   about how the bill doesn't seem right to him and he doesn't 
   understand this one cryptic charge on the bill for the extra couple 
   of dollars.  He goes on about this for another few minutes until the 
   Supervisor arrives.  By this time, of course, everyone within earshot 
   knows exactly who The Mayor is and everyone knows exactly what the 
   situation is.  Again, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that 
   The Mayor was deliberately repeating the situation so that everyone 
   knew what the score was.  

   Frankly, it was wearing thin.  It had now been a good 7 or 8 minutes 
   since The Incident had begun.  

   The Supervisor took about 30 seconds to decipher the bill.  Seems 
   that the advertised price for the oil change only buys you 4 quarts 
   of oil.  The Mayor's mini-van took more oil than 4 quarts of oil and 
   so the cash register had added an extra charge for the extra oil.  
   The supervisor even pointed out the not-so-fine print on the sign 
   above the register that mentioned this fact.  

   Whew.  "Well, that explains that," I thought to myself.  

   But no.  There was more.  The Mayor of Cary and the Supervisor 
   proceeded to debate the price of oil.  The Mayor wanted to know 
   exactly how much more oil above the 4 quarts did they have to put in 
   to the minivan.  The mayor wanted to know how much they charged for a 
   quart of oil?  Did they charge retail prices or wholesale prices for 
   the oil?  There were many questions.  The Supervisor, not having done 
   the actual work couldn't answer these questions.  

   The Mayor kept asking them in that not loud but loud enough anyway 
   voice of his.  

   Well, there was nothing else to do except consult the mechanics in 
   the garage.  So the Mayor of Cary, The Supervisor, and the poor check 
   out girl all marched off in a single file line to the garage for more 
   Investigations.  

   It was very quiet in the check out line all of a sudden.  And without 
   a show to watch, it also got very boring very quickly.  We fidgeted.  
   We stared at each other in line.  

   Finally, to break the nervous silence more than anything else, I 
   turned to the couple waiting behind me in line and said to them, "Ya 
   know, if it were any other time except now, I'd be very proud to have 
   a penny pincher for a Mayor." 

   And as soon as those words came out of my mouth, I realized that I 
   had once again learned an important life lesson in my neighborhood 
   Wal-Mart.  I realized that.  everyone, in every democracy on the 
   planet, feels exactly the same way.  

   =====================================
                      Cultural Phenomena
   _Holy Fire_: A Review

   Without a doubt, Bruce Sterling has to be classified as one of the 
   key figures in the cyberpunk genre of science fiction.  But first 
   with _Heavy Weather_ and now with his latest novel, _Holy Fire_, 
   Bruce Sterling has evolved his storytelling into a form that, if not 
   outright mainstream, at least appeals to a much broader spectrum of 
   science fiction fan.  

   _Holy Fire_ reads like a traditional cyberpunk tale in the sense that 
   there are multiple threads of the plot interweaving with each other 
   and seen through the eyes of a single character.  The story jumps 
   from one locale to the next as can only be done in a truly Global 
   Village setting.  Like all the best cyberpunk, there are a wide 
   variety of exotic and sometimes scary people along the way.  Like the 
   best cyberpunk novels, the protagonist in Holy Fire is living by her 
   wits, improvising, making things up as she goes along, not so much 
   with a plan as a goal.  

   But in Holy Fire, the rogue Artificial Intelligence programs are no 
   longer the key characters.  Most of the software in _Holy Fire_ is 
   well domesticated and even (somewhat literally) house trained.  
   Unlike the traditional cyberpunk novel, cyberspace is not the primary 
   stage in which the players interact.  Cyberspace is there, but it is 
   treated rather matter-of-factly by the characters in the story, much 
   the way we take our phones for granted.  

   But the thing that radically breaks _Holy Fire_ out of the cyberpunk 
   mold is the protagonist, Mia and her quest to relive her lost life 
   and to capture something elusively referred to as the Holy Fire.  Mia 
   is a 94 year old woman, living in the late 21st century where the 
   world has just emerged from decades of plagues and other biological 
   disasters.  The world Mia lives in has become thoroughly democratized 
   and totally focused on the preservation and the elongation of life.  
   Since the government in Mia's world is strictly democratic and the 
   population is aging more and more due to the improvements in medical 
   technology, the elderly population have become the majority and the 
   dominant voting bloc.  This leads to self-perpetuating feedback loop 
   in which global policy continues to be focused more and more on life 
   extension technologies and young people become second class citizens.  
   Mia is a "medical economist" and as such spends her life evaluating 
   the cost/benefit ratios of various life extension technologies.  So 
   we see first hand through her eyes the obsession that her world has 
   on preserving the body.  

   Early in the story, Mia attends the deathbed of one of her 
   ex-husbands for whom she feels neither remorse nor love.  In fact we 
   find that she's very uncomfortable and even borderline disgusted at 
   having to deal with bonds of past romances lost long ago.  It is 
   clear that in this world after you live to a certain age, people's 
   attitudes about personal relationships changes dramatically.  Their 
   society refers to it as becoming "post-human".  And it becomes clear 
   to Mia through a chance encounter with a couple of "kids" in their 
   early twenties, that the post-human condition isn't all it's cracked 
   up to be.  

   While she can't quite articulate it, Mia realizes that she can no 
   longer live in the medically obsessed world she helped create.  So 
   she signs up for the riskiest life extension treatment there is and 
   walks out of it with the body of a 20 year old only to realize that 
   her world is not going to let her live the life of a 20 year old just 
   because she has the body of one.  Instead they are going to treat her 
   like a lab rat.  

   So Mia not only has to escape the clutches of her medical keepers, 
   she has to fumble her way across Europe, trying to discover for 
   herself what in life is worth living for.  And along the way she 
   finds a whole subculture, a lost generation of young people 
   struggling to answer the same question in a world where all the 
   power, success, and money is tied up in the hands of the 
   gerontocracy.  

   Bruce Sterling explores that question from the viewpoint of many 
   different characters in his book and with varying degrees of success 
   they all reach more or less the same conclusion: That a long life, 
   without the Holy Fire is no life at all.  So while the story telling 
   technique in _Holy Fire_ is the tried and true cyberpunk format, the 
   theme in _Holy Fire_ is as universal and ancient as it gets.  

   =====================================
                          Current Events
   God Comes To Garland

   Just in case you were wondering, God did _not_ appear on Channel 18 
   on March 25th to announce his return to earth.  He did _not_, in 
   fact, descend from the heavens in a cloud-like UFO to the backyard of 
   a suburban house in Garland, Texas.  And, as near as anyone can tell, 
   God did not take over the body of Mr.  Hon-Ming Chen, leader of the 
   God's Salvation Church who owned the house.  

   It seems that Mr Chen is a little confused about the prophecies that 
   God is sending him in visions.  .  Indeed, one might even dare to 
   think Mr.  Chen a bit touched, out of sorts, disoriented, delusional, 
   loony, or stark raving mad.  

   God's Salvation Church, aka "Chen Tao" aka "True Way", was founded in 
   Taiwan sometime in the 1950's by Mr.  Chen a former sociology 
   professor and apparently dropped his profession after he started 
   receiving messages from God in 1992.  The Church moved to San Dimas, 
   Californis soon after because they believe that the United States 
   will be spared the upcoming nuclear war that will be started in 1999.  

   In the frenzy that followed the Heaven's Gate suicide, the Church was 
   exposed and they quickly dropped "God Saves The Earth Flying Saucer 
   Foundation" from the many names that they used for their Church.  
   They also determined that God would be coming to Garland, Texas, so 
   they left San Dimas and bought 21 houses in a Garland neighborhood.  

   As the March 25th deadline for God's arrival neared, the Garland 
   neighborhood was swamped with news reporters from around the globe 
   and there was a frenzy of comparisons to the Heaven's Gate cult and 
   dire warniings about "possible mass suicide attempts" even though the 
   members of God's Salvation Church do not believe in suicide.  In fact 
   they quite ardently believe that killing one's self is the same thing 
   a killing God.  

   And if God's Salvation Church is in fact a cult, as they have been 
   described to be by nearly anyone with access to publishing media, 
   they seem to manage to be a cult without any particularly bad habits.  
   In fact, by all media accounts they seem to live and coexist quite 
   peacably with their neighbors.  

   The media frenzy about God's Salvation Church originally broke out 
   when the Taiwanese mother of a 16 year old girl claimed that the 
   church had kidnapped her.  But when the authorities investigated the 
   matter they discovered that a more proper interpretation of events 
   was that the girl had run away from home and gone to San Dimas 
   because her father, who was a church member, had recently died of 
   cancer there.  She was apparently staying with her uncle.  

   And while it is true that the members look quite comical in their 
   white robes and white cowboy hats, neighbors in the Garland 
   neighborhood have steadfastly refused to say that they felt 
   intimidated by the cult.  Amused, yes.  Intimidated, no.  Although 
   Mr.  Charles Amyx, who lives next door to Mr.  Chen, was reported to 
   have expressed concern over the fact that his homeowner's insurance 
   didn't cover "acts of God," and was therefore somewhat concerned 
   about being so close to where "the Godplane" was going to land.  

   While God's Salvation Church managed to coexist somewhat peacfully 
   with their suburban middle class neighbors, the media circus that 
   converged on the scene as the March 25th deadline drew near did not.  
   There were so many news vans and reporters in the neighborhood that 
   residents could not get to their houses.  The police had to set up 
   roadblocks at the neighborhood entrances and let only residents and a 
   limited number of reporters in at a time.  Residents complained that 
   their carefully cultivated lawns had been destroyed by inconsiderate 
   reporters trying to get to Mr.  Chen's house.  

   Personally, I'd like to complain that the so-called journalists even 
   considered this event to be news.  If ever there was a case of going 
   after the titilation instead of the news, this is it.  Here we have a 
   bunch of harmless eccentrics finding God in their own crazy way, 
   living a peaceful life, mostly getting along with their neighbors.  
   And our news media can't leave them alone for fear of missing the 
   next big mass suicide.  

   If it were any other religion, we'd call it persecution.  

   As a society, we talk and talk about the importance of valuing 
   diversity.  We talk and talk about the strength we garner from 
   incorporating all sorts of people, views, and cultures into our 
   melting-pot society.  Yet we seem to be unable to tolerate harmless 
   religious eccentrics.  We seem to be unable to stop drooling at the 
   thought of mass suicide.  We seem to be unable to truly let other 
   people think and believe differently.  We seem to pretty damn narrow 
   minded when it comes to religion.  

   Everyone has to find God in their own way, even the members of God's 
   Salvation Church.  And if we find their religious practices amusing 
   and comical, then we should keep it to ourselves.  Or at very least 
   we should not openly tease them about their beliefs.  

   And after all, if, as the the church members believe, Jesus has been 
   reborn and is a 27-30 year old man currently living in Vancouver, 
   British Columbia, well, we'll all feel more than a little bit ashamed 
   of ourselves won't we?

   Why "Stuck In Traffic"?  

   Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an 
   opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the 
   personal to the global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the Art 
   of Motorcycle Maintenance_, "Let's consider a reevaluation of the 
   situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the 
   zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible situations, 
   but the best possible situation you could be in.  After all, it's 
   exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much trouble to 
   induce...."
