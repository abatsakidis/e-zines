    Ancient Ritual
       
    There are still some of us who remember the ancient ritual, but not
    many.  We performed this ritual every fall, while the trees and plants
    were dying, while animals retreated to their dens, while birds flew
    away, while the sun grew colder and colder.  We celebrated not just
    death, but all of nature's dark, mysterious forces.  We celebrated the
    super natural, the ethereal, and the undead.  We paid tribute to them
    so they would be placated for another year.

    The ritual was not just a reminder that there are dark forces roaming
    the world, but that there are dark forces roaming within ourselves.
    Forces that can't be harnessed, can't be tamed, can't entirely be
    understood.

    No matter how spiritual, no matter how clean, no matter how civilized
    we become, we are inextricably tied to nature, pagans by fate, and
    therefore subject to nature's beautiful maelstrom.  Our ritual
    acknowledged and celebrated this.

    Many people called this ritual "Halloween."

    Not me.  Not anymore.

    Our forays in to the darkness on Halloween night have been smothered by
    reflective tape and shopping mall sales events.  Our roars and screams
    have been replaced by "Trick or Treat" and "Thank You."  Our plunder
    has been inspected and sanitized for our protection.  Our Haunted
    Houses have been turned into charity events.  Witches have been
    enslaved as door ornaments.  Ghost stories have been perverted into
    morality plays.  Newscasters tell parents how to "Take the Goblin out
    of Halloween."

    This does not bode well.  The ancient ritual that once bore the name
    Halloween bears no resemblance to the event people today call
    Halloween.  I'll have no part of it.  To refer to both that time
    honored ancient ritual and today's subjugation of it as Halloween is a
    crime against nature.  And I predict she will exact her revenge
    someday.  I fear for civilization.

    Last year I resolved to not participate in Halloween the next year and
    I more or less kept my word.  No costume.  No candy on the doorstep.  I
    made a point of not being home for Trick or Treaters.  I just couldn't
    bear to hear one more kid tell me "Thank you" on Halloween night.  By
    chance, I spent Halloween with friends.  And although we did attend a
    costume contest at a local movie house, we did not participate.  Why
    design a costume if you are going to admit up front that it's a
    costume?

    And although I couldn't bear the thought of participating in the false
    Halloween, I also couldn't help feeling an emptiness for not at least
    having tried to do Halloween right.  As I drove home that night,
    shortly after midnight, the streets in my town were empty.  Not a
    single ghost to be seen.  Not a single monster lurking in the shadows.
    What shadows?  There were streetlights everywhere.  As I drove through
    my neighborhood, there wasn't a single sign of mischief.  No one was
    roaming about.  There wasn't even a single smashed pumpkin in the
    street.

    But something out there knew.  Something out there knew that I had the
    right Halloween spirit.  When I pulled into my driveway, there, on the
    darkened front porch, sat a black cat, very still.  I wouldn't have
    even noticed it except that it's yellow eyes flashed back the
    reflection of my car's headlights.  And as I pulled in to the driveway.
    It did not move.  It just sat there, perfectly composed, watching me.

    I looked it over as I got out of my car and headed inside, but I did
    not approach the black cat.  I did not try to pet it.  That was my
    tribute to Halloween.

    =====================================
    My Encounter With The Nation of Islam

    Watching Minister Farrakhan's speech in D.C.  reminded me of a brief
    encounter I had with the Nation of Islam.

    A couple of years ago, I attended COMDEX, which is this huge trade show
    for the computer industry, in Atlanta.  On the last day of the show,
    Farrakhan (or at least someone from high up in his organization) was
    holding a rally across the street from the convention center site.  As
    I was leaving the show there was a flurry of activity around the
    building where the speech was being held.  So I sat on a near by bench
    and watched.  At that time I didn't really know much about the Nation
    of Islam and Farrakhan.  To tell the truth, about all I knew about them
    was that they always dressed up when they got together and wore
    bow-ties as sort of a trademark trait.  I had heard rumors that
    Farrakhan had made derogatory remarks about Jews and saw everything in
    terms of racial conflict.  But the Nation of Islam had just never
    broken through my consciousness enough for me to pay any attention to
    it.  In fact at the time I couldn't even think of Farrakhan's name.

    I gathered that the speech was currently going on inside and that when
    it was over, the speaker would be coming out.  There was this group of
    about 60 men dressed up in Nation of Islam style apparently there to
    serve as a sort of honor guard for him as he left.  Everyone was
    dressed up, very stern, and of course wearing the trade mark bow-tie.
    The thing that impressed me the most about these men was how organized,
    and serious they were.  This was obviously a big deal to them.

    So the big moment came and the speaker did eventually come out.  But
    from where I was sitting I couldn't see who the dignitary was.  In any
    event, it went off without a hitch.  There was a brief ceremony of
    sorts where the dignitary acknowledged the honor guard.  Some words
    were exchanged, and then he was off in a big car of some sort.  Whoever
    the organizer was then dismissed the men and they began to break up and
    leave.

    My initial reaction was that this was overkill.  I'm accustomed to
    seeing this level of pomp and circumstance only at government events
    and other big institutions like Universities, etc.  And then it dawned
    on me, that was the point.  It's sort of a chicken and egg thing.  On
    the one hand, big institutions create with them a mythology and
    protocol.  But in other ways, the pomp and circumstance _creates_ the
    institution.  It's an _opportunity_ for people to take the institution
    seriously.  It's just that it seems so rare these days for people to be
    that formal for anything not related to the state.

    So the show was over and I headed for the subway to go back to my
    hotel.  As it turned out, I shared a subway car with several of the
    honor guard and a whole bunch of people who had attended the speech.  I
    was the only white person in the subway car.

    Did I feel scared?  Did I feel uncomfortable.  No.  Well yes, sort of.
    Not because I was the only white person in the subway car, but because
    I was so _underdressed_ compared to everyone else.  If you've ever been
    to one of these trade shows, you know that they are _huge_.  You spend
    a lot of time walking down aisle after aisle of exhibits, milling
    around in crowds, getting hot and tired and thirsty.  So dressing for
    comfort is a must.  I was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt, lugging
    around shopping bags full of brochures and free stuff I'd scammed at
    COMDEX.  Everyone else in the subway car was dressed in their Sunday
    best.

    But aside from the way people were dressed, the fascinating thing about
    my subway ride was just how _civil_ everyone was to each other.  Now,
    even though all these people had been attending the same speech, they
    really didn't know each other.  It was about like church.  You may know
    a few of the people you were with, but most people are vague
    acquaintances at best.  People were chatting softly to each other.
    Helping each other on and off the car, waiting patiently for their
    turn, etc.

    There were two men sitting next to me.  One dressed up in Nation of
    Islam style and the other in his Sunday suit.  The fellow in his Sunday
    suit struck up some sort of conversation with me about COMDEX, what it
    was etc.  And we chatted about it for a while.  I could tell the guy in
    the bow-tie was listening, but he didn't say anything.  Eventually the
    small talk ran its course like small talk is apt to do and I felt some
    sort of obligation to return the interest that had been shown to me.
    But, frankly, I couldn't really think of anything to say.  I simply did
    not know enough about the Nation of Islam to make any sort of comment
    or intelligent remark.  I wanted to comment on the fact that everyone
    was dressed up on a weekday.  But, in a rare spark of diplomatic
    sensibility that never comes to me except at the most crucial times, I
    didn't.  I sensed from the crowd in the subway car that everyone wanted
    to maintain the sense that dressing up on a weekday was not the least
    bit unusual and that being on one's best behavior was a normal,
    everyday thing.  So I wasn't going to dispel the good feelings.

    Finally, I decided to had to bluster my way through this somehow.  It
    wasn't a matter of fear in any way, but an overwhelming desire not to
    be rude.  I asked the fellow I had been chatting with if he was with
    the Nation of Islam, and he said yes.  And oh boy, all of a sudden I
    felt eyes on me from all over the place.  People were still talking
    amongst themselves, but I could feel the eyes.  If I had known then
    what I know now about the Nation of Islam, I would have understood why
    everyone was all of a sudden interested in what I had to say.  But at
    the time, I didn't have a clue.  All I knew was that it was some sort
    of black empowerment organization.  So next I said, "It looks like you
    had a great turn out" in a positive tone of voice and he said yes it
    was a great speech.  And the fellow on the other side of me dressed in
    his Nation of Islam outfit was still listening in, paying attention.
    So I said to him, "Were you in the honor guard?"  The term "honor
    guard" seemed to take him by surprise but I thought it was an
    appropriately generic term for what I had observed.  In any event, he
    said yes, and didn't mention what he thought the correct term was.  I
    asked him how he got to be on it and he said that they were selected
    from members of the local organizations.  So I said, "Congratulations!"
    in an upbeat and hopefully sincere tone of voice.

    Well, that broke the tension on the subway car and I sensed mass
    relaxation.  I didn't know why people had tensed up in the first place
    and I didn't really know why everything was all right now.  But it was.
    I got the impression that the honor guard was sort of a civic
    leadership thing, a community leader type.  Not having a clue about
    what to say of the Nation of Islam, I decided to play on the sense of
    community I was picking up.  So I changed the subject and asked his
    advice as to which was the best stop for me to get off of to get to my
    hotel.  And I wasn't just making this up, I was a little confused
    because the subway maps are never drawn to scale.  And he told me and
    we talked about the places to eat nearby etc.  etc until I got to my
    stop.  I didn't say "Goodbye" or "Nice talking to you" or anything else
    when I got to my stop.  I just said, "OK, thanks."  and left.  I got
    the feeling that anything else would have been too much.

    It's amazing how enjoyable a subway ride can be when everyone acts
    civilized and minds their manners.

    So I find it a shame that Minister Farrakhan is such a racist.  So many
    of the things he says are good.  He talks about self-respect in very
    real and concrete terms.  He talks about self-responsibility and
    chastises people for whining about their lot in life.  He talks about
    taking an active role in your community.  The man oozes with Family
    Values, though his views of gender roles, I think, would strike most
    people as a few decades out of date.  But in so many ways he is
    positive, motivating, and inspirational.  Based on my experience on
    that one brief subway ride, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind
    that Farrakhan has had a tremendously positive effect on the lives of
    many black people.

    I find it equally shameful that the press tends to focus on only the
    racist side of The Nation of Islam.  Yes, Minister Farrakhan's remarks
    need to be exposed to the light of public scrutiny and judged for what
    they are.  I'm not suggesting that the press should overlook his
    tendencies.  Far from it!  But the press could also show some of the
    positive effect he has had on blacks as well, but they haven't.  They
    will talk about it a little every now and then, but only in the vaguest
    of terms.  And that's a pity for two reasons.  First, because the story
    of how some blacks have turned their lives around by following
    Farrakhan's role model is such a positive story.  But second, and more
    importantly, the _real_ story in Farrakhan's Nation of Islam is the
    paradox between the values he encourages people to practice and the
    motivations, i.e., his racism, that he uses to motivate blacks to adopt
    those values.
                                           
    Hopefully the men who attended Farrakhan's rally will be able to sort
    the good part of his message from the bad.  I'm optimistic that they
    will.

    Some Thoughts On Christmas
                                             
    Like a lot of people, I get really tired of Christmas.  I would enjoy
    the Christmas season a lot more if it were a lot shorter and a lot
    simpler.  I get tired of the build up to The Big Day.  I'm sick of
    hearing Christmas Carols turned into sales jingles.

    But I'm equally tired of hearing people complain about how bad
    Christmas is.  I don't appreciate their smug holier than thou attitude
    when the pooh-pooh the commercialization of Christmas.  I believe that
    most people really do have the right Christmas spirit deep in their
    hearts and the fact they get caught up in the Christmas Buying Frenzy
    doesn't change the fact that they are doing it for others.

    Let's face it.  Most of us feel like we aren't kind enough to our
    fellow man often enough.  Not that we don't mean to.  But the urgent
    things in our lives tend to obfuscate the important things in our
    lives.  It's an affliction of the modern life we lead.  Christmas is
    like a naturally occurring antidote to this modern malady.  It comes
    around once a year and demands attention from us.  It gives us an
    opportunity to spend time on important things like show our loved ones
    how much they mean to us and spending some time and energy helping
    others in need.  Some people do this in a very commercial and material
    way and others don't.

    So to the people who are really into the Christmas Season, I say,
    "Great!  Go for it!  Do it up big!"  To the people who don't care for
    "the commercialization of Christmas" I say, "Fair enough.  You aren't
    required to participate."  But I don't believe there is any correlation
    between one's devotion to the spirit of Christmas and how much or how
    little they participate in the commercial trappings of the season.
            
    ============
    The Shutdown
                                             
    The fun side of the shutdown was the media coverage because it gave
    lots of people the opportunity to make fools of themselves.  My
    favorite gaffe, was the post office spokesman reassuring people that
    social security checks would be delivered on time because the post
    office is "independent" of the government and not affected by the
    furloughs.  Excuse me?  When the government pumps hundreds of millions
    of dollars a year (I don't think their into the billions yet) in to the
    post office system and they _still_ lose money and when the government
    prevents other companies from competing with the post office by
    preventing them from putting things in a mailbox, then I have to
    conclude that the Post Office is totally dependent on the government
    for their very existence.

    Another favorite faux pas heard during the government shutdown was that
    government retirement pensions were being used to give the government
    enough cash to pay its debts during the shutdown.  I'm not an expert in
    government accounting but it is my understanding that the government
    retirement pensions are already being used to "offset" the debt and
    make it look smaller.  So the government effectively used the
    retirement pensions twice.  While it is apparent that the Treasury
    Department did this in order to make the shutdown look more severe and
    thus generate pressure on the Congress to settle the budget matter, I
    think the public will remember this incident as an example of how the
    government will do anything in he name of expediency no matter how
    wrong.  How are all these government employees going to feel knowing
    that the government, in a matter of hours, could zap their retirement
    pensions for whatever purpose it wants?  If I were a government
    employee, I would be terribly concerned about the security of my
    retirement.

    On the first day of the government shutdown, all the major networks had
    this as the big story for the day, of course.  One of them, I forget
    which, showed the "debt clock" on TV that day.  The debt clock is this
    big sign in some major city, New York I think, that continually flashes
    what the current national debt is.  It's this huge number and the
    number increases so fast you can't read many of the digits.  But when
    the government shutdown, it literally could not borrow any money and to
    reflect this, the debt clock was stopped.  So during those couple of
    days that the government shutdown, the national debt was not
    increasing.  The amusing thing about all this was that the new
    broadcaster was trying to make this sound awful.  They were showing the
    debt clock on TV and the newscaster was speaking in borderline
    hysterical tones about how the government could not borrow any more
    money and therefore the clock was shutdown.  Frankly, I thought it was
    something worth dancing in the streets for!  I'd call this a positive
    side effect of the shutdown!

    At first, there were some glib comments from the media about furloughed
    workers getting "unplanned holidays" but they quickly changed their
    tune to "forced holidays" and talked about how federal workers were not
    getting paid.  And there were at least some federal workers in our area
    that volunteered their time off to do community service for various
    organizations in the area.  Of course this got lots of media coverage.
    And I'm glad they did.  It's good to see people doing some good for the
    community for a change.

    The real net effect of the shutdown was actually very minor.  I believe
    it was mostly political wrangling between the Congress and the
    President.  It made for great TV for a couple of days but that was all.
    However, as the country's financial crisis gets more and more urgent, I
    can foresee a day when there is a government shutdown every year while
    the budget is hammered out.  And as the crisis grows and grows, the
    political stakes in the budget battle will get higher and higher.  The
    more heated the battle of over the budget becomes, the longer these
    government shutdowns are likely to be.  And the government shutdowns
    might start being long enough to cause actual problems.  So while the
    recent shutdown was not very important in terms of actual effects on
    the nation.  It is perhaps an omen of things to come.  The recent
    government shutdown doesn't just show that the government is broke; it
    shows that the government is broken.

    =========================
    The Bosnia "Peace" Treaty
                                             
    These modern times sure are complicated and confusing.  Why is it that
    during the war in Bosnia we could not, would not send in troops, but
    now that there is a "peace treaty" signed, we can send in 20,000-40,000
    American troops, and tens of thousands of troops from other NATO
    countries in to Bosnia to "keep the peace"?  It's absurd.

    If the warring factions in Bosnia were really interested in peace, they
    would have settled their differences way back in 1992 when they
    negotiated their last treaty.  But as the world can see from their
    actions since then, the various factions in Bosnia are more interested
    in blowing each others' brains out than in peaceful coexistence.  And
    if the peace treaty had any hope of being successful I don't think it
    would take thousands and thousands of military personnel from around
    the globe to "keep the peace."  I can see the validity of a peace
    treaty that calls for a small number of neutral observers from other
    nations to come in and observe each side to see that they are abiding
    by the terms of the treaty.  But the scale of our military commitment
    to Bosnia is nothing short of a military invasion.  If it takes this
    many thousands of troops to make sure that the treaty is enforced, then
    I have to conclude that the treaty is meaningless and the two sides are
    intent on continuing their war.

    I'm afraid this does not bode well for our American and NATO "peace
    keepers."  Rather than acting like impartial international observer
    checking on treaty compliance, they will be acting like a third person
    trying to break up a fight between two other people.  I am scared that
    it won't be long until the American and NATO troops are viewed as much
    as the enemy as they are viewed as peace keepers.

    It seems quite obvious to me that Bill Clinton has been intent on
    making the war in Bosnia an example of his foreign policy leadership.
    Watching the news from the Ohio peace negotiations, it was clear to me
    that the Clinton administration simply would not take "no" for an
    answer.  There was absolutely going to be a treaty signed no matter
    what so that Bill Clinton could score some points on the campaign
    trail.  And he got a treaty, though even the national media has to
    admit that it's a "fragile peace" at best.  But it is a treaty
    nonetheless and Bill can cite this as proof of his leadership for the
    `96 campaign trail, at least until American soldiers start getting
    killed over there.  I'm sure Bill hopes that doesn't start until after
    the elections.

    So now Bill has two military invasions to his credit.  First there was
    the Haiti invasion.  And interestingly enough, no one in the Clinton
    administration talks about what's going on in Haiti these days.  I
    wonder why not?  How peaceful is the peace down there?  Now there is
    the Bosnia invasion to "keep the peace."  And one might credit Bill
    with the Somalia invasion because, while he wasn't the one who
    initiated it, he was the one who managed it.  In any case, I believe we
    have ample evidence of Bill Clinton's style of leadership as Commander
    In Chief to make a judgement for the `96 elections.

    But what about the opposition?  Where have the Republicans been?  Are
    they for sending troops to Bosnia or not?  It's been very difficult to
    get straight answers from any of them.  Even Bob Dole has been
    uncharacteristically wishy-washy on the issue.  Some days it seems he
    supports it and some days it seems he's against it.  Most Republicans
    however seem to try to avoid taking any stand at all on the worthiness
    of sending 20,000 military troops to Bosnia.  This is inexcusable.
    When the nation is faced with a military operation of this magnitude,
    when this many lives are at stake, I believe it is a moral _imperative_
    for our representatives to voice a clear opinion on the issue, either
    for or against, so that there can be a national debate.  But the
    Republicans have not done so.  Instead, they make half-hearted
    complaints that Congress has been bypassed by the President and that
    the President is not supposed to send troops off to a military
    operation without getting Congress' approval.  Which is true enough,
    but it shows the depth of their hypocrisy.  They certainly didn't
    complain when a Republican President was sending troops all around the
    world without getting the approval of the Democratically led Congress.
    If the Republicans had any backbone at all, they would be taking a
    stand on the issue.  And if they decide that they are opposed to the
    military invasion of Bosnia, they could be exerting a lot of pressure
    on the President to pull out.  All this whining about Congress being
    bypassed by the President is just a distraction to avoid having to take
    sides on the issue.
