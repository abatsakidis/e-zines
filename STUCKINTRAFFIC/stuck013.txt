    Neither Sticks Nor Carrots

    Poor Bill Clinton.  His Bosnian "peace keeping mission" is looking more
    and more tenuous all the time.  What must have first appeared as a sure
    fire way to boost his reputation as a strong leader on foreign policy
    issues has been steadily degrading into a situation that some people
    are labeling the "Lebanon of the '90s."  And as if his foreign policy
    record wasn't weak enough, recent military events in Cuba and China
    show that Clinton's foreign policy strategies simply aren't working.

    First, the Cuban military shoots down two civilian aircraft from the
    United States that were flying toward Cuba.  Some reports indicate that
    the people flying the planes were part of an underground paramilitary
    movement whose goal is to overthrow the Castro regime, but one knows
    for sure.  In any event, they were civilians in civilian aircraft in
    international airspace over international waters when they were shot
    down.  There are well documented and well established procedures that
    every civilized country in the world has agreed to follow in these
    situations to avoid shooting down civilian aircraft while still
    maintaining an ability to apprehend civilians suspected to be engaged
    in illegal activity.  For whatever reason, Cuba blatantly disregarded
    these procedures.

    The United States was outraged.  The rest of the world condemned the
    shootings.  The world eagerly watched for the United States' response.
    But nothing happened for several days while the White House "studied
    its options".

    The White House hinted that it was considering some sort of military
    action but never took any, which was probably a wise move.  Who would
    the U.S.  attack in retaliation?  Cuban military targets?  Cuban ships
    in international waters?  Castro himself?  And more to the point,
    Castro would probably love a military confrontation with the United
    States right now and no one knows just how far Castro might be willing
    to escalate a military conflict.  And even though the United States
    keeps close tabs on Cuba's military strength, there's no way we could
    guarantee that Cuba would not be able to hit targets in the United
    States.  Without military options at his disposal, Clinton was
    desperate to show some sort of leadership, Clinton finally proposed an
    economic embargo on Cuba.  

    But wait, don't we _already_ have a _total_ economic embargo on Cuba?
    Yes, we do.  But the one that the Clinton proposed and congress passed
    was somehow "tougher" than the current embargo.  Just how it was
    "tougher" is not clear.  But other North American governments, most
    notably Canada, have already complained that the new embargo law
    asserts extraterritoriality rights to interfere with other countries'
    commerce that the United States does not have.  There will likely be
    diplomatic wrangling over the new "tougher" embargo for months to come
    and it's difficult for anyone to say with certainty that the United
    States will be able to do anything differently under the new, "tougher"
    embargo than under the old embargo.  The net effect?  Cuba got away
    with the shootings.  Clinton's reputation as a weak and indecisive
    foreign policy leader was reinforced.

    And then there's China, the crown jewel of the Clinton Administration's
    foreign trade plan for the nation.  For years, the Clinton
    administration has been negotiating with the Chinese government.
    Enticing them to improve their human rights record, respect
    international law, and reform their communist system of government with
    lures of trade agreements, most favored nation trading status, and the
    like.

    Now, just as Taiwan celebrates its first fully democratic elections,
    China has been "testing" its capability to fire missiles into Taiwan
    and stepped up its rhetorical claims that Taiwan is not an independent
    country, but a "rogue" province.  Clinton has responded with a show of
    military strength in the area, warning China that the U.S.  would
    likely come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked it.

    Suddenly, all the progress made over the past couple of years on
    improving relations with China has been called into question.  Were the
    Chinese ever really serious about human rights and economic reform?  Or
    were they just telling us what we wanted to hear so that we would give
    them trade concessions?  One thing's for certain, if the United States
    does enter into a war with China over the independence of Taiwan, trade
    agreements will be the first diplomatic casualties of the war.  So
    while Clinton has proved to be quicker than usual in deciding how to
    respond to China's threats, he has at the same time undermined
    everyone's confidence in the Chinese trade agreements.  What company
    wants to make major investments in China knowing that the United States
    could easily find itself at war with them?

    Bill Clinton's fundamental problem in both of these situations is not
    so much that he failed to take action or did the wrong thing, but that
    so much of his foreign policy strategy is based on the idea that
    hostile governments can be led or coerced by economic incentives.  In
    the case of Cuba, 30 years of a total economic embargo has failed to
    change Castro's mind about how to run a government and has failed to
    generate any grassroots movement for change within Cuba.  In the case
    of China, doling out economic favors has failed to produce anything
    from the Chinese except the tamest lip service toward to notions of
    basic human rights or democratic self-government.  Trade in goods and
    services with the United States can neither be used as a stick to beat
    on our opponents with nor a carrot to lead them down the right path.
    Bill Clinton should stop trying.  It just makes him look more like a
    fool.

    The Robots Are Coming!  The Robots Are Coming!

    It seems that every couple of years, there is a rash of news stories
    about factory automation.  We are treated to hordes of news stories
    about how factory workers are being replaced by robots by this company
    or that company.  We see Japanese factories that are so automated that
    they don't even have lights installed in them because the robots don't
    need them.  American car companies proudly show off their robotic
    assembly lines in their car commercials.  We hear about vision systems
    being designed for robots.  We see stories about how much more agile,
    how much faster, and how much more accurate robots are.  These news
    stories are invariably accompanied with dire warnings about how the
    boom in robotics spells doom for unskilled workers.  We are left with
    the question, "How will unskilled workers be able to support their
    families?"  I believe that this panic mongering is totally unfounded.

    Robots are still quite limited to the types of tasks they can do.
    Despite all the hype, robots are far from being general purpose
    machines.  They are designed to do only one very specialized, mostly
    repetitive task.  It's impossible for them to do anything outside of
    that vary narrowly defined task.  It is true that robots are becoming
    more accurate, faster, cheaper, and more flexible.  And jobs that are
    literally repetitive motions and _nothing_ else will eventually be
    mechanized as robots become more agile.  But so what?  Those jobs have
    a very high "burn out" rate and high turn over.  No one really wants
    those jobs anyway, especially at low wage rates.

    But does that mean there will be millions of out of work, unskilled
    people roaming the streets?  I don't think so.  Not any time soon at
    least.  Most jobs that we think of as "unskilled" nonetheless require a
    human touch, or at least are sufficiently engaging that an unskilled,
    but conscientious worker can and would do a better job than any machine
    could.  I'm thinking primarily about a services type industries.  Would
    you want a robot for a receptionist?  Would you rather a robot or an
    enthusiastic person asking you, "would you like fries with that?"
                                            
    Furthermore, I think you have to have a pretty static notion about the
    concept of a job to think that machines will take over and replace
    essentially unskilled labor.  Job duties are always changing.  There
    are always unexpected events that must be dealt with.  There are always
    opportunities to demonstrate creativity, no matter how humble the job.
    An unskilled, caring crew member at McDonald's acquires additional
    value and "skill" simply by accumulating experience regarding the best
    ways to run the restaurant over time.  I'm not sure that machinery has
    reached this level of sophistication yet.

    I think there are lots of jobs that are sort of borderline between
    being "unskilled" and "skilled."  Take for example, a clerk in an
    auto-parts store.  Basically his job his helping customers identify a
    part they need and then retrieving the part from the store's warehouse
    if it's in stock.  That much of the job could be automated.  You could
    probably even automate placing a special order for a part that's not in
    stock.  But a _good_ clerk will do much more than that for his/her
    customers.  A good clerk will know about all the competitors in the
    area and will be willing to help a customer track down parts if his
    particular store does not have them.  A good clerk will know about
    alternative options for finding parts in the surrounding area.  Where
    are the good junk yards?  Who gives the best deals?  A good clerk will
    develop "inside connections" at the company's warehouse and will be
    able to get special orders quicker than the official company policy
    says is possible.  If the hypothetical clerk learns all these things
    over his tenure at the store, who can say he is not skilled?  Who can
    say he is not educated?  A good clerk at an auto parts store will
    transcend his humble position and become an "auto parts broker."

    I don't think a machine has yet been invented that can replace a
    caring, conscientious worker who has a good work ethic, no matter how
    "unskilled" he or she may be.

    The Politics of Hog Waste

    June 21st, 1995.  Onslow County in the eastern part of North Carolina.
    25 million gallons of raw sewage is accidently spilled into the New
    River.  On the same day, in Sampson county, another spill dumps another
    1 million gallons of raw sewage into river tributaries.  State
    environmental officials scurry around investigating and, by the end of
    the summer, they have documented spills and leaks of raw sewage in
    North Carolina totalling 35 million gallons, triple the size of the
    spill of the Exxon-Valdez.  How could this happen?  Who's at fault?
    Aren't there laws against this sort of thing?  You might think that
    answering these questions is simply a matter of following the trail of
    muck up stream until you found its source.  But you would be wrong.
    The vast majority of the $35 million gallons of raw sewage was spilled
    from "family farms" and almost all of it was hog sewage.  And that has
    made all the difference.
                                           
    Hog farming has become big business in North Carolina over the past
    couple of decades.  Agricultural scientists and politicians have long
    sought ways to vitalize the poor economic regions of in the eastern
    part of the state and wean farmers off their key cash crop of tobacco.
    They've tried to lure big industrial concerns to the area with only
    limited success.  They've tried to get farmers to grow other crops with
    only a little more success due to the poor quality, sandy soil in the
    region.  But raising hogs has worked.  North Carolina has literally
    revolutionized the hog farming industry with high-tech, high density
    contract hog farming.

    High density contract farming has been around for a while in other farm
    industries, most notably chicken farming.  But one North Carolinian by
    the name of Wendell Holmes Murphy, whom our local News & Observer
    derisively refers to as "Boss Hog", adapted this farming technique to
    hog farming and made himself rich.  Other companies quickly followed
    his model, setting up hog farms all over eastern North Carolina (now
    known as "The Hog Belt").  Currently, about 7 million hogs per year are
    produced on North Carolina hog farms and they industry is still growing
    fast.  The economic boon so many politicians had been looking for was
    here.

    In the old days of the family farm, you built a hog pen at the back of
    your lot somewhere and kept a couple of dozen hogs in it.  You fed them
    feed you bought from your local mill supplemented with scraps and
    refuse from your dinner table or local grocery stores.  When the hogs
    were fully grown, you loaded them on a truck and took them off to
    market to be sold and slaughtered.  The problem is that it takes
    several years to raise a hog.  If your hogs catch cholera and the
    government quarantines your farm, you've lost your multiyear investment
    in the hogs.  And even if you are able to get the hogs to market,
    there's no guarantee that you will be able to sell the hogs at a profit
    since hog prices are quite volatile and it's difficult to know years
    ahead of time what the prices will be.  So a farmer doesn't really know
    how many hogs he can afford to be raising.

    Contract farming reduces the small family farmers' risks because the
    farmer doesn't actually own the hogs he's raising.  Instead, he signs a
    contract with a corporate hog wholesaler like Prestige, Carroll's
    Foods, Smithfield, and Murphy Family Farms, in which he agrees to raise
    a certain number of corporately owned hogs on behalf of the corporation
    in exchange for a fixed fee per hog.  The great thing about this system
    is that the farmer knows ahead of time just how much money he's going
    to receive for the hogs.  The corporations assume the risks of buying
    and selling hogs in the commodities markets.  That's what they're good
    at and how they make their money.  The contract farmer is responsible
    for the capital investment in his farming buildings, machinery, and
    land; but these are factors that are relatively fixed, fairly easily
    predicted, and within the farmers' control.  And even though these
    farms are typically owned by an individual family, they are no longer a
    "small, family farms" They are big operations.  You can't just build a
    hog pen on the back of your lot anymore and put a couple of hogs in it.
    You have to build "hog confinement barns" which can cost in the
    neighborhood of $300,000 dollars but are capable or raising thousands
    of hogs at a time.

    But farmers are flocking to this new system of farming because there
    are big bucks to be made.  A careful, efficient farmer can make pay off
    the mortgage on his hog barns in 10-15 years and still make about
    $10.00 per hour during that period.  After the mortgage is paid off on
    his barns, he stands to make big money.  Of course nothing is
    guaranteed in any business, but the risks are well within the norm for
    any small business.  Oh, and by the way.  There's just one more tiny
    important detail about the contract farmer's role in this system.
    According to state law, since he is the one in charge of the actual hog
    farming operation, he is also responsible for environmental safety
    concerns.
                                           
    It's amazing how often the economic interests of the state fall in line
    with the economic interests of business.  It's easy when they are
    represented by the same people, as is the case with North Carolina's
    hog industry.  Not only is the hog industry one of the biggest
    contributors to political campaigns in the state, the politicians
    themselves are often also hog farmers.  Lauch Faircloth is a hog farmer
    by trade.  Jim Hunt, North Carolina's Governor, is the biggest
    recipient of contributions from North Carolina's largest hog company.
    The chair of our State House environmental committee is going into the
    hog raising business.  The chair of the state senate's committee on the
    environment and agriculture is the pork industry's biggest recipient of
    campaign contributions.  But no where is the collusion between the hog
    industry and the government more obvious than the career of the man of
    who is most responsible for North Carolina's hog farming revolution,
    Mr.  Wendell Holmes Murphy, founder of Murphy Family Farms and former
    state legislator for 10 years.

    During his tenure as a state legislator, and at the same time he was
    growing his hog raising business, Mr.  Murphy sponsored, lobbied and
    supported a steady stream of laws designed to help the farming
    industry.  Equipment related to raising stock on a farm is exempt from
    sales tax.  Gasoline used in transporting livestock and livestock feed
    is exempt from sales tax.  Ingredients purchased for feed for hog and
    poultry production are exempt from the 12 cent/ton inspection fee.
    Feed and other supplies used in raising livestock is exempted from
    county property taxes.  "Bona fide" farms, including hog farms, cannot
    be regulated by a county under it's zoning authority.  This prevents
    counties from dealing with issues like odors from the farms,
    annexation, etc.  Farmers, including hog farmers, are exempt from labor
    laws, minimum wage laws, and vehicle weight restriction laws.

    Are these favors good for Mr.  Murphy's economic interests?  Are these
    exemptions good for the hog industry?  Are these exemptions good for
    farmers in general?  Are these exemptions good for the economy of the
    state?  One can reasonably answer "Yes" to all these questions.
    Lifting the burdensome taxation and regulation of the state is always a
    benefit.  (One wonders why we don't lift these regulations for _all_
    industries) And according to North Carolina law, it's entirely
    "ethical" for a legislator to lobby for legislation that would be
    favorable to his economic interests as long as they can say that his
    economic interest does not cloud his judgement.

    What about protecting the environment?  What about those 35 million
    gallons raw hog sewage spilled into North Carolina waters?
                                           
    Because of the way the law is structured in North Carolina, the owner
    of the hog _farm_ is responsible for the environmental impact of his
    operation, not the owner of the actual _hog_ itself.  Though I don't
    know the history of how this came to be, I think it's safe to assume
    that this is not by accident.  The farm owners are held responsible for
    the hog waste specifically because they are the one who can least
    afford it.

    Next to his mortgage payments and his stock feed expenses, getting rid
    of all that hog waste is the most expensive and difficult problem a hog
    farmer faces.  And we're talking about lots of hog waste.  The average
    hog produces twice as much waste as the average human.  So North
    Carolina's 7 million hog population produces roughly the same amount of
    raw sewage that the city of New York does.  If the hog farmer had to
    process all that sewage in waste treatment centers just like cities
    have to do with human sewage, it would be a huge addition to his
    expenses.  So the state government/hog industry has been kind to the
    "small, family farmer."  Instead of requiring farmers to process the
    hog sewage and make is safe before discharging it, the state just lets
    hog farmers spray the sewage on the ground.

    This is actually a cheap, efficient, environmentally friendly way of
    getting rid of the sewage.  The ground absorbs the sewage and bacteria
    break down the sewage into harmless nutrients that are good for the
    soil and crops.  The main problem is the unpleasant smell.  But this is
    usually done out in rural areas where it's not so much of an issue.
                                           
    The problem is that too much of a good thing can also be bad.  And this
    is the case with the high density hog farms.  The land can absorb only
    so much sewage at a time and if you spray it on too often or too
    heavily, nitrates begin to build up in the soil and eventually start to
    contaminate the local water supply.  And if you spray hog sewage on the
    ground during wet and rainy weather, the ground can't absorb it and it
    seeps directly into the water table before the ground can neutralize
    the sewage.

    For these reasons, the state requires hog farmers to build hog waste
    "lagoons" these are open air pits dug into the ground that hold the hog
    sewage until it is a safe or convenient time to spray the sewage.
    Holding the sewage in these lagoons also gives bacteria time to break
    down the harmful sewage before it's discharged.  Some states require
    that hog waste lagoons be lined with clay liners so that they don't
    leak into the surrounding ground.  North Carolina doesn't.  Again
    because that would be a burdensome expense on the poor, "small, family
    farmers."  In theory, the lagoons are self sealing.  And in practice
    they are self sealing most of the time, although there have been cases
    discovered where old lagoons develop slow leaks over time.  The state
    carefully regulates how many hogs a farmer may raise on his land based
    on the farmer's capacity to process the hog waste, i.e., the size of
    his hog waste lagoons.  And excess capacity for the hog lagoons is
    always factored in to account for unusually long spells of wet rainy
    weather when the farmer can't spray the sewage.

    What the state apparently does not take into account for is the fact
    that hog farmers are human beings, just like everyone else and are
    therefore prone to delaying unpleasant tasks like dealing with hog
    waste.  As a result, some farmers let their lagoons get too full before
    emptying them.  If they get too full and then there is an unusually
    long wet spell, they get dangerously full.  This is exactly what
    happened last spring.  Some farmers had lagoons that were too full to
    begin with and then we had an extremely wet and rainy spring.  Some of
    the lagoons got so full that their dikes collapsed, flooding the
    surrounding area with millions of gallons of sewage.

    OK.  A farmer gets lazy.  His lagoons get dangerously full.  They burst
    through their containing dikes, and dump raw sewage into streams.
    What's the state going to do?  Fine him?  Sue him?  First of all the
    damage is already done.  But more to the point, what good does it do to
    sue a family farmer?  He's already deeply in debt with his hog barn
    mortgage and so there is no way the state is going to collect enough
    money to pay for the clean up.  You can put him in jail as punishment.
    You could confiscate his farm.  But the only thing you can do with a
    seized hog farm is sell it to another hog farmer.

    In an ideal world, you would expect that the people who make a profit
    from the hog industry are also the people that bear the liability and
    responsibility for the damages and risks of the venture.  Every citizen
    of the state is required by law to dispose of his own waste in a
    environmentally responsible way by subscribing to his town's sewer
    service.  Many cities and towns across the nation even require you to
    clean up your pets' waste and dispose of it properly.  But this is not
    an ideal world.  The people responsible for writing and passing
    legislation are also the same people who benefit, either directly or
    indirectly, from the hog industry.  So the one thing we _haven't_ heard
    proposed amid all the recent hog waste scandals are proposals that the
    hog _owners_ should legally be responsible for the risks and
    liabilities associated with hog waste.

    Instead we hear more and more proposals from the legislature about how
    the state needs more power to regulate farm owners to make sure they
    don't screw up in the future.  The state needs more money to spend on
    monitoring the hog waste lagoons.  The state needs more money to study
    the environmental impact of sewage seepage.

    It's not hard to understand why the politicians are proposing a larger
    role for the government in monitoring the hog farmers' activities as a
    solution.  Is it good for their economic interests?  Yes, since the hog
    owners won't bear the costs.  Is it good for the farmers?  Yes to a
    degree.  The likely result of closer state monitoring will mean that
    they have to spend more time on waste treatment issues, but their
    business investment in their hog barns will remain mostly intact.  Is
    it good for the economy of the region?  Yes.  The basic economics of
    the industry will remain unchanged.  Is it good for the taxpayers in
    the state?  No!  Because they will be the ones who have to pay for the
    expanded state budget.  But wait.  Convince them that this is good
    sound investment in the protection of our environment and people will
    agree that it's good for them as well.  And that's exactly the way our
    state legislature has approached the hog spill disasters.  According to
    the legislators, this is not a problem of legal liability being
    misplaced, it is an environmental problem that can only be addressed by
    increasing the state's budget to protect the environment.

    Remember, the state says that a legislators' actions are "ethical" if
    his economic interests in a matter do not interfere with his judgement.
    If he can propose a solution in which everyone feels like they have
    benefitted, how can anyone blame him for unethical behavior?

    Whether you blame this shameful situation on big business or on big
    government is mostly a matter of your personal political biases and
    arguing about it doesn't get you any closer to a plan that will prevent
    these disasters from happening in the future.  Both are to blame.  The
    only solution is to return the responsibility and liability for the hog
    waste back to the hog owners where it belongs.
