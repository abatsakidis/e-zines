Clinton "delays" missle decision

The BBC and other news services are reporting that President Clinton 
has decided to "delay" making a decision on the missle defense system.  
The relevant soundbites from Clinton are: 

          "I simply cannot conclude with the information we 
          have today that we have enough confidence..." 

and 

          "We should use this time to ensure that NMD, if 
          deployed, would actually enhance our overall 
          national security," 

Figures.  President Clinton has never been one to take a stand on an 
issue unless the public sentiment is absolutely clear.  But on this 
one, the public is divided, so he's not about to make a stand on the 
merits of a missle defense system.  Besides, this is an election year.  
No way is he going to stir up trouble and turn national defense into 
an election issue.  

President Clinton is more or less _making_ a lame duck of himself.

                     Current Events
Senate Debates China Trade Bill

The U.S.  Senate is debating landmark trade legislation that would 
open up trade with China, allowing U.S.  businesses greater access to 
China.  Businesses strongly back the effort, citing the huge potential 
markets there.  It's interesting to observe how North Carolina's 
Senators are taking positions on the issue.  

Senator Jesse Helms strongly opposes opening up trade with China, 
claiming that we should not do business with a country the not only 
opposes religious freedom and human rights, but actively persecutes 
them.  Helms is offering several amendments to the legislation:
 
          Delay granting of permanent normal trade relations 
          until China has met a series of human-rights 
          conditions.  

          Establish a voluntary code of conduct for U.S.  
          businesses in China, urging them to look out for 
          human-rights abuses.  

          Require China to stop jamming Voice of America and 
          Radio Free Asia broadcasts.  

          Voice the Senate's opposition to the Chinese 
          government's practice of forced abortion and 
          sterilization policies.  

          Require reports on the effect of the trade bill on 
          agriculture.  

          Require the president to suspend normal trade 
          relations after five years if China does not live 
          up to its trade commitments.  

Supporting religious freedom, freedom of the press, and ending forced 
sterilations and abortions are all worthy goals.  But you have to ask 
yourself if blocking trade with a nation has ever improved its human 
rights record.  

Has an economic blockade of Iraq improved the human rights situation 
in that country?  Has it loosened Saddam Hussein's dictatorial grip on 
his people?  Has Libya been liberated from Ghadafi after all these 
years of econimic embargo?  Has North Korea evolved from a Communist 
dictatorship to a budding democracy?  Has 30 years of economic 
isolation reformed Castro and his communist dictatorship of Cuba?  

The answer in every case is nope.  Not a bit.  In every case, economic 
isolation has actually made the situation worse.  In every case, it 
actually strengthens the dictator's grip on his country.  

Still, it's difficult to accept the notion of doing business in a 
country where people are being arrested simply for peacefully 
practicing their religion.  We can't just ignore the problems and go 
about our trading with a blind eye.  

It's important to keep several things in mind.  First of all, doing 
business in a country does _not_ morally legitimize the government of 
that country.  Second, doing business in a country does not stop us 
from voicing our opposition to human rights abuses and it does not 
stop us from publicizing the human rights violations in that country.  
Furthermore, having businesses at work in the country gives us good 
access for monitoring and observing these abuses so they can be 
publicized.  

The biggest reason, though, to support opening up trade in countries 
that have poor human rights records is that liberalizing trade 
practices in a country does far more to help the people of that 
country than it helps the government maintain power.  Trade is 
liberating.  People how are economically destitute have no time or 
energy for working to reform their government and oppose evil.  
They're too busy trying to make through the end of the day without 
starving.  But if we infiltrate a country with trade, start working on 
building a solid, thriving middle class, then there's more hope for 
creating solid, political reform movements in the country.  It's not a 
guarantee of reform of course, but it at least raises the possibility.  

So I applaud Helms publicizing the Human Rights record of China and 
it's something we must never forget.  We must continuously work on 
selling the idea of Human Rights reform to the Chinese just as 
ardently and vigorously as we sell them blue jeans and Big Macs.  But 
economic embargo is not the right way to do it.  

To date, North Carolina's other senator, John Edwards has not had the 
courage to take a stand on the issue.  Says he won't do so until just 
before the vote.  I guess taking principled stand on human rights and 
trade is not something we can expect from Mr.  Edwards.

                       Music Review
"Everything Is Possible"
Os MUtantes
***

Os Mutantes ("The Mutants") were a Brazilian pop band in the late 60's 
whom some people credit for introducing modern pop instrumentation 
(i.e., electric guitars and drums) into Brazilian pop music.  That 
might be overstating the case some, but it's true they managed to take 
some of the trends going on in music at the time, i.e., The Beatles, 
The Animals, experimental jazz ala John Cage, and give it a distinct 
local flavor.  But it would be a mistake to say this band is a British 
Invasion copycat band.  They bring enough originality and attitude to 
the table that their pop culture influences are just that, only 
influences.  

Long since broken up, Os Mutantes now have a CD out of some of their 
best efforts called "Everything is Possible" on David Byrne's Luaka 
Bop records.  Listening to this CD you get a sense for just how 
experimental their time period was.  Each song is very different in 
form and tone, from the long dreamy visions in "Day 36" to hard 
driving rock sound of "My Girl." Lots of psychedelic sounds on this 
one.  You can't help but conjure up visions of GoGo dancers when 
listening to this CD.  

Well, GoGo dancers doing the Bossa Nova that is.

                       Book Review
_The Cluetrain Manifesto_ 
by Rick Levine, Christopher Locke, Doc Searls, David Weinberger
***

Widely touted as the book that outlines the future of business on the 
Internet, I found my self both ardently agreeing and disagreeing with 
it at the same time.  

Ever since the net hit the mainstream consciousness a few years back, 
people have been trying to mold it into different sorts of media with 
only modest degrees of success.  

At first, the net was going to be this gigantic library in the sky.  
Well, that sorta worked but people quickly realized the the 
information on the net is much more ephemeral than the information in 
a library.  And all the really dense information was hiding behind 
some sort of payment request.  

Then the net was going to be the next kind of Television.  Web TV 
baby.  Interactive TV.  Active TV that lets you control the action.  
Seems kinda silly now, but that was the hype for a while.  

Next on the hit parade, was the net as a cool and groovy magazine.  
This was more successful, but it turned out that people don't like to 
read for long stretches while sitting in front of the computer.  They 
don't like to read deeply on the net as much as they like to read 
broadly.  

So none of these analogies worked entirely successfully, but they 
weren't entirely unsuccessful either.  

The good folks at The Cluetrain Manifesto managed to name one of the 
key features of the net that previous analogies failed to account for.  
The problem with other past analogies is they had a built in 
assumption of a few people in control of the content broadcasting to 
the many.  But the thing that attracts most people to the net is that 
it's an opportunity for people to communicate one on one with each 
other.  It's an opportunity to create widely dispersed communities 
rallied around common interests where people can talk, share, and 
enjoy each other's company.  

And that's the part of The Cluetrain Manifesto that rings so very true 
to me.  They argue that people are craving to hear natural human 
"voices" on the net.  They want to talk to other people.  Real honest 
to god people.  They don't want to talk to superstars or 
"personalities." They want to talk to real folks.  

The part I disagree with is the second part of their thesis, which is 
that since people want to hear natural human voices on the net, 
there's no place for Big Business on the net.  They claim that people 
will reject the nameless, faceless, "marketing messages" from 
corporations and demand to interact with companies on a human to human 
level.  

While there's certainly a place for human-to-human communications in 
business environments, I think the authors vastly underestimate the 
necessity of "brand." Anytime you're trying to conduct business long 
distance, when you don't personally know the person you're dealing 
with and when you are unable to personally confront the person you're 
dealing with if something goes wrong.  You have to deal base on trust 
and reputation.  A brand identity is a way to establish that trust.  I 
may not personally know my Honda Salesman, even if I shake hands with 
him.  But I know the reputation of the Honda brand and am therefore 
willing to plunk down a large chunk of my hard earned money to buy a 
car from them.  

So I can't buy into the author's claim that there's no place for 
business or traditional marketing messages on the net.  I think 
there's a place for both traditional marketing and human to human 
communications.  

In any case, _The Cluetrain Manifesto_ is takes a fresh look at the 
net and what the heck the net is good for.

                 Cultural Phenomena
Napster Rap

For months now, the music recording industry has been trying to shut 
down Napster, the online application service provider that allows 
individuals to share songs and other audio performances with each 
other.  If you judged by the amount of press coverage the case has 
been getting, you'd think that the legal case is terribly complex.  
But you would be wrong.  

For some reason, the hype over all things Internet related clouds our 
ability to think straight.  So it helps to try to separate the issue 
from the net with a little thought experiment.  

Suppose a wayward bunch of high school misfits starts up a speed metal 
rock band called "The Whiners in Dad's Garage".  They record a couple 
of songs on a cassette tape using a 4 track recorder they borrowed 
from one of the band member's older sister and slap a home made label 
on it, thus creating the debut of their first album, "Spitballs and 
Outlaws." They make a couple of copies of this tape and pass their 
"album" out to their friends, telling them to listen and then pass it 
on to someone else.  

Anything illegal or unethical here?  Nope.  Not so long as there are 
no laws against poor taste.  

Now suppose Miss Susy Runaround receives one of the precious copies of 
"Spitballs and Outlaws" from one of her fellow cheerleaders during a 
break from practice.  She loves the music so much, (or at least she 
lusts for the lead singer so much), that she decides to help promote 
The Whiners' inevitable ascendency to MTV Fame and Fortune by bouncing 
down to her local Wal-Mart, buying some blank cassette tapes, spending 
$2.00 per tape from her precious allowance, and making copies of 
"Spitballs and Outlaws" to give to her friends.  

Anything illegal or unethical here?  Nope.  And who would dare stop 
young love anyway?  

Now suppose Miss Susy, agog at her ability to boost the popularity of 
The Whiners among the pom-pom crowd, decides that there are other 
musical acts, namely The Backstreet Boys, that are equally deserving 
of her devotions.  So she bops back to the Wal-Mart and buys another 
stack of blank cassette tapes.  She proceeds to make copies of the 
Backstreet Boys latest CD, "Millennium" and give them out to her 
friends.  

Anything illegal or unethical here?  Oh yeah.  You betcha.  

On the back of the CD, right under Brian Littrell's grinning mug is a 
tiny little statement that says, "copyright 1999 - BMG Unauthorized 
duplication is a violation of applicable laws." Susy has clearly 
violated BMG's copyright on the "millennium" CD.  Presumably BMG wants 
the cheerleaders to all go spend their allowance on a personal copy of 
the Backstreet Boys' CD.  Fair enough.  Whether she knew it or not.  
Susy agreed to not make unauthorized copies of the Backstreet Boys CD 
when she bought it and now she's broken that agreement.  She's 
violated copyright law.  

Now, at most there are 20 girls on Susy's cheer leading squad and even 
if Susy made an illegal copy for every girl on the squad it's unlikely 
that anyone at BMG would care or even notice.  But if there were 
legions of Backstreet Boys-infatuated cheerleaders all across the U.S.  
of A doing the same thing.  BMG might start to get worried.  The 
"lost" revenue might start adding up enough to put a minor dent in 
BMG's profits.  

Now, here comes the trick question.  Who should BMG sue?  A) Susy and 
her tape dubbing friends, B) Wal-Mart, or C) the manufacturer of the 
cassette tapes?  Take all the time you need to consider your answer 
carefully.  

An ethical purist would of course answer.  "A) Susy and her tape 
dubbing friends." They are, after all, the ones that violated the 
copyright agreement.  Even if you have a little trouble with the 
concept of punishing those who are the ones that actually do wrong.  
You could arrive at the right answer through a process of elimination.  

Does it make any sense, hypothetically speaking, to sue Wal-Mart 
because they did not require Susy to sign an agreement to not do 
anything illegal with the tapes before selling them to her?  Is 
Wal-Mart responsible for Susy's actions after she leaves the store?  
Does it make any sense to sue the manufacturer of the cassette tapes 
on the grounds that they are facilitating copyright violations?  Is it 
reasonable to expect them to somehow create cassette tapes that can 
only be used for legal purposes and can't be used for illegal 
purposes?  

And what of The Whiners in Dad's Garage?  Remember them?  Assume for 
the moment that BMG has no interest in signing up a band for which no 
amount of air brushing can remove the pimples from its publicity 
photos, even if they do know all of four chords instead of the 
traditional three.  Is it an acceptable legal remedy to outlaw the use 
of cassette tapes for distributing music in order to make sure Susy 
does not violate copyright law even if it prevents The Whiners In 
Dad's Garage from using cassette tapes to distribute their music and 
pick up chicks?  

The ethical purist would, of course, answer, "No." It's just as 
important to make sure that The Whiners In Dad's Garage have the 
ability to distribute their music as it is to protect BMG's copyright.  
Maybe even more important.  

Let's look at a side issue.  Does it matter how much Susy paid for the 
cassette tapes?  Would your answer change from A) to B) or C) if Susy 
paid $1.00 per tape instead of $2.00 per tape?  Suppose Wal-Mart ran a 
promotion in which they were giving away free blank tapes for anyone 
who would walk into their store and look around for a while?  Suppose 
Susy more or less got her cassette tapes for free.  (She just had to 
suffer the indignity of looking at clothing of non-GAP origin in order 
to get her free blank cassette tapes.) Would your answer change from 
A) to B) or C)?  Is it suddenly Wal-Mart's fault that Susy violated 
the copyright law?  

The ethical purist would, of course, answer, "No." 

Moving back to the world of the Internet, replace Wal-Mart with 
Napster and replace cassette tapes with MP3 files.  

If the Whiner's In Dad's Garage record "Spitballs and Outlaws" as a 
collection of MP3 files.  And Susy forwards these files to all of her 
friends.  Is there an ethical problem here?  Nope.  

If Susy converts her favorite songs from the Backstreet Boys 
"Millennium" CD into MP3 files and sends them to her friends, is there 
an ethical problem?  You betcha.  She has still violated copyright law 
and infringed on BMG's copyright.  

Who should be sued in a court of law to remedy the copyright 
violation?  Susy, of course.  

Is it fair to hold Napster responsible for Susy's actions?  No way.  
Is it fair to block The Whiners In Dad's Garage from using Napster and 
MP3 files to distribute their so-called art just because someone 
_might_ use the technology to break copyright law?  No.  The Whiners 
have as much right to the technology as anyone else.  

Does the fact that Napster is an essentially free service (all you 
have to do is endure the web site advertising) change the fact that 
Susy is still the one responsible for the copyright violation?  No.  

And yet, from all indications, the recording industry is more 
interested in shutting down the service that Napster provides than it 
is actually trying to remedy the copyright violations.  

Perhaps the industry realizes that sending a legal notice threatening 
a lawsuit if Susy doesn't cease her copyright infringements to her and 
her Dad might alienate her from her favorite Boy Band and tend to make 
her less enthusiastic about buying next year's Backstreet Boys CD.  
Not good for business.  

Perhaps the recording industry realizes that they can't possibly 
pursue every single small case of copyright infringement that they 
hear about.  So instead they are trying to shut down the distribution 
channel instead of stopping the violators.  This would at least 
severely reduce the ability to infringe on their copyrights.  

And if The Whiners in Dad's Garage are denied access to a cool new 
technology that lets them spread their music around to their friends 
for free, does the recording industry care?  Not likely.  After all, 
there are only so many hours between cheer leading practice.  Susy can 
only listen to a certain amount of music.  As far as the recording 
industry is concerned, the fewer competitors for Susy's devotion and 
allowance money, the better.  

After all, this is the recording industry we're talking about, not 
ethical purists.

                      Movie Review
"Hollow Man"
** 1/2

Also Known as "Gray's Anatomy Goes On A Rampage" 

Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a megalomaniac scientist leading a 
team of researchers in a secret government project that's learning how 
to turn people invisible.  The tricky part, it turns out, is making 
them visible again.  Alas, being invisible, tends to make people more 
cranky, irritable, and aggressive.  Trouble ensues, when Dr.  Crane, 
who's already more than a bit edgy, decides that only he has the right 
to be the first human test subject.  

I liked seeing Kevin Bacon play the disagreeable, yet genius mad 
scientist.  It's probably one of his better roles of late.  

The special effects are darn impressive, even by today's high 
standards.  The scenes where he slowly phase shifts were especially 
creepy because you slowly get to see all his innards exposed.  And he 
truly looks like one of those anatomy models.  

But like so many movies these days, the movie draws out the Big Finish 
with two or three too many cliff hangers.

_The Florence King Reader_
by Florence King
***

Perhaps best known for here acerbic columns in "The Misanthrope's 
Corner" of The National Review, Florence King has a reputation for 
shrewdly exposing the folly's both the high-brow and low-brow elements 
of modern culture.  Looking back over the decades with he in, _The 
Florence King Reader_ makes you realize just how intensely she hates 
everything in the world.  No way could anyone sustain such intense 
barrages of social criticism for so long without being sincerely 
worked up about it.  

In The Florence King Reader, we get samplings of essays from here 
early books, _Southern Ladies and Gentlemen_, _WASP: Where Is Thy 
Sting_, and _He: An Irreverent Look At The American Male_.  Among 
these essays, _The Gay Confederation_ is perhaps the most relevant 
today.  In this essay she indulges in stereotyping of the gay man in 
the south to such an extreme that one is tempted, (and only tempted!) 
to enjoy the caricature before roundly dismissing it out of hand.  

Further into the book, we're treated to an excerpt from a "bodice 
ripper" book she wrote in the 70's, which is particularly interesting 
considering the corner of the sexual revolution she inhabits, We also 
get a smattering of book reviews she wrote for The Raleigh News and 
Observer as well as columns for the National Review.  Each and 
everyone apparently written in the throes of indigestion and 
inebriation, Florence King's command of the written language is 
especially impressive given these circumstances.

                        Book Review
_All Tomorrow's Parties_
by William Gibson
***

In All Tomorrow's Parties, William Gibson continues some of the long 
running story lines he's developed in other works, and it might be 
tempting to dismiss it as just another cyberpunk novel.  But that 
would be terribly unfair for several reasons.  

First, like all of Gibson's other novels, it's a really good cyberpunk 
novel.  We get the usual cast of characters in this one.  There's the 
fellow who lives online practically becoming virtual himself, though 
it's slowly driving him insane to the point he becomes the mad prophet 
screaming in the wilderness who makes just enough sense to scare 
everyone.  We've got a streetwise tough guy, just using his muscle 
trying to get through the day.  We've got lost children of various 
ages.  We've got several ex-girfriends wandering around.  And of 
course, we have the same artificial intelligencers which were 
introduced in previous novels.  To the usual cast of characters, 
Gibson has added some new flavors, the assassin who takes a spiritual 
approach to his work was particularly interesting.  

Second, Gibson is not as enamored with the virtual world as he used to 
be.  Obviously he's been spending more time online since he first hit 
his fame and fortune a few years back.  In All Tomorrow's Party's 
technology is still the driving and prevalent agent of social change 
in the world, but it's also incredibly frustrating.  Instead of people 
seamlessly augmenting themselves with technology, living half in and 
half out of the virtual world, we see people being frustrated with the 
technology.  For example, one character is given a cheap pair of 
virtual glasses from the convenience store he used to work at.  In 
theory they are supposed to provide maps and directions, but the 
problem is they keep showing Our Hero maps of Brazil instead of San 
Francisco where the action takes place.  I think it's sort of Gibson's 
version of a running joke.  

But most importantly, the remarkable thing about this book is it's 
density.  I think Gibson was experimenting with this novel.  I think 
he was seeing just how far he could push the "crammed prose" style of 
cyberpunk without it breaking down.  As a result we get a novel that's 
a scant 276 pages in the hard back.  edition and will probably be much 
less in the paper back.  Most chapters are just two or three pages 
long.  But the writing is so dense I often found myself having to stop 
reading after every couple of pages and just stew on it for a while, 
trying to absorb all the nuances and implications of what I just read.  

It wasn't exactly light, fluffy, reading.  It was challenging work to 
read this novel, but it was worth it.

                       Movie Review
"Drowning Mona"
** 1/2

Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) is not exactly the most beloved person in 
her small town.  In fact, everyone pretty much hates her.  And when 
the brakes on her Yugo fail on the way to work one morning, causing 
her to drive off a cliff and into a river, no one is exactly teary 
when she drowns.  

But when Chief Wyatt Rash discovers that the Yugo was sabotaged he's 
forced to open a murder investigation.  Problem is, everyone in town 
is a suspect.  

As he investigates the murder of Mona, we are introduced to a small 
town so filled with white trash, it makes Jerry Springer look 
sophisticated.  Low morals, low aspirations, low IQ all around.  The 
only two good people in the whole movie, the Police Chief's future 
sin-in-law seem to have any ambition or scruples at all.  So why does 
all the evidence point to him?  

The plot isn't the best I've seen, but the movie is filled with lots 
of good laughs and amusing characters.  Definitely worth a rental.

Olympic Spirit: Then And Now

Note: This essay originally appeared in issue 16 of _Stuck In Traffic_ 

As the Centennial Olympic Games open in Atlanta, it's fitting to think 
about what makes the Olympic Games special.  Amid all the hype, the 
sponsorships, the news headlines, and the pageantry, it's easy to 
forget why we're holding them in the first place.  The Olympics, after 
all, are far more than just an opportunity to sell T-shirts and 
baseball caps by the millions.  

The history of the Olympics can be traced all the way back to the days 
of ancient Greece, then known as the center of the civilized Western 
world.  So we only know about them through legend and myth.  But the 
ideas behind the Olympics are clear.  Every four years, nations set 
aside their differences and people traveled to Greece to participate 
in games of sport.  Soldiers set down their swords and spears and left 
the battlefield and headed for Greece when the time came.  People who 
were enemies one day suddenly became comrades and competitors in the 
Olympic Games.  Whether this is literally true or not is irrelevant.  
That is the myth that has survived, that is the archetype in our 
consciousness.  

The Modern Olympic Games, are quite different and they've lost some of 
that spirit from the Ancient Games.  For one thing, nations don't stop 
their antagonism toward each other for the Olympics.  These modern 
times move far to quickly for that.  The wars continue, the battles 
rage on.  Two countries may be at war with each other while 
individuals from the two countries are peaceably running marathon 
races against each other at the Olympic Games.  

But worse than that even, governments and political activists all 
stripes too often try to use the Olympics to further their political 
goals or make a political statement.  The politically disenfranchised 
have on more than one occasion taken Olympic athletes as hostages, 
interrupting the games, terrorizing the world, and worst of all 
denying innocent people the opportunity to live their dream of Olympic 
competition.  Who can forget the hostage standoff at the Munich games?  

But it's not just the politically disenfranchised that have ruined the 
Olympics in the past.  Governments themselves have done so as well.  
On more than one occasion, a government has "boycotted" the Olympics 
by forbidding athletes from within its jurisdiction from participating 
in the Olympic events.  The arrogance of such boycotts are stunning, 
as if the boycotting nation were saying, "You can't possibly hold the 
Olympic games without us, so we'll just take our ball and go home." 
The United States has done this in the past, and the former Soviet 
Union even went so far as to start their own pseudo-Olympic games, 
called the "Good Will Games," in a bald attempt at coopting the 
Olympics and controlling who gets to attend.  The Olympic Organizing 
Committee does its best to prevent the Olympics from becoming a 
showcase for political statements, but the media coverage is just too 
irresistible for politicos who want to get their message out fast.  
Every nation on earth has reporters covering the Olympics.  There is 
probably a higher concentration of media at the Olympics than any 
other event on earth.  And where there are cameras, you'll find 
political activists trying to get their message out.  

But it's not just the media concentration that threatens to turn the 
Olympics into media showcases for politics.  Part of the problem lies 
in the nature of the modern Olympics themselves.  The modern Olympics 
have been portrayed in the last few decades not as human contests as 
much as national contests.  The image portrayed by the Olympic 
organizers is not one of athletes coming together, but of 
nation-states coming together by sending teams to the Olympics that 
represent their country.  It is a subtle but important difference.  

By treating the athletes not as individuals, but as "teams" 
representing a nation, the nations take center stage.  For example, 
the opening ceremonies always have all the athletes marching into an 
arena, segregated by nation, each marching in under their country's 
flag.  And it is exciting to see all the flags flying.  The pageantry 
is nice and it makes for good TV.  But the athletes tend to get lost 
in all the hoopla.  

It's not just that the national symbols overshadow the individual 
athletes, the Olympic games almost invariably turn into competitions 
between the national teams.  We count the medals that each nation wins 
and compare how many medals "we" have won against the number of medals 
"they" have won.  "They" almost invariably being the nation that we're 
currently at war with or antagonistic with.  The Japanese may be 
whipping our butts in foreign trade and education, but we can beat the 
hell out of them in basketball and we've got the medals to prove it.  
Remember how the everyone in the United States was suddenly a hockey 
fan when it looked like we were going to beat the Evil Empire in this 
particular sport?  

All this is a very sad commentary on the modern Olympics, and we in 
the United States, of all peoples, should know better.  The worst 
struggles in our nation's history, the issues that have caused us the 
most angst, have always centered around the unwise segregation of 
people for arbitrary and inconsequential traits.  The American 
Revolution was born largely out of the belief that "all men are 
created equal" and that one's background, the accident of ones birth, 
confers no special privilege on a person.  No one has the right to 
rule you just because they have "royal blood." And of course the whole 
issue of slavery has been fundamental in forming our national 
character.  Almost from the very founding of this nation, we have been 
striving to rid ourselves of an institutionalized discrimination based 
on the accident of one's race.  And even though we perhaps haven't 
quite reached the point where we are a "color blind nation," we've 
made tremendous strides in the right direction.  

If we can accept that fact that men and women should be judged not by 
the color of the skin, but by the character of their souls and the 
merit of their accomplishments, is it such a stretch to accept that 
the participants of the Olympic games should judged by their speed, 
grace, and strength instead of the accident of which flag they 
happened to be born under?  

Why is this so difficult for us to do?  Part of the reason is that the 
Olympics appear to be _designed_ to glorify the nation-states instead 
of the individual athletes.  That's why the athletes are segregated by 
race during the opening ceremonies.  That's why the athletes wear 
their national flags on their uniforms.  That's why the winner's 
national anthem is played when the medals are awarded.  That's why the 
winners' national flags are hung from the rafters during the awards 
ceremonies, always with the gold medal winner's flag in a dominant 
position over the second and third place winners' flags.  That's why 
the medal winnings are always reported by nation.  The symbolism of 
these arrangements is unmistakable.  

A more proper way to hold the Olympics, one that would be true to the 
original Olympic spirit, would be to ban all mentions of nationality 
from the games.  The one exception might be for cases where 
identifying nationality would help in the logistics of running the 
events.  There's no reason why the opening ceremonies have to 
segregate all the athletes by nation.  They can march in together, 
without national flags.  If you want the visual pageantry of flags, 
let them carry the Olympic flag and streamers of the Olympic colors.  
When medals are awarded at the conclusion of an event, it would be 
more fitting to announce the winner's name than to play his or her 
national anthem.  And I think it would be fitting to let the winner 
address the crowd for a minute or two.  I would much rather listen to 
an athlete say "Hi" to the folks back home than to listen to another a 
national anthem.  

A responsible news organization would not report the tallies of medal 
winnings by country, even if other organizations stooped so low as to 
do so.  A news organization should simply report the names of the 
winners.  It's perhaps reasonable to report where the athlete is from, 
since spectators do tend to be curious about where the winners are 
from.  But it should only be done in the context of painting a picture 
of the individual athlete, helping the spectator get to know a little 
more about the personal side of the athlete.  

The focus of the Olympics should always be on the individual athletes 
because they are the real marvel.  They are the reason we do this.  
They are what's impressive.  It's the dedication a person has to have 
to excel in a sport so well that they qualify for the Olympic games 
that impresses.  Not that they are from a particular country.  The 
Olympics, as the ancients' intended them to be, are symbolic reminders 
of the ability of each and every one of us to transform ourselves 
through sheer force of will.  They show us that we can become "super 
human," or as you prefer, they give us a glimpse of God.  

It's a shame that the modern Olympics games have coopted the spirit of 
the ancient Olympic games and turned them into to a glorification of 
The State.

                       True Stories
WorldCon 2000 Trip Report

WorldCon in Chicago marked a milestone for me in my fannish 
development.  This is the first con in which I spent more time making 
the rounds of the various bid parties and other sorts of parties than 
I did participating in any of the con programming.  I feel vaguely 
guilty about it.  I almost feel like I played hooky from school or 
something.  

Registration was a breeze on Thursday morning.  I hit the registration 
area Thursday morning, just as they were opening.  I had expected 
massive crowds lined up waiting to pick up their registration.  But I 
just walked right up to the counter and didn’t have to wait at all.  

The convention site at the Hyatt was a nice enough convention 
facility, though it suffered from the usual hotel conference syndrome.  
The panel rooms were freezing!  The Hyatt was somewhat confusing in 
its layout.  The convention was held in a series of twisty little 
passages, all alike underneath the Hyatt.  They bordered on 
catacomb-like.  The pocket program books supplied to us by the con had 
maps in them, which helped some, but there were lots of people 
wandering around lost.  

The few panels I managed to attend were interesting.  I attended a 
panel on how to review movies, since I like to review all the movies I 
see, for my website.  I also attended Bruce Schnier’s Cryptography 
panels, which was equally interesting.  

But I managed to miss the Guest of Honor speeches, the Hugos, and the 
masquerade.  I also missed all the live performances, like “Faith,” a 
science fiction opera, “The Martian Chronicles,” and the “Don’t Quit 
Your Day Job” Players.  

Like I said, I feel like I played hooky from the con. 

I did manage to hit the art show, which I thought was unusually good.  
Far and above better than the art shows in recent conventions that I 
have attended.  There was a collage artist that I particularly liked 
and an oil painter that was able to create some very realistic looking 
fantasy landscapes.  And of course the Bob Eggleton stuff was good.  
One of the interesting things about con art shows is that there are 
some artists that show their work at these shows that transcend the 
genre and others that are stuck in the genre.  I find myself attracted 
more to the artists that step out of the genre assumptions and do more 
“mainstream” stuff.  

The collage artist, for example, had a work called “Venus Unveiled,”.  
From a distance this work appeared to be a view of a planet from 
space.  But when you got close to it, you discovered that the planet 
was a collage of hundreds and hundreds of small print words clipped 
from various publications combined with small pictures of beautiful, 
Romanesque ladies, Aphrodite presumably.  

The dealer’s room was not the biggest that I’ve ever seen, but it had 
lots of the sort of stuff that I like.  I’m not big into comics, I’m 
more of a book person and the dealer’s room seemed to be heavy into 
booksellers.  So I spent a lot of time plowing through paper backs.  A 
great way to spend a few hours!  

As I’m sure everyone has heard by now, Toronto won the bid for the 
World Con in 2003.  And they deserved it.  They clearly had the best 
bid parties!  They had a great mix of booze, junk food, and good 
company.  And other bid parties ad these too.  But the Toronto folks 
also had door give-aways of books and cool trinkets and trash.  

Japanese fandom is putting together a bid to host a world con in 2007 
and they had a terrific bid party too.  They were giving out cool head 
bands to people who pre-supported them.  At their bid party they had a 
wide variety of Japanese junk food, some of which was good and some of 
which was really strange.  They also served sake and plum wine, which 
I sampled.  

The Svengali party was notable for it’s 80’s dance music, it’s 70’s 
disco lights bizarrely colored drinks complete with those little 
useless umbrella’s in them.  Sort of a lounge effect, if you’re into 
that sort of thing.  

The slime party had it’s usual spiked jello shots and pineapple bits 
super-saturated with some sort of booze.  

The Mystery God Confusion party had a pagan religious theme, complete 
with a goddess walking around offering sacraments of chocolate covered 
cookies.  Mondo cool.  I told the goddess that I’d be back later to 
worship her, but she refused my devotions.  Sigh.  

There was a hoax bid party which I can’t spell, except for 
phonetically.  It was the chitzineetza bid, which is the location of 
some ancient Incan ruins.  According to the bid committee, the Incan 
calendar predicts the end of the world in 2012 so they figure it’s a 
good chance for an end of the world party.  Their bid party was 
unusual in that they made ice cream with liquid nitrogen.  I wasn’t 
sure what the connection between liquid nitrogen, ice cream, and the 
Incans is, but it was fun anyway.  

The Boston crowd had their usual bid party and next to the Toronto 
Party, it was the busiest one.  But I didn’t stick around too long in 
it.  There was no place to sit and hardly a place to stand.  

Likewise with the Philcon party.  It was a large boisterous crowd of 
good natured people.  But I just couldn’t stay in there for very long.  

The last party I attended was the OddCon party, aka, the Cow Con.  
It’s being organized by some fans in Madison Wisconsin.  They win my 
award for the most bizarre room decorations because they had a shrine 
to a glowing cow head.  Go figure.  

Chicago is full of wonderful things to see and do.  Or so I’m told.  I 
only did a limited amount of venturing out.  One afternoon I went out 
to Lunch with Diane Kurlecz to Joe’s Be Bop House for barbecue.  Very 
good.  Of course, since this is Chicago, it was beef barbecue with a 
reasonably good sauce, though being from Texas I expected a little bit 
spicier.  

On Sunday I went to the Navy Pier with my friend Pat Hario to see the 
display of tall ships that were there.  The crowds were staggering and 
we only got to board two ships.  But we were able to see the others 
from the dock just fine.  It’s amazing to see all the hand made 
rigging and the precise way all the lines are coiled and tied.  I’m 
not much into sailing and things nautical, but I was nonetheless 
fascinated by these ships.  It’s difficult to articulate why.  I think 
it’s something to do with the fact that it’s rare that you see 
something so sophisticated and complex that’s obviously hand crafted.  

I saw so many good friends this con that I felt right at home.  I saw 
many, if not all of the “Lemmings” that I toured Australia with last 
year.  It seems like any time I sat down, one of them walked by and 
struck up a conversation.  And my fellow lemmings introduced me to 
many folks that were lemmings in previous years.  I also had a chance 
to meet many of the people from the TurboCharged Party Animal apa that 
I belong to.  It’s bizarre to finally be able to put faces to names 
I’ve seen in print for the past year.  I’m terrible at predicting what 
people are going to look like!  No one was the least bit the way I 
imagined!  And finally, I ran into several of the fans from my local 
area.  

So this was the first con for me where the people and the parties and 
the socializing were more important to me than the programming.  

Best Button seen at Con: "Uniquely maladjusted, but fun to be with."
Best Bumper sticker: "I drive too fast to worry about cholesterol."

Stuck In Traffic is a monthly magazine dedicated to evaluating 
current events, examining cultural phenomena, and sharing true 
stories.  

                      Why "Stuck In Traffic"?

Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an 
opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the 
personal to the global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in Zen and the Art 
of Motorcycle Maintenance, 

         "Let's consider a reevaluation of the situation in 
         which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, 
         the zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all 
         possible situations, but the best possible 
         situation you could be in.  After all, it's exactly 
         this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much 
         trouble to induce...."
