    How To Defend Ebonics               

    You know the drill.  Ebonics, or "Pan-African Communication 
    Behaviors" or "African Language Systems" for those of you inclined 
    to scholarly pursuits, is, in theory at least, a language that has 
    no spelling rules, double negatives, no plurals, no conjugation of 
    the word "to be," and legitimizes profanity as a new class of word 
    right along with adjectives, verbs, and nouns.  Mention the word 
    "ebonics" these days and everyone within earshot is likely to 
    either break out in fits of uncontrollable laughter.  But amid all 
    the guffaws about ebonics, it's important for us to notice that 
    the funny thing about ebonics is not that people actually speak 
    this way.  Well, OK, it's a little bit funny that people speak 
    this way; but we've been poking fun at them for decades.  What 
    makes ebonics so excruciatingly funny is that there are people, 
    serious people, supposedly scholarly people, who claim that 
    ebonics is a language unto itself.  In other words, the joke is on 
    the education establishment in general and the Oakland Unified 
    School District in particular since they are the ones that have 
    officially declared that ebonics is a language independent of 
    English, at least with regard to official school policy.  

    But despite the fact that the media have consistently focused on 
    the debate about whether ebonics is a "vernacular," a "dialect," 
    or a "language." The ebonics controversy is really all about 
    money, failing government schools, and a dangerous emerging trend 
    in the civil rights movement.  
                                           
                                             
    It's About Money:

    But to dissect the ebonics controversy, one must first be clear 
    about what it isn't.  No is claiming that students should actually 
    be taught ebonics.  No one, particularly not the Oakland Unified 
    School District (OUSD), is suggesting that ebonics is an 
    acceptable means of communication in the United States.  The OUSD 
    has repeatedly stated that they are fully committed to ensuring 
    that their students become proficient in what they call Standard 
    American English.  

    Nor is anyone claiming that ebonics be treated like other "second" 
    languages in school.  In many school districts, students for whom 
    English is a "second" language are often taught core subjects in 
    their native tongues.  So, for example, in the southern regions of 
    Texas, where there are large numbers of Hispanic students who 
    primarily speak Spanish, a school system might choose to set up 
    Spanish speaking classes in subjects like math and science, etc.  
    These students would also attend "English as a Second Language" 
    (ESL) classes also, in order for them to become more proficient in 
    English.  But no one not even the OUSD, is suggesting that a 
    school system set up an Ebonics speaking class to teach Ebonics 
    speaking students subjects like math.  

    Ebonics is about money.  Potentially big amounts of money from 
    both the federal government and the state of California.  When the 
    ebonics controversy erupted, the OUSD published a spin control 
    document of epic proportions called "Synopsis of the Adopted 
    Policy on Standard American English." In this document, the OUSD 
    attempts to sound like they aren't going after money by stating 
    that, "Misconceptions [about the policy] include ....  OUSD is 
    only attempting to pilfer federal and state funds." The operative 
    word here is "pilfer," which means to steal.  No, the OUSD is not 
    attempting to steal funds from the state of California and the 
    federal government.  But classifying ebonics as a separate 
    language would, in fact, be a first step in attempting to 
    _qualify_ for funds from the state of California.  They're trying 
    to get the money legally, not illegally.  

    The same OUSD adopted policy recommendation that classified 
    ebonics as a language, also recommended that OUSD participate in 
    an educational program sponsored by the State of California known 
    as the Standard English Proficiency (SEP) program which 
    specifically "promotes English language development for 
    African-American students." S.E.P.  teachers "respect and 
    acknowledge the history, culture, and language that the 
    African-American student brings to school." And OUSD 
    superintendent Carolyn Getridge, as reported in the San Francisco 
    Chronicle, said that the intent of the policy was to show that 
    ebonics speaking students are not wrong for speaking the way they 
    do.  Who would better qualify for S.E.P funding than a school 
    district that embraces ebonics as a legitimate language and 
    explicitly states that they believe their ebonics speaking 
    students are not speaking incorrectly?  Even a high school dropout 
    could see what the OUSD was trying to do.  

    But thanks to the San Francisco Chronicle, the OUSD scheme erupted 
    into a publicity nightmare that ruined any chances it had for 
    qualifying for government money via ebonics.  Within two days 
    after the story broke, the federal Department of Education issued 
    statements indicating that ebonics would not be acceptable 
    justification for receiving federal finds, particularly ESL funds.  
    And the state of California's department of Education issued 
    warnings that it opposed ebonics "if it becomes a way of lowering 
    standards for those students." Even Jesse Jackson, the tireless 
    champion of African-American targeted government programs, had to 
    go on national TV.  and oppose what he called "teaching down" to 
    African-American students.  
                                             
    It's About More Than Just Money:

    If the ebonics controversy were just a thinly veiled attempt at 
    qualifying for government money that went awry, we could all have 
    a good laugh and then move on to the next hot story of the day.  
    But the ebonics controversy is also the latest example of how the 
    civil rights activists are totally reversing the direction they 
    are leading the civil rights movement in.  

    In 1979, there was a landmark court case in Ann Arbor, Michigan 
    that set the precedent for how school districts were required to 
    handle African-American students that did not speak standard 
    English.  Geneva Smitherman, and African-American, was placed in a 
    special education class when she was in the 5th grade because she 
    spoke "black English." But civil rights activists of the day cried 
    foul, opposing the policy.  And the courts ruled in their favor 
    stating that schools could not put African American students in 
    separate classes just because they spoke nonstandard English.  
    Instead, teachers were required to integrate the nonstandard 
    English speaking African-American students into their normal 
    classes and forced teachers to learn how to understand what these 
    students were saying.  

    The court ruling was consistent with the other integration goals 
    of the civil rights movement.  Schools could not be segregated due 
    simply to the location of schools.  Segregation could not be done 
    on a classroom by classroom basis within a school.  And, with this 
    ruling, schools could not segregate African-Americans simply on 
    the basis of their nonstandard English.  And, for the most part, 
    the nation has, over time, embraced the goals of having a fully 
    racially integrated society.  
                                           
    After hearing about the OUSD's policy, Geneva Smitherman was 
    quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle as saying, "Oakland is to be 
    congratulated and celebrated for its vision and its wisdom." 
    Nonetheless, the OUSD policy represents an abandonment of the 
    civil rights movement's integrationist ideals for a to a 
    separatist, African-American centered approach.  
                                           
    OUSD's spin control document stated that the adopted ebonics 
    policy was the result of recommendations from a "broad based Task 
    Force." But the task force commissioned by the school board to 
    come up with these recommendations is the African American Task 
    Force.  Presumably racial diversity is not required in order to be 
    "broad-based" in Oakland.  But regardless of the ethnic make up of 
    the task force, it is clear that the task force believes in 
    promoting the education of African-American students at literally 
    any cost.  In the recommendation overview that the African 
    American Task Force made to the OUSD school board, they 
    recommended that financial commitments be made during the current 
    fiscal year, that "all categorical and general funding be used to 
    ensure access to and mastery of the core curriculum," and that 
    "all resources of the district shall be applied and used to ensure 
    that these recommendations are implemented." In other words, they 
    are telling the OUSD to drop everything else they are doing and 
    make their recommendations, as the school district's top priority.  
    It's not until you read the details of the Task Force's 
    recommendations that you get to the part about recognizing ebonics 
    as a language.  And of course, the other key recommendation that 
    the African American Task Force makes is that they be "retained in 
    order to assist OUSD in developing work plans and implementation 
    strategies." 

    While it may be amusing to contemplate the silliness of 
    recognizing ebonics as a language, the Task Force's 
    recommendations, and the OUSD's adoption of those policies, 
    represents a disturbing shift away from traditional integration 
    goals to a specifically African-American based agenda and 
    reinforces a growing perception among the general public that 
    African-American civic leaders arbitrarily shift between favoring 
    integration and favoring separatism depending on the political 
    expediency of the moment.  
                                             
    How To Defend Ebonics:

    But the motives and strategies of the Task Force would have never 
    come into question and the whole ebonics controversy would have 
    never happened if it weren't for one tiny, troubling fact that 
    school systems are famous for ignoring when devising new education 
    programs.  There isn't a shred of evidence that indicates 
    African-American students will have an easier time learning 
    standard English if ebonics is treated as a separate language.  

    The OUSD would like for you to believe otherwise.  They state that 
    "this language has been studied for several decades" and they 
    offer a bibliography of 20 citations on the study of ebonics and 
    related topics.  But OUSD fails to cite even a single source to 
    justify the educational value of treating ebonics as a language.  

    Instead they have issued statements saying that their policy is 
    "building on the language skills that African-American students 
    bring to the classroom without devaluing students and their 
    diversity" and that "we have directly connected English language 
    proficiency to student achievement." 

    Of course, no learning environment should ever belittle or 
    "devalue" its students.  And the connection between English 
    language proficiency and success in other subjects has been well 
    researched and documented over the years.  

    But that's not the issue raised by the ebonics controversy.  The 
    question at issue is, "Will treating ebonics as a separate 
    language do anything to help students learn standard English?" 

    California's state school's Superintendent, Delaine Eastin, was 
    quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle as saying, "We are not aware 
    of any research that indicates that this kind of program will help 
    address the language and achievement problems of African American 
    students." Federal officials at the Department of Education have 
    made similar remarks.  

    If the OUSD wants to classify ebonics as a separate language, 
    fine.  Let them.  But they should do so within the framework of 
    proving that it is effective, not simply as a ploy to get more 
    government money.  They should put together a scientifically sound 
    experimental program, complete with a control group and prove to 
    the nation that this approach to educating struggling 
    African-American students really works.  If they would do this, 
    the nation would thank them for their initiative and vision rather 
    than ridiculing them.  

    As the OUSD policy stands, it deserves all the ridicule it's been 
    getting precisely because there's no proof whatsoever that it will 
    help and precisely because it smacks of political expediency that 
    runs contrary to the integrationist goals that the entire nation 
    has been struggling toward since the dawn of the Civil Rights 
    movement.  
    
    ====================================
                      Cultural Phenomena                  
    Codependency Rocks!                 
                                             
    Can codependent, dysfunctional relationships serve as a theme for 
    a band's debut album?  The Los Angeles based modern rock band 
    Leather Hyman are betting on it with their first nationally 
    distributed album, Host Body.  It's a tall order to fill.  The key 
    to the success of any album is creating music that people will 
    want to listen to over and over again, so it would seem that Host 
    Body's theme dooms it from the start.  Who wants to listen to 
    lyrics about bad relationships over and over?  But Leather Hyman's 
    mastery of several rock sub-genres, their own experimental sounds, 
    combined with an intellectual, almost literary approach to their 
    lyrics, transforms Host Body from a public therapy session into 
    something the band aptly describes as "a cerebral and cathartic 
    experience." 

    You can tell immediately from looking at the cover art that Host 
    Body is nothing like the typical debut album from a rock band.  
    Usually a band's first CD has a picture of the band looking as 
    cool as they possibly can.  But Leather Hyman chose to forgo the 
    usual narcissism.  Instead we see a painting of a emaciated man 
    being preyed upon my a man sized parasite.  The back cover art 
    shows a woman breast feeding a baby sized tick.  Combine these 
    images with the CD's title, Host Body, and it's obvious this album 
    isn't going to be filled with light, sunny, rock.  

    The CD's title track, "Host Body", reinforces the parasite theme 
    with a heavy metal tribute to paramecia living on our eyeballs and 
    in our blood stream.  Through the heavy guitar power chords and a 
    thundering base, the singer belts out, "They serve me, I serve 
    them/ These tiny one celled creatures are my symbiotic friends./ 
    It makes me think that there's a cosmic plan/ To unite the fates 
    of paramecia and man." But this album isn't really a tribute to 
    parasites.  They serve as a metaphor that keeps reappearing 
    throughout the album.  "Scabs" compares ending relationship to an 
    apparent delousing, "Scratch the scab that covers over/ All my 
    thoughts and feelings for you./ Lick the blood it tastes of iron 
    and lye." From "Rake," "All these blankets made a cocoon/ And you 
    know what that means/ To fly in your sleep/ To see the world from 
    nowhere/ In a dark room to wake with no wings." And lest we think 
    that all the blame lies on the parasitical side of the 
    relationship, there's "Trunk", which shows us that the "host" of 
    the relationship is equally to blame, "Do you remember when you 
    had no mouth?/ I liked you better then./ You lay at my feet, 
    silent and still./ I liked you better then." In "Frank," co-lead 
    vocalist Heather Lockie sings of a boyfriend who's ashamed of his 
    attraction to her, "You loved me but never would/ Tell all the 
    world" and she recommends, in keeping with the lover-as-parasite 
    metaphor, "Antigen for character: `Follow all directions wisely' 
    will cure your allergy." But the fullest expression of these 
    dysfunctional relationships comes from the haunting "Girlfriend" 
    in which Heather sings, "You think I'm your girlfriend/ You think 
    you've got a chance/ You try til it's pathetic./ You won't leave 
    when I ask." 
                                           
    So who are these folks?  What's with the attitude?  Is this 
    another cartoonish Riot Grrrl band?  Are they trying to top Pink 
    Floyd's hopeless fatalism?  With all the downer lyrics about bad 
    relationships with abusive, manipulative significant others, you 
    might think so.  Certainly with a name like "Leather Hyman", 
    (despite the fact that it's Hyman with an "a") you would get the 
    impression that this band's all about sexual frustration, 
    unfulfilled love, and the degeneration of society.  But when asked 
    what the name of their band means, Leather Hyman simply responded, 
    "It's a Spoonerism." 

    A spoonerism, an unintentional interchange of sounds, usually the 
    initial sounds, in two words.  So the band's name is a play on 
    words.  This is key to understanding this band.  Underneath all 
    the angst and downtrodden attitude, Leather Hyman is a band that's 
    smart enough to effectively use a play on words and write lyrics 
    that develop an extended metaphor throughout the album.  There 
    aren't many bands out there that could use the word "antigen" in a 
    lyric to make a point.  Leather Hyman shows that intellect doesn't 
    have to be the death of modern rock.  

    But lyrics don't mean squat if the music's no good.  Leather Hyman 
    doesn't have to worry.  From the high energy drive of the album's 
    opening track, "Million Dollar World" to the closing power chords 
    in "Host Body," it's obvious that Leather Hyman is as accomplished 
    in music as they are with their lyrics.  

    Leather Hyman is a true ensemble band; they know how to put layers 
    and layers of sound together to create a mood.  On "Pussy" and 
    "Away", Heather Lockie plays a viola in spots where you would 
    normally expect to hear a lead guitar riff, creating an almost 
    operatic mood that harkens back to the glam-rock tradition of 
    yesteryear.  And while many bands hide their lack of musicianship 
    behind a wall of noise and distortion, Leather Hyman is not afraid 
    to slow down and simplify like they do in "Frank" and their cover 
    of Lou Reed's "All Tomorrow's Parties" by weaving sounds around 
    Heather Lockie's dreamy, ethereal voice.  But the best expression 
    of Leather Hyman's big, dramatic, ensemble sound is in the 
    haunting "Girlfriend." 

    Even on the tracks that have a more traditional rock format, 
    Leather Hyman is able to add their own unique elements.  For 
    example, "Steve McQueen" has drums and keyboard parts that sound 
    psychedelic, like something you might hear on a Doors album, but 
    combined with the high energy tempo and heavy guitar sound.  The 
    guitar work in "Rake" brings in a 70's funk sound but adds melodic 
    lines from a viola and hi-tech synth effects to give it a unique 
    feel.  But Leather Hyman really puts it all together on "Ritalin," 
    combining Heather's voice, a driving tempo, surfer rock inspired 
    guitar work and drums, and ambient effects to create a track that 
    sounds like it could be the theme music from a Quentin Tarantino 
    movie.  Like all the best rock, "Ritalin" is best enjoyed by 
    playing it as loud as possible while driving down the interstate 
    way, way too fast.  

    Not only is "Host Body" a cerebral and cathartic experience, 
    Leather Hyman has created an CD that dares to be literary and 
    musically inventive while remaining true to its hard hitting rock 
    and roll roots.  

    "Host Body" by Leather Hyman is produced by Frozen Hound 
    Recordings and distributed nationally through Navarre.  Leather 
    Hyman has a web site at http://www.leatherhyman.com/

                              True Story                          
    Charlie                             
                          by David Price                      

    When I was in high school there was a student whose name was 
    Charles Dowdy.  He was 26 years old, yet a sophomore in high 
    school.  He was in a lot of the same classes I was.  

    He was no Forrest Gump; he had a quick mind and a ready wit.  But 
    the mind and wit were housed in one of only 3 parts of his body 
    that were normal size.  Besides his head, there was his left hand 
    and his, er, -well, let's just say he had a normal adult sex 
    drive.  

    His arms and legs were stunted and rather grotesquely twisted, and 
    from neck to toe he had the body of a 3-year-old.  He was 
    permanently confined, of course, to a wheelchair.  He'd lost all 
    that time from school simply because he'd spent so much time in 
    hospitals, but he was BY-GOD-DETERMINED to get his diploma.  

    He worked hard, but had little help.  All the kids shunned him.  
    He couldn't enroll in any of the classes on the second floor, 
    because there was no elevator, and nobody he could rely on to haul 
    him up and down the steps.  

    And his brother had to pay taxi fare to and from school every day 
    because that was the only way he could get there.  The brother, 
    his guardian, was a hard-working, up-and-coming pharmacist, and 
    worked about 12 hours a day.  

    Charlie also needed academic help; he'd gotten as far as he had in 
    part because previous teachers had passed him to higher grades 
    solely out of pity.  He was game, but unprepared.  

    I have to admit to being one of those who shunned him, just 
    because I had no idea how to deal with him.  I happened to mention 
    him to my father one night - laid out the whole story.  I was 
    somewhat distressed that no one would help him.  My father said, 
    "What have YOU done to help him"?  

    "Er - nothing, really".  

    Dad grabbed me off the sofa by my left arm, kicked me in the butt, 
    and said "Well, get the hell around there and do your homework 
    with him.  And you've got a damned car - take him to school".  He 
    only lived just around the circle from us.  Maybe 300 yards.  

    I did those things.  And a lot more.  I helped him wherever he 
    needed to go at school (it was a struggle getting his wheelchair 
    up and down those steps).  I took him to the downtown library.  We 
    started hanging out at Shoney's restaurant over coffee, sometimes 
    for hours at a time.  We went to movies.  We went to malls.  I 
    tried to give him the normal life experiences that the rest of us 
    took for granted.  

    I didn't know what to expect in the way of reaction from the other 
    kids, but I feared that I would be shunned myself.  

    It soon developed that a small group of them would follow us 
    around, and then they started helping him carry his books, and 
    help us up and down the stairs.  We finally worked out a system 
    for the stairs where I would pick him up and carry him in my arms, 
    while someone else carried his books and a third folded up his 
    wheelchair and carried it.  

    I made some pretty close friendships that way.  

    He was a real scamp, too, and it took an awful long time for me to 
    catch on to a running practical joke he played on me.  My car was 
    a 1941 Plymouth 2-door sedan that had a cavernous passenger 
    compartment, and fairly high windows.  When Charlie was sitting on 
    the seat, he was invisible to anyone outside the car, except when 
    he raised his left hand to flick cigarette ashes out the window.  

    He gradually learned all my buttons, and as we rode around town, 
    he'd push them all and goad me into an argument.  We'd fight like 
    brothers.  And I noticed that he smoked more when we were in the 
    car than at any other time.  

    It took months for me to finally say, "Look, every time we get in 
    the car, you pick a fight.  And you smoke like a fiend.  What the 
    Hell's going on"?  He broke up into a cackling fit of laughter 
    that turned his face a brilliant red and almost choked him.  Then 
    he finally caught his breath.  

    "Don't you know by now?  Nobody can see I'm here.  It looks like 
    you're all by yourself.  And you're sitting there arguing at the 
    top of your lungs.  The drivers around you must think you're crazy 
    as Hell"!  

    "And then there's my hand that appears out of nowhere every time 
    there's a car in the right lane.  What do you think they think"?  

    The little bastard.  The next time we went to Shoney's we 
    "borrowed" one of their child's booster seats (under the 
    benevolent eye of the manager) and from then on Charlie was 
    visible and the booster seat was a permanent part of the optional 
    equipment in my car.  

    It was, over those 2-3 years, a lot of effort.  What did I get in 
    return?  A lot of friendship and admiration.  But most important, 
    the honor of wheeling Charlie onstage to receive his diploma at 
    our graduation.  He had made -earned - straight A's our senior 
    year.  

    About the Author 
    
    David Price (definitely NOT the ex-politician of the same name) is 
    a Tar Heel who makes his home in a cow pasture near Commerce, 
    Georgia.  He lives with 1 ancient computer, 1 ancient car, 1 
    ancient pickup truck, 1 not-so-ancient wife, 3 dogs, and an 
    unpredictable but unwieldy number of cats.  He makes his living as 
    a radio announcer in a market about the size of the average 
    thumbnail, and is writing a book about his first love: Eastern 
    Airlines.

    About Stuck In Traffic                    

    Stuck In Traffic is a monthly magazine dedicated to evaluating 
    current events, examining cultural phenomena, and sharing true 
    stories.  

    Why "Stuck In Traffic"?             

    Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an 
    opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the 
    personal to the global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the 
    Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, "Let's consider a reevaluation of 
    the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, 
    the zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible 
    situations, but the best possible situation you could be in.  
    After all, it's exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so 
    much trouble to induce...."
