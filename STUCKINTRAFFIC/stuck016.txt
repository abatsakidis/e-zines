    ====================================
                          Current Events
    Olympic Spirit:  Then and Now

    As the Centennial Olympic Games open in Atlanta, it's fitting to think
    about what makes the Olympic Games special.  Amid all the hype, the
    sponsorships, the news headlines, and the pageantry, it's easy to
    forget why we're holding them in the first place.  The Olympics, after
    all, are far more than just an opportunity to sell T-shirts and
    baseball caps by the millions.

    The history of the Olympics can be traced all the way back to the days
    of ancient Greece, then known as the center of the civilized Western
    world.  So we only know about them through legend and myth.  But the
    ideas behind the Olympics are clear.  Every four years, nations set
    aside their differences and people traveled to Greece to participate in
    games of sport.  Soldiers set down their swords and spears and left the
    battlefield and headed for Greece when the time came.  People who were
    enemies one day suddenly became comrades and competitors in the Olympic
    Games.  Whether this is literally true or not is irrelevant.  That is
    the myth that has survived, that is the archetype in our consciousness.

    The Modern Olympic Games, are quite different and they've lost some of
    that spirit from the Ancient Games.  For one thing, nations don't stop
    their antagonism toward each other for the Olympics.  These modern
    times move far to quickly for that.  The wars continue, the battles
    rage on.  Two countries may be at war with each other while individuals
    from the two countries are peaceably running marathon races against
    each other at the Olympic Games.

    But worse than that even, governments and political activists all
    stripes too often try to use the Olympics to further their political
    goals or make a political statement.  The politically disenfranchised
    have on more than one occasion taken Olympic athletes as hostages,
    interrupting the games, terrorizing the world, and worst of all denying
    innocent people the opportunity to live their dream of Olympic
    competition.  Who can forget the hostage standoff at the Munich games?

    But it's not just the politically disenfranchised that have ruined the
    Olympics in the past.  Governments themselves have done so as well.  On
    more than one occasion, a government has "boycotted" the Olympics by
    forbidding athletes from within its jurisdiction from participating in
    the Olympic events.  The arrogance of such boycotts are stunning, as if
    the boycotting nation were saying, "You can't possibly hold the Olympic
    games without us, so we'll just take our ball and go home."  The United
    States has done this in the past, and the former Soviet Union even went
    so far as to start their own pseudo-Olympic games, called the "Good
    Will Games," in a bald attempt at coopting the Olympics and controlling
    who gets to attend.  The Olympic Organizing Committee does its best to
    prevent the Olympics from becoming a showcase for political statements,
    but the media coverage is just too irresistible for politicos who want
    to get their message out fast.  Every nation on earth has reporters
    covering the Olympics.  There is probably a higher concentration of
    media at the Olympics than any other event on earth.  And where there
    are cameras, you'll find political activists trying to get their
    message out.

    But it's not just the media concentration that threatens to turn the
    Olympics into media showcases for politics.  Part of the problem lies
    in the nature of the modern Olympics themselves.  The modern Olympics
    have been portrayed in the last few decades not as human contests as
    much as national contests.  The image portrayed by the Olympic
    organizers is not one of athletes coming together, but of nation-states
    coming together by sending teams to the Olympics that represent their
    country.  It is a subtle but important difference.

    By treating the athletes not as individuals, but as "teams"
    representing a nation, the nations take center stage.  For example, the
    opening ceremonies always have all the athletes marching into an arena,
    segregated by nation, each marching in under their country's flag.  And
    it is exciting to see all the flags flying.  The pageantry is nice and
    it makes for good TV.  But the athletes tend to get lost in all the
    hoopla.

    It's not just that the national symbols overshadow the individual
    athletes, the Olympic games almost invariably turn into competitions
    between the national teams.  We count the medals that each nation wins
    and compare how many medals "we" have won against the number of medals
    "they" have won.  "They" almost invariably being the nation that we're
    currently at war with or antagonistic with.  The Japanese may be
    whipping our butts in foreign trade and education, but we can beat the
    hell out of them in basketball and we've got the medals to prove it.
    Remember how the everyone in the United States was suddenly a hockey
    fan when it looked like we were going to beat the Evil Empire in this
    particular sport?

    All this is a very sad commentary on the modern Olympics, and we in the
    United States, of all peoples, should know better.  The worst struggles
    in our nation's history, the issues that have caused us the most angst,
    have always centered around the unwise segregation of people for
    arbitrary and inconsequential traits.  The American Revolution was born
    largely out of the belief that "all men are created equal" and that
    one's background, the accident of ones birth, confers no special
    privilege on a person.  No one has the right to rule you just because
    they have "royal blood."  And of course the whole issue of slavery has
    been fundamental in forming our national character.  Almost from the
    very founding of this nation, we have been striving to rid ourselves of
    an institutionalized discrimination based on the accident of one's
    race.  And even though we perhaps haven't quite reached the point where
    we are a "color blind nation," we've made tremendous strides in the
    right direction.

    If we can accept that fact that men and women should be judged not by
    the color of the skin, but by the character of their souls and the
    merit of their accomplishments, is it such a stretch to accept that the
    participants of the Olympic games should judged by their speed, grace,
    and strength instead of the accident of which flag they happened to be
    born under?

    Why is this so difficult for us to do?  Part of the reason is that the
    Olympics appear to be _designed_ to glorify the nation-states instead
    of the individual athletes.  That's why the athletes are segregated by
    race during the opening ceremonies.  That's why the athletes wear their
    national flags on their uniforms.  That's why the winner's national
    anthem is played when the medals are awarded.  That's why the winners'
    national flags are hung from the rafters during the awards ceremonies,
    always with the gold medal winner's flag in a dominant position over
    the second and third place winners' flags.  That's why the medal
    winnings are always reported by nation.  The symbolism of these
    arrangements is unmistakable.

    A more proper way to hold the Olympics, one that would be true to the
    original Olympic spirit, would be to ban all mentions of nationality
    from the games.  The one exception might be for cases where identifying
    nationality would help in the logistics of running the events.  There's
    no reason why the opening ceremonies have to segregate all the athletes
    by nation.  They can march in together, without national flags.  If you
    want the visual pageantry of flags, let them carry the Olympic flag and
    streamers of the Olympic colors.  When medals are awarded at the
    conclusion of an event, it would be more fitting to announce the
    winner's name than to play his or her national anthem.  And I think it
    would be fitting to let the winner address the crowd for a minute or
    two.  I would much rather listen to an athlete say "Hi" to the folks
    back home than to listen to another a national anthem.

    A responsible news organization would not report the tallies of medal
    winnings by country, even if other organizations stooped so low as to
    do so.  A news organization should simply report the names of the
    winners.  It's perhaps reasonable to report where the athlete is from,
    since spectators do tend to be curious about where the winners are
    from.  But it should only be done in the context of painting a picture
    of the individual athlete, helping the spectator get to know a little
    more about the personal side of the athlete.

    The focus of the Olympics should always be on the individual athletes
    because they are the real marvel.  They are the reason we do this.
    They are what's impressive.  It's the dedication a person has to have
    to excel in a sport so well that they qualify for the Olympic games
    that impresses.  Not that they are from a particular country.  The
    Olympics, as the ancients' intended them to be, are symbolic reminders
    of the ability of each and every one of us to transform ourselves
    through sheer force of will.  They show us that we can become "super
    human," or as you prefer, they give us a glimpse of God.

    It's a shame that the modern Olympics games have coopted the spirit of
    the ancient Olympic games and turned them into to a glorification of
    The State.

    ====================================
                              True Story
    The Death of Cool

    There are few things that sadden me more than the death of a good word.

    Ideas, concepts, new ways of looking at the world coalesce from our
    synapses.  The billions of overlapping associations in our head find a
    seed crystal and then slowly clump together in the precipitate of a new
    idea and when that seed crystal grows large enough it emerges into our
    consciousness and we give it a name.  As David Byrne said, we give
    names to things because, "It makes the conversation easy."

    But there are word scavengers in the world that attack language; they
    parasitically attach themselves to new concepts, weighing them down.
    Like a virus, they inject themselves into a concept, mutate it, and
    enter our brains unnoticed.  The Culture War is not a frontal assault,
    it's an indirect attack on the frontal lobes.  It's guerilla war.  It's
    guerilla theater.

    Take, for example, the word "cool."  Cool used to have a distinct
    meaning and a well understood connotation, though these were rarely
    made explicit.  At its root, "cool" means "expressive of a
    personality."  Cool is something that enables a one-on-one interaction.
    Cool is an opportunity for connection.  It's an opportunity for a
    degree of two way communication, even if the parties involved are
    separated by time, or space, or culture.  It's an opportunity for
    insight into the originator.  Cool requires participation from the
    receiver as well as the originator.

    If I say, "That's a cool leather jacket you got there."  I'm
    acknowledging that it is expressive of your personality.  I can relate
    to you through this leather jacket and therefore the jacket has
    coolness.  An object or an idea is cool if it gives you insight into
    the originator's soul.  And by extension, a "cool" person is someone
    who has mastered the art of expressing themselves through the things
    they say, through the things they do, and through the material things
    they own.  But mastering this first requires that you know who you are
    inside.  So a typically uncool person, isn't uncool because of the
    particular things they say or do or have.  A uncool person is not so
    because he or she dresses funny.  An uncool person isn't so because
    they are timid.  An uncool person isn't so because he or she doesn't
    hang out with the "right crowd."  An uncool person is so because they
    aren't in touch with themselves enough to find their personality in
    order to express it.  Coolness requires a person.  Coolness requires a
    personality.

    At least that was so before the word cool was destroyed.

    Cool is essentially an adjective that means "this gives you access to a
    person's soul, or personality."  It didn't take very long for the
    scavengers to latch on to cool as a way of getting inside out heads.
    Pretty soon, the scavengers began to use the word cool to describe all
    kinds soulless ideas.  Attaching the word cool to all sorts of things
    unassociated with a personality was their means of laying a booby trap
    for those of us striving to communicate with each other.  It was a way
    for the scavengers to get in our heads and we willingly let them do it
    because we thought it was an avenue for communication.

    Cool has become little more than a marketing gimmick used by companies
    to grab out attention, drop our defenses, and let them into our heads.
    It's become the modern day equivalent "New and Improved."  There are
    ways to spot this abuse of the term cool, and if you keep them in mind,
    you can avoid falling into the coolness booby trap.

    First, nothing can be cool with out a personality at the other end.
    Cool without soul is not cool at all.  Cool is associated with a
    person, either directly or indirectly with things associated with a
    person.  Cool is not a group effort.  Cool is not corporate.  This is
    not to knock corporations.  Corporations are eminently useful and
    beneficial in their own ways.  But they are not cool.

    Second, cool is never self-descriptive.  While it emanates from a
    person's soul, through their actions and thoughts and creations, it can
    only be applied by the observer.  Anyone describing themselves as
    "cool" automatically isn't.  Anyone describing something they've done
    or bought or created as "cool" automatically isn't.  When a new product
    is introduced into the marketplace and labeled _by_it's_producers_ as
    being "Cool," it automatically isn't.

    While it is possible to avoid the coolness booby trap, I believe it is
    too late to save the word itself.  And so I have vowed to wean myself
    off the word cool.  It's going to be tough to do because the original
    concept is useful, even necessary.  But we will have find another word
    to express the concept.  When, just to name an example, Bill Gates uses
    the term "cool" to describe the products from Microsoft Corporation,
    it's time for the rest of us to find another word.

    ====================================
                      Cultural Phenomena
    "Lead Us Not Into Penn Station"

    Ken Rockwood and Danielle Brancaccio, collectively known as the musical
    duo Professor and Mary Ann, don't need gimmicks to sell their act
    despite the obvious homage to Gilligan's Island.  They don't need
    elaborate orchestrations, mind numbing beats, or walls of amplifiers.
    All they need is an acoustic guitar and their uncanny knack for
    combining quirky, entertaining lyrics with intense, undiluted love.
    Building on this style that they introduced in their previous album,
    "Fairy Tale," Professor and Mary Ann's latest album, "Lead Us Not Into
    Penn Station," is an even stronger collection of songs, both musically
    and thematically.

    Of course everyone is doing the trendy coffeehouse "unplugged" scene
    these days, with varying degrees of success.  No doubt even Metallica
    will give it a try someday soon.  But Professor and Mary Ann are at
    home in it.  Their songs are designed to be listened to, not just
    heard.  And their music gains rather than suffers from the simplicity
    of its orchestration.  And unlike the so many acoustic acts, they
    refuse to be ghettoized into an easily labeled genre.  They are unique
    as well as plain and simple.

    Danielle Brancaccio has the sort of voice that makes voice teachers
    shake their heads, but it also makes men sit up and take notice.  She
    has a breathy, waspy sound that can go from a sophisticated mood
    reminiscent of torch singers from yesteryear to a playful
    man's-best-friend easiness.  Ken Rockwood knows how to write tunes that
    are fun without being too silly and emotional with out being
    embarrassing.  Put the two together and you get songs that sticks in
    your head for days at a time.

    "Lead Us Not Into Penn Station," an obvious pun on the line from the
    Lord's Prayer, "lead us not into temptation," titles both the CD and a
    mini-story contained in the liner notes about urban decay and misery
    which serves as sort of an anti-theme that brings the collections of
    songs together.  The CD opens with Danielle singing "Willow," a
    haunting, gothic inspired song in which she voices everyone's angst and
    incompleteness without love.  And it's followed by "Flea Circus," sung
    by Rockwood, that sets a scene that makes modern city life look
    bewildering and scary.  The stage is then set for the rest of the
    album, all about love and caring, about a woman and man finding solace
    and comfort in their relationship.  These aren't drippy, greeting card
    songs, but they definitely affirm the value of romantic relationships.
    Quite a rare thing in music these days.

    The best of these songs are Danielle's "Make Me Your Baby" and
    Rockwood's "Stumbling Home" in which he manages to perfectly capture
    the contrast between a guy's romantic dreams and reality, "tonight I'm
    going to rest my head in your hands/ going to close my eyes and dream/
    tonight everyone will understand/ exactly what I mean/ tonight I'm
    going to reap the harvest/ that took so long to grow/ But most likely
    tonight I'll just be stumbling home.."

    And true to their "Fairy Tale" tradition, the CD also features "House
    By The Water," a funny blues-inspired song about "marrying a
    millionaire's daughter" and "Luck," good old-fashioned beer-hall
    sing-along song with just the right hint of sad fatalism to balance the
    catchy refrain.

    But as fun as those songs are, the real value in "Lead Us Not Into Penn
    Station," the thing that sets this CD apart from all the rest is its
    unabashed sentimentality.  Pretty strong stuff by today's standards.

    "Lead Us Not Into Penn Station" can found at Tower Records, J&R Music,
    Rebel Music, and Kim's Underground or it can be ordered by mail from
    Bar None Records.  The price is $13.50 for CD.  Send checks to Bar None
    Records.  P.O.B.  1704, Hoboken, NJ 07030.

                              True Story
    Tabula Rasa

    I should just say right up front that no one is to blame except myself.
    Last month I accidently wiped the disk drive on my computer.  The
    details of how I did it are unimportant.  I wasn't paying attention and
    I accidently formatted the wrong drive.  It's conceivable that I would
    have been able to recover the drive even after having formatted it but
    I had spent twenty minutes installing stuff on top of the newly
    formatted drive before I realized what I had done.  So there wasn't
    much sense in trying to recover anything.

    One of the key things lost in this disaster was the subscription list
    to the free e-mail edition of Stuck In Traffic.  So if you used to
    receive Stuck In Traffic via e-mail and didn't get it this month, well,
    now you know why.  Please send me a note and let me know you want back
    on the subscription list.

    It's amazing to me how anti-climatic this disaster was.  It took along
    time for it all to sink in.  What had I lost?  What had I not lost?
    What could be recreated?  What couldn't?

    Thankfully past issues of Stuck In Traffic are archived both on the net
    and on diskette.  And my all my financial data from Quicken is backed
    up on diskette, so that's recoverable.  And I have a printed copy of my
    address book so that's recoverable, although it is a pain in the neck
    to retype it all.

    But it's the little things that I can't recover that I miss the most.
    Things you don't normally think of as being worthy of backing up.  For
    example, I lost two years of journal entries.  Some of them I have
    printed out, but most of them weren't.  What was in them?  I don't
    know.  Stray thoughts.  Practice writing.  Samples opening line from
    essays I intended to write someday.  It's interesting that these things
    don't hold much interest or value when you write them.  They only
    acquire value over time.  I won't feel the pain of losing them until 20
    or 30 years from now.

    I had three years of news articles that I had saved from online news
    services.  Some of it were headline kinds of stories, some of them were
    seeds of ideas for stories.  Again, not something that you use
    everyday.  It's not of any value until you start looking back over
    time.

    Starting all over has been, well, not exactly a good or cathartic
    experience, but it has made me realize the value of having a computer,
    which had never quite sunk in before.  Yes, computers can be wonderful,
    time saving devices, once you master them.  Yes, they can balance a
    checkbook faster than you can.  Yes, e-mail is wonderful.  Yes, the
    world wide web is a fun place to play around.

    But computers also make terrific scrap books.  They are good journals,
    They are good junk drawers.  Maybe that's the best reason of all to
    have them around.

    About Stuck In Traffic

    Stuck In Traffic is a monthly magazine dedicated to evaluating current
    events, examining cultural phenomena, and relating true stories.

    Why "Stuck In Traffic"?
    Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an opportunity
    to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the personal to the
    global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
    Maintenance_, "Let's consider a reevaluation of the situation in which
    we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the zero of consciousness,
    isn't the worst of all possible situations, but the best possible
    situation you could be in.  After all, it's exactly this stuckness that
    Zen Buddhists go to so much trouble to induce...."
