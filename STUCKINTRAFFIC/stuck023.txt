    Can't Stop The Tide
    Campaign finance reform is a hot topic in Washington these days, 
    but will any of the current proposals work? Probably not. All the 
    current proposals are doomed to failure because they focus on 
    the money instead of the power that attracts the money.   
    
    It's The Story, Not The Glitz
    The marketers promoting the "special edition" of the Star Wars 
    trilogy have failed to realize what  makes Star Wars worth 
    seeing again after 20 years.      

    ====================================    
                          Current Events  
    You Can't Stop The Tide             
                                             
    The latest fashion in political scandal is exposing to public view 
    the unseemly contributors to the campaigns on one's political 
    opponents.  Not only is a candidate for office supposed to serve 
    as role model to the world in terms of his public and personal 
    conduct, not only is a candidate supposed to hold himself to a 
    higher standard, candidates are now responsible for the moral 
    character and conduct of contributors to their campaign.  It is 
    guilt by association to the highest degree.  
                                           
    So, for example, if you accept a large campaign contribution from 
    a guy who later turns out to have been an arms dealer who sells 
    arms to your country's enemies, you are supposed to have known 
    this and refused to accept the contribution.  It's a noble goal 
    and certainly one that is feasible up to a certain extent.  If you 
    are going to accept millions of dollars from a particular 
    organization, it would only be prudent to know who you're "getting 
    in bed with" before you accept the money.  But in the heat of a 
    political campaign, where contributions are flowing in from 
    thousands of sources, it's impossible to perform a background 
    check on every single contributor.  There's just no time, 
    especially with small contributions.  
    
    Since a political campaign organization can never fully 
    investigate the background of every contributor, there's always 
    going to be cases where a candidate accepts money from people and 
    organizations with whom he'd rather not be associated.  And it's 
    nearly impossible for a candidate to distance himself from an 
    unseemly contributor after the money has been accepted.  The only 
    thing the candidate can say to the public is, "Hey, I had no idea 
    this contributor was an arms dealer, a child molester, and a tax 
    cheat.  If I had known, I wouldn't have accepted a single penny 
    from him." To which his political opponents can simply respond, 
    "But you should have known." And the candidate's reputation is 
    tarnished in the eyes of the public.  
    
    The bottom line is that campaign finances make for very easy mud 
    slinging.  So Washington's all in a tizzy these days about 
    something called "Campaign Finance Reform." 
                                             
    Getting Back To That `Vision' Thing 
                                             
    Americans have a tremendous capacity for idealism, especially when 
    it comes to political institutions.  It shapes our expectations 
    about what government should be and how it should operate.  One of 
    the most fundamental of our idealistic expectations of government 
    is that the voices of each individual citizen, simple and humble 
    though he may be, are plugged directly in to the decision making 
    process in Washington.  We want our elected representatives to 
    shape their policy and make their decisions based solely on what 
    their individual constituents want.  
      
    It's OK then, for a politician to accept a contribution from the 
    Average American Family.  It's OK to accept contributions from Mom 
    and Pop's Grocery Store, since they are a small business employing 
    regular folks in the district.  What's not OK, it seems, is for 
    people to aggregate their money in political action committees and 
    contribute to political campaigns from PACs.  What's not OK, 
    according to our idealistic vision of government, is for a 
    politician to accept money from contributors outside his district.  
    The public sees this as being "bought out".  These activities 
    represent an interference in the communication between the 
    politician and those who elect him.  Most of the "Campaign Finance 
    Reforms" being proposed are attempts at removing these 
    interferences, but most cause as many problems as they are hoping 
    to solve.  
                                             
    Limiting The Size Of Contributions 
                                             
    The traditional approach to campaign finance reform in the past 
    has been to limit the size of political contributions, both from 
    individuals and corporations.  The exact limits vary depending on 
    whether the political campaign is a federal or state campaign and 
    depending on whether the contributor is an organization or an 
    individual.  But usually the limit is somewhere between one 
    thousand and four thousand dollars.  
        
    These limits are already on the books, well institutionalized in 
    law, and well understood.  Yet there is still a perception that 
    politicians are being bought out with million dollar 
    contributions.  How can this be?  Usually it's because large 
    contributors find ways around the limits by filtering their 
    contributions through multiple "middlemen." Sometimes this 
    filtering is very blatant and direct, like the case where large 
    contributors from the Pacific Rim filtered campaign contributions 
    to the Clinton campaign through members of Buddhists temples in 
    California.  Sometimes the filtering is more subtle.  Sometimes 
    it's not a matter money laundering, but simple collusion.  A large 
    PAC or organization can simply decide which candidate to support 
    and then each of the constituent members of the organization 
    dutifully, but independently make the maximum contribution they 
    are allowed.  Money doesn't actually flow through the 
    organization, it's more like a cartel where individual members 
    trust each other to abide by the decision of the group.  
        
    It's very difficult, perhaps impossible, to stop this sort of 
    collusion.  But some reformers are proposing even lower limits to 
    campaign contributions anyway.  It's like the king, who upon 
    hearing that all his horses and all his men couldn't put Humpty 
    Dumpty back together again, told his court, "that just says to me 
    that I need more horses and more men." Campaign contribution 
    limits are flawed in concept, not in degree.  
        
    Furthermore, lowering the campaign contribution limits any further 
    would begin to affect grassroots politicians who really do raise 
    their money in small contributions.  While the grassroots 
    politician is still going to get most of his contributions in 
    increments under a hundred dollars, there are going to be a few 
    individuals willing to contribute up to current limits.  If these 
    limits are lowered, the grassroots candidate is going to suffer.  
    And the grass roots candidate is not going to be able to set up 
    money filtering schemes with his small budget.  But organizations 
    that want to pump millions of dollars into a campaign have the 
    incentive to invest in ways to circumvent the limits.  So it's 
    likely that lowering contribution limits any further would 
    actually hurt the grass roots candidate more than they would hurt 
    the candidates that depend on PACs and big organizations.  
                                             
    Limiting The Origins Of Contributions 
                                             
    Another approach to Campaign Finance Reform being proposed is to 
    limit contributions to a candidate's campaign to individuals that 
    live in the candidate's district.  Obviously this is an unpopular 
    proposal among politicians whose districts do not represent a very 
    high concentration of wealth.  Poorer districts will have less 
    vigorous campaigns.  Wealthier districts will receive all the 
    attention from PACs and other large contributors.  You can bet 
    there is a lot more money dedicated to PACs and campaigning in New 
    York City than there is in the deserts of Nevada.  So trying to 
    restrict contributions by geography puts some politicians at a 
    disadvantage to others and doesn't solve the fundamental problem.  
                                           
    And more importantly, limiting contributions by geography is a 
    clear violation of free speech protection guaranteed by the 
    Constitution because elected officials often make policy decisions 
    that affect more people than just those in their district.  For 
    example, Jesse Helms is the ranking Senator from North Carolina, 
    but as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he makes 
    decisions that affect the entire country every day.  Suppose you 
    didn't approve of Helms' advocated policy with regard to Cuba.  
    Shouldn't you be allowed to contribute to his opponent's campaign 
    even though you don't live in North Carolina?  
                                           
                                             
    Elimination of Soft Money 
                                             
    The so called "soft money" concept is one of the biggest scams 
    ever perpetrated on the American people.  The scam works like 
    this.  In order to avoid appearances of impropriety, PACs and 
    other large organizations do not contribute directly to an 
    individual candidate.  Instead, they contribute to the candidate's 
    political party.  Contributions to political parties are called 
    "soft money" because they are, by law, not spent on individual 
    candidates but on the party's business.  In other words, they are 
    contributions to the ideals and agenda.  But the Democrats and 
    Republicans have shown over and over again that their principles 
    and agenda are as much for sale as individual politicians are.  A 
    PAC is not going to contribute a large amount of soft money unless 
    it has some assurance, perhaps only informally, that the money 
    will be spent in a manner that favors the candidates that it 
    supports.  So, for example, the Democratic party can run 
    television commercials selling the voters in a particular district 
    on the merits of a tax increase and indirectly support the 
    Democratic candidate in that district who is running on a platform 
    that calls for tax increases.  
        
    The problem with the soft money approach is that it removes the 
    appearance that the candidate has sold out to a PAC, but at the 
    same time it increases the candidate's obligation to the leaders 
    of the party and it's political machine.  The candidate's 
    incentive is to suck up to the party machinery rather than to 
    represent the people in his district.  But since "soft money" is 
    perfectly legal, the candidate can claim to have not "sold out." 
        
    So some reformers have proposed "the total elimination of soft 
    money." But this proposal has even thornier free speech 
    implications.  Since the whole idea behind a political party, in 
    theory anyway, is to serve as a focus point for representing 
    principles in public debate and putting those principles into 
    action.  Any limitation on political party contributions would be 
    a limitation on entering the "marketplace of ideas" and 
    participating in public debate.  
                                             
    Public Financing Of Campaigns 
                                             
    Of all the campaign finance reforms being proposed, public 
    campaign financing is the most fundamentally flawed and the most 
    short sighted.  The idea is that since it costs so much money to 
    run an election campaign, politicians are "forced" to accept 
    contributions from PACs and other big dollar organizations because 
    out of necessity.  So if the candidates are allowed to spend 
    taxpayer money for their campaigns, they won't sell themselves to 
    the highest bidder.  
        
    The first problem with this scheme is that there's nothing to stop 
    a politician from tapping into both the public treasury and 
    contributions from others.  And since the politicians themselves 
    control the spending, it would be like giving them a blank check 
    to do whatever they want with tax payers' money.  
        
    And giving them a blank check to spend on their campaigns would be 
    even further complicated by the fact that they are also the ones 
    that will decide who qualifies for tax payer funds.  You can bet 
    your bottom dollar that the rules for "qualifying" for tax payer 
    funding of a campaign will favor the incumbents in a race, since 
    the incumbents will be the ones writing the rules.  So public 
    financing has a huge potential to stifle competition in elections 
    rather than increase it.  
        
    But even if politicians had hearts of gold, even if their 
    reputations were above reproach, financing election campaigns with 
    tax payer money would still be a bad idea because it totally 
    destroys one of the fundamental checks on power in our government.  
    It removes the accountability politicians have to the people who 
    elect them.  The accountability an elected official has toward his 
    constituents comes not just from the fact that they cast votes for 
    him, but from the fact that his constituents support him during 
    the campaign.  If a candidate for office, did not have to raise 
    money from his constituents, campaigns would degenerate into 
    competitions about which candidate will get the government to 
    spend the most on the district.  Under public financing of 
    campaigns, votes will be bought instead of earned.  
                                             
    Fixing The Problem 
                                             
    In order to effectively reform how campaigns are financed, we must 
    first recognize and accept the fact that money and power go 
    together.  Money naturally flows to wherever power is 
    concentrated.  Trying to invent ways to block money from flowing 
    from special interest groups and PACs into the hands of 
    politicians is only treating the symptoms of the problem without 
    addressing the fundamental issue.  You might as well try to stop 
    the tide.  
        
    If one accepts the fact that money flows to politicians in 
    proportion to the power they hold, then the solution is obvious.  
    Their power as individuals must be diluted.  
        
    There are two main ways to dilute the power of an individual 
    politician.  First, we can decrease the size of districts so that 
    there are more elected individuals in the governing bodies.  Some 
    representatives will still hold more power than others.  For 
    example, the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee will 
    hold more power than representatives that are not on the committee 
    at all.  But in general, the more votes that are cast on an issue, 
    the harder it becomes to buy enough politicians to ensure the 
    outcome you want.  The Founding Fathers of this country understood 
    this concept and this is why they fixed the size of districts when 
    they wrote the Constitution.  As originally written, the 
    Constitution called for the number of representatives to increase 
    as the population of the country increased.  It wasn't until this 
    century that the Constitution was modified so that the number of 
    representatives is fixed.  Thus as the population of the country 
    increases, their power increases.  
        
    While decreasing the size of districts and increasing the number 
    of elected representatives would be an effective way to dilute the 
    power of individual politicians, most Americans would feel 
    uncomfortable, if not queasy, at the thought of having more 
    politicians running around.  But the second way to dilute the 
    power of individual politicians is more palatable, if more 
    difficult to implement.  Governing power needs to devolve from the 
    higher levels of government down to the lower ones.  It is much 
    more difficult for special interest groups to buy the legislatures 
    of all fifty states than it is to buy key committees in the 
    federal legislative branch of government.  It is much more 
    difficult for a PAC to buy out all the county commissions across a 
    state than it is to buy a state legislature.  
        
    It will be a difficult task to wrest away power from legislators 
    and give it back to the lower levels of government.  But it will 
    be easier than trying to stop the flow of money into their 
    pockets.  Politicians won't stop being bought until they are no 
    longer worth buying.

    ====================================    
                      Cultural Phenomena  
    It's The Story, Not The Glitz 
                                             
    With the punctuality of a digital clock, last month's release of 
    the Star Wars special edition trilogy was perfectly preceded by a 
    publicity campaign.  C3PO himself could not have timed it better.  
    Interviews, TV specials, and sales promotions have permeated 
    pop-culture the past couple of months, all hyping the release of 
    the special edition of Star Wars.  
      
    But why would anyone care?  Why go see this movie again?  
        
    To hear the publicicists tell it, the reason we need to see Star 
    Wars again is that there is "a whole generation" of people who 
    have never had the pleasure of watching Star Wars on a big theater 
    screen.  Fair enough.  Just as Disney re-releases its classics for 
    new generations of kids, it would seem reasonable for a movie that 
    has wedged itself deep into our pop culture to be rereleased every 
    now and then.  
        
    But unlike Disney, the marketing types behind Star Wars haven't 
    spent so much time trying to portray Star Wars as a classic, like 
    it deserves.  Instead, they have portrayed the re-release of Star 
    Wars as an _update_ to the original.  Previously cut scenes have 
    been added back, the special effects have been enhanced and 
    cleaned up, and the sound track has been totally rerecorded and 
    enhanced.  We are teased and tantalized in commercials with 
    glimpses at all the new stuff and this is supposed to be the 
    reason why we'll shell out another six or seven dollars to go see 
    Star Wars yet again.  
        
    To give credit where credit is due, the special edition release of 
    Star Wars lives up to its special effects promise.  The soundtrack 
    is much crisper, there seems to be more variety in the types of 
    sounds the various machinery makes, especially the guns.  The big 
    guns make big sounds and the small guns make small sounds.  
    There's much more color in the special effects also.  The light 
    saber fight scenes in particular have a richer glow to them.  
        
    The added scenes, for better or worse, do not contribute to the 
    story in any significant way.  There's a bit more elaboration on 
    the empire's pursuit of the two `droids, which seem to have been 
    added for no other reason than to allow the special effects guys 
    to past in some computer generated dinosaur like things that they 
    use as mounted transportation.  
                                           
    There's an added scene between Han Solo and Jabba that duplicates 
    almost word for word an earlier scene between Han and one of 
    Jabba's underlings.  Again, there's no apparent need for this 
    scene other than the chance it gives the effects guys to show us 
    that yes, in fact, Jabba can move.  
                                           
    The one added scene that contributes to the story is a meeting 
    between Luke and his best friend Biggs who joined the Rebellion a 
    year before Luke did.  Not only do you get a glimpse of Luke as a 
    real Person instead of a mythic figure, it establishes the fact 
    that Luke is capable of flying a fighter, something that always 
    bothered be about the original.  
                                           
    But even with all the polishing up, Star Wars still looks dated by 
    today's standards.  And if the techno-wonks behind the scenes 
    wanted to bring Star Wars up to today's standards for special 
    effects, they failed miserably.  There's just to much that can't 
    be fixed.  Darth Vadar's mask, for example, still looks like it's 
    some sort of discarded car part from a junk yard.  The storm 
    troopers still look remarkable stiff and silly.  There's still a 
    shot in the cantina scene where you can peer straight through one 
    of the alien's mask.  And those 70's era haircuts still look out 
    of place for a galaxy far, far away.  
        
    In other words, all the add ons are just glitz.  Instead of taking 
    the high road, instead of portraying Star Wars as a classic fairy 
    tale born in a new era, instead of portraying Star Wars as a 
    classic to be cherished in its original, the marketers behind Star 
    Wars have added a heavy layer of marketing glitz that the movie 
    simply doesn't need.  Even the original characters have undergone 
    extensive makeovers wherever possible.  The new movie posters give 
    the Princess more curves than she ever had in the original movies, 
    the New Luke looks more like a lean mean fighting machine than the 
    naive, idealist that the original Luke.  And Chewbacca looks like 
    a walking advertisement for a hair products commercial, complete 
    with color highlighting in his well groomed hair.  
                                           
    What makes the added glitz even more ironic is that it's the 
    _dirt_ that partly makes Star Wars seem so believable.  Watching 
    Star Wars on a TV screen, you lose much of the detail from the big 
    screen.  On TV, Star Wars looks like so many other futuristic 
    sci-fi movies where everything is well lit, clean, and utopian.  
    But on the big screen you see all the details and the details you 
    see are dirt.  The droids especially stumble through the movie, 
    beat up, scratched, dented, and covered with grit.  Han's ship 
    _is_ a piece of junk, and the Rebellion is obviously operating on 
    a shoestring budget, to say the least.  All these details add to 
    the feeling that Star Wars is set in desperate times.  
        
    And it's the sense of desperation that sets the stage for Star 
    Wars, not the special effects.  Amid the desperation arises "A New 
    Hope" as the movie's episode title tells us.  
        
    New hopes rising out of desperate times is a classic theme in all 
    story telling, especially when the New Hope arises from unexpected 
    places and unexpected people.  If the team behind Star Wars has 
    forgotten this, the public at least has not.  This is why Star 
    Wars will forever be one of the classics in movie making and big 
    effects movies like Independence Day and Twister are doomed to 
    obscurity.  
        
    Let's face it.  Star Wars would not have been the big hit that it 
    was if Luke was just another guy who managed to find his way off a 
    poor, unimportant planet to a more lucrative career in smuggling.  
    Star Wars would have been a dead end movie if Princess Leia had 
    been just another pretty bimbo working her way up the diplomacy 
    food chain by blasting anyone who wouldn't sleep with her.  Star 
    Wars wouldn't have deserved a second visit if Han Solo and 
    Chewbacca were just scruffy looking mutineers out to make a quick 
    buck.  Star Wars would not be so inspiring if Darth Vadar wasn't 
    so evil.  And what's the point of having androids in a movie if 
    they don't also portray some human element?  
        
    It's too bad that the Star Wars team couldn't have also spent some 
    time polishing up the story.  Because where the special effects 
    and techno wizardry where great for its time and could not be 
    improved much for the special edition release, one wishes that the 
    story line of Star Wars could have been beefed up a little, 
    polished here and there.  
        
    Yes, Star Wars tells a classic fairy tale of good vs.  evil.  And 
    one of the key reasons Star Wars succeeded is that the Good Guys 
    won in a era of movie making obsessed with blurring the 
    distinction between good and evil and moral ambiguity reigns.  But 
    it's kinda thin in the plot department.  The term "cardboard 
    character" could have been invented for this movie.  How, for 
    example, did Leia get caught up in the Rebellion?  Where did she 
    come from?  What's her grudge against the Empire?  Why exactly is 
    there a civil war in the first place?  Unlike most movies of good 
    vs.  evil, the evil Empire is actually the revolutionary movement 
    and the Rebellion and the Imperial Senate represent the good and 
    the status quo of the institutions.  It's easy enough to hate 
    Darth Vadar since he sounds ominous, dresses in black, and always 
    wears a mask, just like every villain in history.  But it would be 
    nice to know a little more specifically just why we are supposed 
    to hate him.  And Luke, poor Luke, hero of the whole shooting 
    match, how did you learn the ways of The Force in a mere couple of 
    hours?  
        
    But no matter, Star Wars can't be changed.  It's a thin story, but 
    it's the right story.  All the necessary elements, no matter how 
    thinly constructed, are there in the plot to touch the romantic, 
    idealist in all of us.  And that's what makes Star Wars worth 
    seeing again after 20 years.  Let's hope that George Lucas doesn't 
    forget this in the next trilogy.  Stuck In Traffic

                  About Stuck In Traffic 
        
    Stuck In Traffic is a monthly magazine dedicated to evaluating 
    current events, examining cultural phenomena, and sharing true 
    stories.  
      
    Why "Stuck In Traffic"?  
        
    Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an 
    opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the 
    personal to the global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the 
    Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, "Let's consider a reevaluation of 
    the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, 
    the zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible 
    situations, but the best possible situation you could be in.  
    After all, it's exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so 
    much trouble to induce...."
