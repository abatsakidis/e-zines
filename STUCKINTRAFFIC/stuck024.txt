    ====================================    
                      Cultural Phenomena   
        
    David Lynch Crosses The Road        
                                             
    Question: Why did David Lynch cross the Lost Highway?  Answer: To 
    get to The Other Side.  
      
    David Lynch is back.  And with his new movie, Lost Highway, he's 
    more David Lynch than ever before.  
      
    Over the years Lynch has developed a reputation for pulling and 
    picking at those tiny stray threads in the fabric of society and 
    managing to unravel far more than anyone would have guessed.  Even 
    his early works like Eraserhead and The Elephant Man, Lynch has 
    been preoccupied finding the bizarre hidden in the absolutely 
    normal.  But it was perhaps his 1986 film, Blue Velvet, that Lynch 
    perfected this uncanny ability.  Starting with a perfectly normal 
    suburban setting in a small town, Lynch introduces a single loose 
    thread, a human ear found on the side of the road, and proceeds to 
    pick at it until he has exposed an intricate web of murder, sex, 
    and mystery.  
      
    Lynch mastered this new form of story telling so well that it was 
    developed into a wildly popular TV show, Twin Peaks, in which a 
    murder investigation served as a thin excuse for Lynch to explore 
    this theme over and over again in each episode.  Who is BOB?  Why 
    are the owls always watching?  Why does the one-armed man write 
    poems about walking "with fire"?  Over and over again, we get 
    fleeting glimpses of mystery, but we never quite get to figure it 
    all out.  
      
    But it's not just a matter of uncovering crime or mayhem that 
    Lynch seems to be fascinated by.  When David Lynch digs, he digs 
    into our psyches.  The hidden mysteries that he's so good at 
    unraveling always seem to point to the dark side of ourselves.  
    The part we'd just as soon not get to know too well.  The side of 
    ourselves that we hope the Rotary Club never finds out about.  Is 
    the murderer in Twin Peaks a supernatural ghost?  Is the murderer 
    a demon in our psyche?  Is there a difference?  
                                           
    Up to this point in his career, David Lynch has always brought us 
    tantalizingly close to showing us the other side of normal.  With 
    Lost Highway, he finally crosses over to the other side and in 
    some sense the whole movie is a struggle to get _back_ to reality.  
      
    Lost Highway's opening credits show a driver's seat view of 
    driving very fast down a long stretch of desert highway at night.  
    The camera's attention is focused on the blur of yellow lines 
    marking the lanes as the speed by.  But if you notice very 
    carefully, there are not one, but two sets of highway lane lines 
    flying by under the car.  What's going on?  Blurred double vision?  
    Two cars seeing the same thing?  If so, how can they be driving in 
    exactly the same spot?  
      
    This serves as a theme throughout the movie.  Over and over again, 
    we get hints at double lives, double identities, multiple 
    personalities, multiple aliases.  
      
    The film starts out in a fairly standard way, we're introduced to 
    Fred Madison, a successful jazz musician played by Bill Pullman 
    and his wife Renee', played by Patricia Arquette.  They live in a 
    trendy yet disturbingly dark house in what is apparently Los 
    Angeles.  From the moment we lay eyes on both of them, you know 
    there's trouble in the marriage.  Fred knows, and we know, that 
    Renee' is hiding something from her husband, but what?  Is she 
    having an affair?  Maybe, but the expression in her eyes doesn't 
    seem to be that of betrayal.  Whatever she's hiding, it's more 
    than just infidelity.  
      
    In addition to being stressed about his marriage, Fred has to deal 
    with the fact that he and his wife are being stalked by someone.  
    First, someone leaves a message for Fred on the front door 
    intercom, simply saying, "Dick Laurent is dead." It's unclear if 
    Fred knows who Dick Laurent is or who's leaving the message.  
    Unsettling.  But the big trouble starts when someone starts 
    leaving video tapes on the front porch showing the inside of the 
    Madison's house and pictures of him and his wife sleeping in bed.  
      
    The stress from these events and his crumbling marriage cause 
    Frank to start imagining things, like seeing the face of a Mystery 
    Man (Robert Blake) on his wife's face instead of hers.  But it 
    soon becomes more than just a bad case of nerves when the Mystery 
    Man show up at a party that the Madison's are attending and 
    proceeds to demonstrate to Fred an unnatural ability to be in two 
    places at once.  
      
    Clearly, the movie has crossed over to the supernatural.  But just 
    barely.  It's _possible_ that the mystery man is has just 
    concocted an elaborate parlor trick.  You keep thinking that if 
    you just knew a little bit more about who the Mystery Man is, what 
    Renee' is hiding, who the stalker is, you might make sense of it 
    all and the movie will be just a mystery movie instead of a horror 
    movie.  But make no mistake about it, Lost Highway is a horror 
    movie.  
      
    But it's not like the stereotypical horror movie.  With the 
    exception of one scene, there's no gratuitous gore or violence.  
    It's the bad dream variety of horror movie.  A nightmare.  And 
    like the most disturbing dreams, you get the feeling it's trying 
    to tell you something, but you can't quite figure it out.  The 
    movies end leaves you with that terrible feeling you get when you 
    wake up from a bad dream with too many questions unanswered and 
    wishing you had endured the bad dream just a little bit longer so 
    that it might have made sense, somehow.  
      
    This movie is not for people who insist that all the plot threads 
    be neatly sewn up at the end.  After seeing Lost Highway, there's 
    going to be more loose ends than when you started.  Sorry.  Deal 
    with it or don't go see the movie.  
      
    But if you can deal with unanswered questions, if you can deal 
    with bad dreams, if you can deal with staring into the face of the 
    devil himself, go see Lost Highway.  From its opening credits 
    until the very last frame, David Lynch proves that he is a master 
    at making you _want_ to explore the horror.  
      
    ====================================  
                              True Story                          
    Recycling Paralysis                 
                                             
    As usual, I blame the government.  
        
    It all started innocently enough.  It was late February and I 
    finally got started on my Spring Cleaning (for 1994 that is.) The 
    impetus was doing my yearly homage to the IRS.  For once, I 
    thought I'd not wait until the last second to do my taxes, be a 
    good citizen, and all that stuff.  So early one rainy Sunday 
    morning, after ingesting enough caffeine to have some reasonable 
    hope of being able to add and subtract, I started fumbling around 
    my office, looking for all my tax forms.  That's when the trouble 
    began, and if it hadn't been for the government's insistence on 
    taxes, I'd have never gotten into the mess I managed to create.  
      
    Now, my finances are not too complicated.  I've got the usual 
    checking and savings account.  A W-2 form that reports my salary.  
    Some company stock, a small mutual fund, and the home mortgage.  
    So it's usually not to difficult to gather up all the paperwork 
    needed to do my taxes and the government is oh so friendly about 
    sending my tax forms every year.  
                                           
    I keep all my financial papers in a gray file box.  With each sort 
    of paper in it's own folder.  But somewhere around June of last 
    year my file box filled up.  You would think that there's always 
    room for one more piece of paper, and I had been operating under 
    this assumption for quite sometime.  But then about June, the 
    assumption proved to be false.  Nothing else was going into the 
    file box until something came out.  
       
    Inconvenient.  So instead I began to stack all my financial papers 
    on top of the file box, perhaps subconsciously hoping that the 
    contents of my file box would somehow settle or further condense, 
    or maybe decompose enough to allow me to file more papers in it.  
    No such luck I'm afraid.  
                                           
    So for eight months, papers had been piling up precariously on top 
    of my file box and when I began digging through them to find all 
    the stuff I needed to do my taxes, they spilled off the file box, 
    behind the desk, and onto the floor.  "Time to do something about 
    that file box," I said to myself, "gotta get this stuff 
    straightened out before I can do my taxes." Mistake number one.  
      
    Faced with the stark reality that no more papers were going into 
    the file box until some came out raised an interesting challenge.  
    I had dealt with this challenge once before, several years ago.  
    And I had a vague recollection that I started storing the really 
    old papers in a cardboard box in the back of the closet in my 
    office.  Maybe, just maybe, there was some more room in that box 
    to which I could add some of the papers from my file box of 
    current financial papers.  
       
    The problem is that in my office closet, there were no less than 
    12 cardboard boxes, all labeled ambiguously at best.  There was 
    nothing to do except start hauling them out one by one, opening 
    them up and looking inside.  
      
    Nothing new about this phenomena; Pandora had the same problem.  
    Every time I opened a box, stuff leaped out and spread itself all 
    over my office.  Ancient issues of my favorite magazines found 
    there way onto my already over crowded desk to be reread and 
    reviewed.  Ancient issues of my not so favorite magazines piled up 
    on the floor, as did all my old college text books.  Ancient 
    extension cords and telephone wires and various cable converters 
    snaked their way across the floor.  Printer ribbons from long lost 
    printers appeared out of nowhere.  Various seemingly important 
    computer parts escaped showed up, rasing interesting questions 
    about the state of my computer.  
      
    For the record, I did in fact find the box I was looking for.  It 
    did in fact have some spare capacity to hold more old papers.  But 
    by the time I found it, all this was irrelevant.  There was no 
    room in my office to do any work.  There was no place in my office 
    to lay anything down without fear of losing it forever.  
      
    "Time to do a little Spring Cleaning," I said to myself, "better 
    get rid of some of this stuff and get the rest organized." Mistake 
    number two.  
      
    Sort first, ask questions later has always been my basic strategy 
    to cleaning.  But sorting takes a lot of room, so I began hauling 
    everything out of the office into various other rooms in the 
    house.  All my important financial records and stuff like that 
    went to the kitchen table, since that's the traditional place that 
    I do my taxes.  Magazines, newspapers, and other clippings were 
    piled up on the living room coffee table since that's where all 
    the current editions of such things pile up.  Fiction books went 
    to the bedroom's bedside table so that they could be reconsidered 
    for future nighttime reading.  Nonfiction books and all hardware 
    went to the guest bedroom because, well just because there was no 
    place else in the house to pile them.  
      
    At this point, I wasn't yet panicked.  I knew that I had a 
    somewhat serious problem on my hands, but I figured that if I just 
    got rid of a few of the nonessentials, I'd be able to put it all 
    back together again.  So the fireplace hearth was designated as 
    the trash pile/recycling pile.  You know, "ashes to ashes, dust to 
    dust." I dunno, it seemed appropriate somehow, or maybe just 
    wishful thinking.  
      
    So I spent an entire Sunday wandering from room to room in my 
    house, working on a little bit here and a little bit there.  And 
    slowly but surely my trash pile began to accumulate papers, and 
    books, and broken appliances and odd scraps of metal, and even a 
    broken chair or two.  I was encouraged.  This was going to be 
    good.  Eventually I would be glad I had done this.  Or so I 
    thought.  But while the various sections in my house were showing 
    signs of promise, I didn't notice until it was too late that my 
    trash/recycling pile was developing a critical mass.  Spontaneous 
    combustion was beginning to look like a possibility.  And as I 
    contemplated this new development in front of the fireplace, I 
    couldn't help notice the clock above the hearth.  4:30pm.  
       
    Now I have no idea how I knew this.  I suspect a supernatural 
    influence.  But somehow I just knew that the town dump closed at 
    5:00pm.  "Better get this stuff loaded in the car and head out to 
    the dump," I told myself, "or I'm gonna be living with this trash 
    for a while." Mistake number three, but who's counting?  
      
    The car I drive, an Acura Integra, as much as I enjoy it, is not 
    designed for hauling.  It's designed to be a reasonably priced 
    sports car.  The trunk room is limited and you can't get anything 
    very large into the doors.  Nonetheless, I managed to get about 8 
    garbage bags of trash (about half of what I had accumulated so 
    far), a couple of boxes of books, and the broken chair into my 
    car.  
      
    At 4:50pm I arrived at the dump.  After proving that I was a 
    resident of my Town, the gatekeeper let me enter the dump drop off 
    area.  Now, dumps aren't what they used to be.  For one thing, you 
    never actually get to see the dump.  Instead you are allowed into 
    sort of a dump staging area where you unload all your stuff from 
    your car into various huge tractor trailer sized dumpsters.  And 
    everything has to be sorted just right to make maximum use of 
    recycling.  
      
    I've never been that enthusiastic about recycling.  Not that I 
    disapprove of it or anything, but I just can't get excited about 
    it.  So whenever I see one of those public service announcements 
    on TV, trying to inform me about how to recycle, my eyes tend to 
    glaze over and I switch the channels.  I have know idea what "chip 
    board" is.  I only vaguely understand the difference between 
    glossy paper and recyclable paper.  So I was a little intimidated 
    by the dump's drop off area.  There was a dumpster for yard waste.  
    There were dumpsters for glass.  (Segregated into clear, brown, 
    and green glass.) There was a dumpster for scrap lumber and a 
    dumpster for scrap metal.  There was a dumpster for plastic.  And 
    thank goodness there was an old-fashioned dumpster for just 
    regular trash like stuff.  It was reassuring somehow.  
      
    The easy stuff went first.  Trash bags into the trash dumpster.  I 
    confess that there might have been some recyclable paper in those 
    trash bags.  But I was concerned about this broken chair I was 
    trying to get rid of.  It didn't exactly qualify as "trash" 
    because it wasn't in a trash bag.  And it was neither lumber nor 
    scrap metal.  It was combination of all three.  Recycling 
    paralysis had struck.  I wanted to do the right thing, but had no 
    idea.  
      
    Time to consult the dump attendant.  Nice guy.  Really.  I have no 
    complaints about him.  I rolled the chair over to his guard 
    station by the entrance.  And asked him what I could do about this 
    chair.  He looked it over, quite carefully and then gave me his 
    analysis.  "I better take care of it" he said, rolling his eyes.  
    I have no idea what ever happened to that chair, but I suspect 
    that Superfund money was used to dispose of it properly.  
      
    In any event, all I had left to deal with were the books.  Stacks 
    and stacks of ancient paperback books.  Which dumpster should the 
    books go in?  Not being bagged up in trash bags, I couldn't dump 
    them in the trash dumpster without flagrantly violating the rules 
    in front of God and everybody else.  My next best hope seemed to 
    be the paper recycling bin.  But when I peered inside, it didn't 
    seem to contain any books, just loose paper.  And there was this 
    big sign that said, "No Telephone Books!" Stumped again.  I didn't 
    know what to do.  
      
    About that time, the attendant walked over to my car.  Apparently 
    he wanted to help me out so he could close up for the night.  So I 
    asked him, "Can these books be recycled?" And in a voice that 
    approached the smugness only found in National Park Rangers, he 
    informed me that paperback book covers were not recyclable.  "Can 
    they be thrown in the trash?" I asked timidly.  "You're going to 
    throw away _books_?" 
      
    No.  No.  Of course not.  I was just curious.  It was only a 
    hypothetical question.  In any event, I left the dump and headed 
    back home, with two boxes of books still in tow, like a modern day 
    albatross around my neck.  When I got home, I briefly considered 
    the possibility of storing these boxes of books in my garage.  But 
    the fact of the matter is that I'm afraid, very afraid, of what 
    might be in my garage.  I've gotten to the point that I walk 
    straight from the car to the door without casting my eyes to far 
    to either side.  Somethings are simply best left undisturbed.  
                                           
    So here I sit, in a house full of chaos, amid a pile of garbage 
    bags and books I can't seem to get rid of, thoroughly paralyzed 
    with a fear of recycling, dreading the day I'm going to have to 
    explain in Tax Court why my taxes were never filed.  
      
    
    ==================================== 
                          Current Events                      
    Life Aint What It Ewes To Be?       
                                             
    When scientists announced that they had successfully cloned a ewe, 
    it sent shockwaves through the world media.  "Dolly," as the 
    female sheep was dubbed, was an instant star and appeared on just 
    about every newscast worldwide.  
      
    If Dolly had been just another breeding program designed to help 
    Scottish herders to raise hardier sheep that produced more wool, 
    the story wouldn't have been circulated beyond the the front cover 
    of husbandry trade journals.  The reason that Dolly's story struck 
    such a nerve around the world is that no one could offer any 
    reason that cloning couldn't be accomplished with humans.  
      
    All the scientists involved in the Dolly project were quick to 
    issue statements that it would be exceedingly difficult to do the 
    same thing with human DNA.  But somehow they failed to convince 
    the world.  Whether because journalists simply didn't want to hear 
    this because it ruined the sensationalism of the story, or whether 
    there really isn't a reason that humans can't be cloned, only time 
    will tell.  
      
    For better or worse, the world events triggered by the Dolly 
    announcement have marched forward unabated with the assumption 
    that the same process could eventually apply to humans.  
      
    Journalists have incited much hand-wringing over the whole issue, 
    injecting horror stories of people being cloned for their organs, 
    of growing people in vats of chemicals, of creating unhuman humans 
    in a Frankensteinish fashion.  As a result people are 
    overwhelmingly opposed to cloning at present.  
       
    President Clinton, never missing an opportunity to take a 
    non-controversial stand, issued an executive order banning all 
    cloning research in the U.S.  for three months so that 
    "bioethicists" can evaluate the implications.  
                                           
    But the announcement of Dolly's unique parentage doesn't actually 
    cover any new ground that hasn't already been well tilled by 
    ethicists.  The scientific accomplishment of Dolly's conception is 
    remarkable from a scientific view only.  
      
    First, we should note for the record that the term cloning has 
    been somewhat abused in the whole incident.  As is often the case, 
    the scientific usage of the word "cloning" doesn't quite match up 
    with the popular definition of cloning.  By "cloning." In 
    scientific terms, cloning simply means reproducing a plant or 
    animal from a single parent so that the conceived animal has the 
    same DNA as the parent animal.  This much was accomplished by 
    Dolly's producers.  However, Dolly was brought to term by a host 
    mother, much in the same way that other artificially conceived 
    animals, including humans are.  So despite the public's perception 
    that cloning means growing animals in a laboratory somewhere, like 
    something you'd see on The X-Files, the fact of the matter is that 
    cloning, in terms of what Dolly's producers have done, is nothing 
    more than another means of artificial conception.  Journalists 
    have done little or nothing to disabuse people of this 
    misconception.  
      
    Also, journalists are quick to instill an assumption among the 
    populace that Dolly's birth and growth into a mature sheep are 
    proof enough cloning can be accomplished and that there aren't any 
    physical side effects at stake.  Perhaps Dolly's producers are a 
    little bit guilty of creating this assumption, since they have 
    after all announced Dolly as a success.  However, one data point 
    does not establish a trend.  Until many sheep are cloned and 
    studied over long periods of time, we won't know for sure what, if 
    any, real problems might arise from artificial concetption by 
    cloning.  
      
    But assuming that artificial conception by cloning is inherently 
    no more risky than any other type of conception, artificial or 
    natural, what of it?  Should it be banned?  
      
    Society has had this debate already, not too long ago, when "test 
    tube babies" were being debated.  And even though there was an 
    initial negative reaction among the general population when the 
    news first became generally known, in a short period of time, 
    people began to realize that there really isn't an ethical problem 
    with the idea of test tube babies.  Likewise, there ought not to 
    be any ethical obstacles to artificial conception via cloning.  
    Perhaps there will be legal issues that arise.  Certainly, 
    artificial conception via cloning brings a whole new meaning to 
    the term, "single parent family." But legal rights and 
    responsibilities are easily sorted out once the ethical principles 
    are established.  
                                           
    The reason that artificial conception by cloning doesn't pose any 
    new ethical problems for society is because it follows in the same 
    foot steps as other artificial methods of conception.  And all 
    artificial conception methods fall under the same basic principle.  
    Fortunately, it's a principle with a long established track 
    record.  It's a principle that has virtually universal support 
    across all religions, all races, and all cultures.  
      
    The guiding principle behind all artificial conceptions is that a 
    person's worth and value is always judged by their character and 
    morals as demonstrated by the actions they take.  We never judge 
    the worth or value of a person based on genetic factors such as 
    the color of their skin, or the color of their eyes.  Nor do we 
    judge a person's worht by factors that might, even indirectly be 
    genetically based.  For example, even _if_ it had been proven that 
    IQ is somewhat genetically determined, we would not devalue those 
    who were genetically predisposed to having lower IQs.  
                                           
    Not only do find it unacceptale to judge an individual based on 
    their genetic similarity to others, i.e., the race to which they 
    belong.  Most cultures on the planet rightfully refuse to judge a 
    person's value or worthines based on the individual's parentage.  
    Regardless of whether your parent was Hitler or Einstein, society 
    accepts that you should be judged independently of your parents 
    fame or infamy.  
      
    By the same principle that causes us not to judge others because 
    of their inherent genetic differences, we should also not judge 
    others by the their inherent genetic sameness.  Even if we can 
    someday predict predispostions based on genetics, we should judge 
    people's value by what they do and what values they uphold, not by 
    their genetic predisposition.  
                                           
    And today we don't judge a child by the number of people raising 
    him or her.  While we may believe that a two parent household is 
    better than a single parent household, we don't devalue the child 
    because there is only one parent in the house.  Likewise, we ought 
    not to devalue a child just because he or she has only one 
    person's DNA, though we may disapprove of the "parent" for having 
    conceived in that fashion.  
                                           
    Whether we like it or not, the ability to artificially conceive a 
    child is not outside the realm of possibility in the near future.  
    It would be foolish to think that it will never be attempted.  For 
    better or worse, the idea of cloning is already with us to stay.  
    Fortunately, we humans are remarkably resilient to change and the 
    moral values we use to guide us are equally resilient.  And the 
    sweet irony of the whole situation is that the further science 
    advances our capabilities in the field of artificial reproduction, 
    the more we will come to realize that being human is not so much a 
    physical phenomena as it is a spiritual one.

                  About Stuck In Traffic 
        
    Stuck In Traffic is a monthly magazine dedicated to evaluating 
    current events, examining cultural phenomena, and sharing true 
    stories.  
      
    Why "Stuck In Traffic"?  
        
    Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you.  It's an 
    opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the 
    personal to the global.  As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the 
    Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, "Let's consider a reevaluation of 
    the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, 
    the zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible 
    situations, but the best possible situation you could be in.  
    After all, it's exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so 
    much trouble to induce...."
