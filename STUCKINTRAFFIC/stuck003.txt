    Stuck In Traffic #3

    Minneapolis Dress Code

    According to an AP wire story, a woman in Minneapolis was stopped
    by police because she looked "bizarre", arrested, and charge with
    "concealing one's identity in public" because she was dressed in a
    robe and a veil.  It turned out that the woman was a Muslim and
    required by her religion to dress that way.  The police spokesman
    said there was no exemption in the law for religious reasons.
                                                            
    The press seems to have covered the story from the freedom of
    religion angle., and that's fine by me.  Freedom of religion is
    important.  It's one of the defining charactersitics of the United
    States as far as I'm concerned.
                                                            
    But what troubles me even more is that there is a law in at least
    one city that prohibits you from concealing your identity in
    public.  And furthermore that police can stop and arrest you for
    no other reason than 'looking bizarre'.  What's next?  Dress
    codes?  Why doesn't the government just tattoo our social security
    number on our foreheads and be done with any pretense of
    sovereignty?  There used to be a time when you could go about your
    business as long as you weren't bothering anyone.  That day is
    long past.

    Where Were the Goblins?

    Kids just don't have a clue about how to do Halloween anymore.
    It's a shame really.  When I was a kid growing up in suburbia, we
    knew how Halloween was supposed to be done.  The object is to look
    SCARY.  And frighten people into giving you treats so that you
    don't throw eggs at their house or otherwise play tricks on them.
    It's blackmail and extortion kid-style.  It's one night during the
    year where you can be rude, crude and socially unacceptable.
                                                            
    But the kids coming to my door during Halloween this year stood
    there like their moms dressed them up for Sunday school in a
    bow-tie and waited for my handouts.  Almost all of them said
    "Thank-You".  Arrrgh!  Thank You on Halloween Eve?  What's the
    world coming to?

    On Haiti

    Just after the invasion, oops sorry, occupation, no that's not
    right either.  Well, just after we did whatever it is we did to
    Haiti, I was chatting in a local coffee house with a friend of
    mine about the Haiti affair.  I mentioned that I could not see any
    compelling interest that the United States had in Haiti.  And my
    friend, in an indignant outrage yelled, "My God, man!  It's the
    back door into the Dominican Republic!"

    On The Elections

    My main comment on the elections is that I expect the country to
    lurch in a different direction now, though not necessarily a
    better one.  That remains to be seen.  However, the Republicans'
    "Contract With America" has added an uncommon twist to the text
    two year's Washington watching.  In two years, it will be
    perfectly clear just how well the Republicans have, or haven't
    lived up to their campaign promises.
                                                            
    Of course there are many ways to go back on your promise without
    appearing to do so.  One common tactic is the multiple competing
    bills tactic.  Congress has been doing this for years on the
    balanced budget issues.  The idea is to make sure there are at
    least three or four competing bills for basically the same
    proposal.  Then the representatives all pick one and grandstand
    over it.  But no single bill ever quite picks up the majority of
    votes to get out of committee.  Then the Representatives can all
    go home and brag about how they supported the bill and it was
    really everyone else's fault that it didn't get passed.  I expect
    this tactic to get used on the term-limits issue.

    ===========
    Term Limits

    If it came up for a vote among the general populace, I'm sure
    term-limits would pass.  I might even vote for it myself.  But I
    seriously doubt that term limits will improve our government.

    I believe that term limits will just reinforce politicians'
    primary bad habit:  spending money before you have it in hand.  If
    you are an elected representative facing a single term tenure, you
    have an incentive to bring get as much as possible for your
    district in as quick a time as possible and you have an incentive
    to delay having to pay for it as long as possible.  In fact, the
    best possible scenario for a one-term elected official would be to
    buy on credit now, and have the bill come due after you are out of
    office.  That's not exactly a formula for reforming Congress.

    Most term-limits advocates believe that term limits would
    encourage 'citizen statesmen' to run for office and boot out the
    career politician.  Citizen statesmen, i.e.  men and women who
    have other, nonpolitical careers, is a great goal.  But in my
    opinion, term-limits do not encourage citizen statesmen from
    running for office because it costs so much money to run a
    political campaign.  Under a term-limits scenario, the people who
    run for office will be dependent on PACS and special interest
    groups to get them elected.

    So I believe the best strategy for encouraging citizen statesmen
    is to make it cheaper to run for office.  And the best way of
    doing that, without costing the tax payers a dime, is to
    drastically reduce the size of a representative's districts.
    Ideally, I'd like to see the size of a U.S.  House district be
    about the size of a typical state house district.  Since there
    would be so many fewer people in each district, the cost of
    running a campaign would be cut drastically.

    Running for office would still require a serious financial
    commitment, but someone with broad support in the community should
    be able to raise enough money from their constituents to run a
    campaign in a district that small.  That wouldn't make the PACs
    and special interests go away of course.  A candidate could still
    accept money from them.  But it would enable citizen statesmen
    candidates to at least compete with them.  And who would you be
    more likely to vote for, a candidate who raised enough money from
    individual contributions to fund their campaign or a candidate who
    is funded by PACs and special interest groups?
                                                            
    One way to keep the size of districts small is to return to the
    original Constitution.  Originally, the constitution called for
    districts of a fixed size.  As the population grew, so did the
    number of representatives.  It wasn't until later that a
    Constitutional amendment fixed the number of Representatives and
    increased the size of districts.

    Helms Steps In It!

    Being from North Carolina, and confessing to being something of an
    armchair political commentator, I suppose I am somewhat obligated
    to comment on Senator Jesse Helms' recent political gaffe in which
    he said something to the effect that President Clinton shouldn't
    visit any military base in North Carolina without a bodyguard.
    Well, it's an insult.  Pure and simple.  Jesse Helms insulted the
    President of the United States.  That just isn't done.  Even the
    bitterest political rivals in Washington maintain a semblance of
    decorum when addressing each other, calling each other 'Gentleman'
    or Gentlewoman' even when they'd rather call each other 'flaming
    liberal' or 'fascist pig'.  Helms stepped over the line.  The
    press went nuts over the issue and simply would not let the issue
    die for a long time.  At the time I'm writing this, the story has
    finally left the front pages and now is mostly covered in the
    editorial page.  But there are still lots of offhand remarks about
    the incident, especially when discussion of the Senate Foreign
    Relations Committee comes up.  

    I would not want to be misconstrued as defending Helms on the
    issue, but it does appear that the media is showing their bias in
    coverage of the incident.  In 1988 when Senator John Kerry, who is
    about as extremely Democratic as Helms is Republican, was asked by
    a reporter if Dan Quayle was qualified to be President.  Kerry
    replied, on the record, "Let me put it this way, if anything
    happens to President Bush, the Secret Service has orders to shoot
    Dan Quayle."  Funny thing that a big stink was not made about
    Kerry's remarks.  An equally insulting snide comment and yet it
    didn't get a tenth of the coverage that Helms' remark did.  To
    explain the discrepancy, you either have to claim either, a) the
    media is biased toward the Democrats and therefore covers them
    more favorably, or b) insulting the Vice-President is not nearly
    as bad manners as insulting the President.

    talent to the dark place where it leads."  --Erica Jong

    ==================
    Helms Steps In It?

    The press seems to believe that it is a forgone conclusion that
    the Helms 'bodyguard' comment was a mistake, a slip of the tongue
    from a borderline senile old man who doesn't have enough political
    savvy left to hold his seat in the Senate, much less chair the
    Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
                                                            
    But I believe it is equally plausible that the Helms remark was
    deliberate, finely timed, and well calculated.  If I remember
    correctly, the Helms 'bodyguard' quote was made to a reporter by
    the name of John Rosen at the Raleigh News and Observer.  The
    Raleigh News and Observer, (aka The Nuisance and Disturber) is
    well known for it's explicit Democratic Party leanings.  It makes
    no pretense of being objective when it comes to political
    commentary.  And John Rosen is not some fly-by-night reporter.  He
    is one of the N&O's key political reporters.  So when Helms was
    giving the interview to John Rosen in which he made his comments,
    he knew the biases of his interviewers.  It's not like this
    comment was made in a back room at a GOP strategy meeting.  He
    made it directly to a well-known reporter of a newspaper with well
    known biases.  So, it's difficult for me to believe that the
    comment was an accident.  I believe it was intentional.  In fact,
    I'll go out on a limb and claim that the Helms' 'bodyguard' quote
    was a de facto announcement that he is running for reelection
    (whenever that is).  My reasoning goes like this:

    First, Helms is getting on up there in years so running a
    fast-paced, whirlwind campaign is going to be difficult for him.
    Besides that, Helms is, to put it kindly, not the most telegenic
    politician that ever walked the face of the earth.  So traditional
    campaigning is not a very good option for him.
                                                            
    Second, whether it's true or not, Helms perceives that the media
    is biased against him simply because he is a conservative
    Republican.  Certainly that is my perception also.  But even if
    it's not true, that's Helm's _perception_.  So he can't count on
    the press glorifying his image to get him reelected.
                                                            
    Third, like any politician, he has to get a rapport going with his
    constituents.  He has to get people talking about him.  His name
    has to be on the tip of everyone's tongue.  So he absolutely has
    to get press coverage.

    So Helms does something that is guaranteed to inflame the
    (presumably) biased media yet develop a rapport with his
    constituents, or at least to get his name firmly ingrained in
    their brain.  The bodyguard quote was, in my opinion, an attempt
    at doing this.

    Now, believe it or not, most North Carolinians are not backwater
    rednecks.  Even folks from the most rural counties are decent,
    civilized folks.  (The redneck is a dying breed deserving federal
    endangered species protection.)  So almost everyone in North
    Carolina will, publicly, speak unfavorably of Helm's remark.  But,
    North Carolina _is_ an extremely conservative state and President
    Clinton, if the recent elections are to be believed, is very
    unpopular in this state.  (If memory serves, North Carolina is one
    of the few states that went to Bush in the '92 elections.)  So
    even if most folks will speak publicly against the propriety of
    Helms' remark, I believe Helms has earned himself a favorable
    place in the hearts and minds of many, many North Carolinians as
    'the man who told off President Clinton.'  Thanks of course to the
    national coverage his remarks have gotten.  Helms is playing the
    press like a musical instrument and making beautiful music to the
    ears of lots of people.

    All this is conjecture of course.  But Helms has done this sort of
    thing before.  Remember Helms campaign against Mapplethorpe and
    the NEA?  Here again was an issue that was guaranteed to inflame
    the media and generate endless coverage of Helms and yet it was
    also an issue that was certain to be well received by his
    conservative constituents.  The national and local media coverage
    was something like, "How in the world could Helms advocate
    abolishing the NEA?  How dare Helms suggest we impose moral
    standards on art?"  And it was endless.  Helms was in the news for
    months.  But the message received by his constituents was the
    Helms was the man who wants to put an end to blasphemous, immoral
    art funded with the tax dollars of good, honest, hard working
    people.
                                                            
    Love him or hate him, I don't believe you can write Helms off as a
    senile old man.  I believe he is a shrewd politician that knows
    exactly what he is doing.

    SEVEN SOFTWARE COMPANIES ADDED TO "WATCH LIST"
                                                                 
    The following story has been circulating around the internet
                                                                 
    New York, NJ, Sept.  24 -- People for the Ethical Treatment of
    Software (PETS) announced today that seven more software companies
    have been added to the group's "watch list" of companies that
    regularly practice software testing.

    "There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so
    that companies like these can market new products," said Ken
    Granola, spokesperson for PETS.  "Alternative methods of testing
    these products is available."

    According to PETS, these companies force software to undergo
    lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest for hours or days at
    a time.  Employees are assigned to "break" the software by any
    means necessary, and inside sources report that they often joke
    about "torturing" the software.

    "It's no joke," said Granola.  "Innocent programs, from the day
    they are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and 'crashed' for
    hours on end.  They spend their whole lives on dirty,
    ill-maintained computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when
    they're not needed anymore."

    Granola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is
    infested with bugs.  "We know alternatives to this horror exist,"
    he said, citing industry giant Microsoft Corp.  as a company that
    has become extremely successful without resorting to software
    testing.

    Where Are Your Papers?

    Over the past year the state of North Carolina has been promoting
    a high profile campaign called "Click It or Ticket".  The police
    set up roadblocks and stop all cars passing the checkpoint.  You
    have to produce identification, prove that your car is insured and
    you have to answer the police officer's questions about where
    you've been, what you were doing, and where you are going.  And
    oh, by the way, if you aren't wearing your seatbelt, you
    immediately are ticketed for a $25 fine.
                                                            
    I know because I have been stopped twice at these checkpoints.
                                                            
    Now the state is starting up a follow on program called "Booze It
    and Lose It" which is basically the same thing.  Random
    checkpoints where you have to produce identification, prove that
    your car is insured, and answer the officers' questions about
    where you've been and where you are going.  And, by the way, if
    you show any signs of having been drinking, they grill you further
    and possibly charge you with DWI.

    There are two interesting things about these programs.  First, the
    police have apprehended literally thousands of people wanted for
    various reasons.  It's unclear to me just how they do this and the
    press has not given any details.  But it appears to me that when
    they stop you, they check their computer systems to see if there
    are any outstanding warrants for you.  The two times I was
    stopped, I didn't actually see this happening.  But this past week
    I received the license plate renewal form for my car.  In the
    envelope was a notice that the NC Division of Motor Vehicles
    requires people to supply their driver's license number when they
    register their car, if they don't have it already.  And sure
    enough, there on my renewal form was my driver's license number.
    I strongly suspect that while I was being interviewed by the
    trooper, someone was looking up my license plate number, getting
    my driver's license number and looking up my records in their
    computers to see if there were any warrants for my arrest.
                                                            
    Regardless of how they do it, there are weekly press reports about
    how many tens of thousands of people the police have caught, from
    deadbeat dads who owe child support to people who have had their
    license revoked, to wanted criminals.
                                                            
    The second interesting thing about these programs is how amazingly
    popular they are.  The press have been reporting these programs as
    runaway successes.  Everyone they interview on TV, from the
    Governor down to the average Joe on the street says how great they
    think these programs are.  I have yet to see a single newspaper
    story or TV news story that questioned the authority of the police
    much less the propriety of these programs.  And this is just the
    sort of thing we need to be on the defense against.  As James
    Madison put it in 1788:  "I believe there are more instances of
    the abridgement of thefreedom of the people by gradual and silent
    encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden
    usurpations."

    I'm all for getting drunk drivers off the street.  But it seems to
    me that a program could be designed to crack down on drunk driving
    without turning North Carolina into a police state.

    History Is Up For Grabs
                                         
    In terms of their ability to do harm, I used to think that
    politician ranked at the top of the "most dangerous professions"
    list.  But I now think that historians, if they don't top the
    list, rank a very close second.  I came to this conclusion after
    reading Pat Hartman's excellent 'zine, Salon.  Issue number 22,
    almost all 148 pages of it, is dedicated to exploring the topic of
    Holocaust Revisionism.
                                                            
    Just mention the words "Holocaust Revisionist" and you will
    immediately find out exactly who does and does not support the
    First Amendment.  I personally know someone who was banned from
    participating in a "read in" during banned book week because he
    insisted on reading a revisionist book about the Holocaust.  It
    was fine if he wanted to read a "safe" book that people had tried
    to ban, like Huckleberry Finn or Tropic of Cancer.  But when it
    came to really subversive literature, they didn't want any part of
    it.  As Pat Hartman puts it in the opening paragraph of Salon:  "A
    characteristic of primitive societies is the existence of
    extensive taboos:  things which are never voiced, or which are
    articulated only in very special circumstances of revelation,
    initiation, and so on.  After some years of refreshing candor, the
    present-day world has gone retro, and humankind has managed to
    create a whole new realm of Things Which Must Not Be Spoken Of."

    It's obvious that Pat has done a large amount of secondary
    research on this issue and she does an admirable job of covering
    the breadth of the whole debate.  Pat covers both sides of the
    debate and gives you the gist of who all the key players are and
    their backgrounds.  Pat summarizes the points and counterpoints
    each side makes and points you to further reading on most topics.
    It won't make you an expert on Holocaust Revisionism, but it's a
    great place to start.  You will be able to hold up your end of a
    conversation when confronted by a Holocaust Revisionist.

    So are the Holocaust Revisionists' arguments convincing?  Did Pat
    come away from her research/oddesy with a different view than when
    she started.  Not really.  On the whole, Pat finds the
    Revisionists' arguments to be "pretty thin".
                                                            
    But not entirely transparent either.  Some of the assertions made
    by the revisionists have come to be accepted over time and the
    official keepers of the Holocaust history have even updated their
    official estimates of the numbers of people killed during the
    Holocaust.  And the Holocaust history keepers aren't entirely
    without fault either.  Pat Hartman does a credible job of showing
    how Holocaust historians have tried to thwart investigation and
    criticism of the official party line.  Having a reference work
    that pretty much covers the entire scope of the Holocaust Revision
    debate is well worth the $5.00 price on that issue of Salon.  But
    the true value of Pat Hartman's investigation into Holocaust
    Revisionism doesn't lie in the completeness of her survey.  It's a
    stunning demonstration of just how much our view of history
    depends on the historians writing it.  And that's why historians
    are so dangerous.  If you are interested in getting Salon, the
    price is $5.00 and Salon's address is 305 W. Magnolia - Ste 386,
    Fort Collins Colorado, 80521.  The Holocaust Revision issue is
    Number 22.
