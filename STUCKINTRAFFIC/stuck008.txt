    Stuck In Traffic #7

    =========== 
    The Verdict
          
    I have to admit being more than a little cranky on the day that
    The Verdict was delivered by the jury.  And while I'm still
    disturbed about the whole Simpson case, I've come to accept the
    jury's verdict.

    I haven't followed all the post Verdict interviews, but it seems
    that the jury believed that the bloody glove found behind
    Simpson's house was planted, primarily because it wasn't found
    until a couple of days after the initial crime scene
    investigation.  And frankly it does sound a little suspicious.
    Furthermore, the jury apparently did not trust the blood evidence
    on the grounds that the "chain of custody" of the blood was
    questionable and that some of the blood was unaccounted for.  And
    on top of it all, there's the indications of racism at work
    considering the past history of one of the key investigators.  So
    I can see how the jury would conclude that there was enough of a
    possibility that the evidence had been planted to cast the
    "reasonable doubt."
                                           
    It appeared to me from the beginning that the whole case hinged on
    the blood evidence.  My reasoning was that the blood absolutely
    identified O.J.  Simpson.  If O.J.'s blood was at the scene of the
    crime, mixed with the victims' blood, then one can reasonably
    conclude that O.J.  was present at the scene of the crime when the
    murder happened.  And if the police investigators do a
    sufficiently rigorous investigation of the crime scene and find no
    evidence of anyone else being present, then you can reasonably
    conclude that O.J.  was the only other person besides the victims
    at the crime scene.  Now, lack of evidence never proves a point.
    So the fact that no indications of other people were found does
    not absolutely prove that no one else was at the crime, so you
    have to pass judgement on how rigorous the investigation was and
    how trustworthy the investigators are.  But assume that the
    investigation does pass muster, you have proof that O.J.  was at
    the crime scene at the time of the murder and can reasonably infer
    that he was the only person at the scene, I think a jury would
    find him guilty in that case.

    But they didn't.  And as much as I hate the thought of justice not
    being served and letting a double murder go unsolved, I've come to
    accept that the jury probably did the right thing.  It seems to me
    that there was just to much doubt cast on the handling of the
    blood evidence.  And if the jury had found O.J.  guilty, it could
    serve as a dangerous precedent with regard to the admissibility of
    blood evidence in future cases.  The thing we have to keep in mind
    is that we have just as much an interest in preventing innocent
    people from being framed for murder as we have in punishing the
    real murderer.  If the police are going to take blood samples for
    the purpose of typing the defendants blood in the investigation,
    we want to make sure every single drop, every single molecule of
    the defendants blood to be accounted for, in order for there to be
    no question whatsoever of their being any planting of evidence.
    In fact, I would go as far as to say that the police, the people
    trying to prosecute the case, should not be the ones responsible
    for collecting the blood and keeping it.  Such duties should be
    carried out by a third party who is neutral.  And if blood
    evidence is to have any value whatsoever, it seems to me that it
    must be collected immediately, during the initial crime scene
    investigation.  This business of finding blood evidence several
    days after the initial crime scene investigation again raises the
    possibility of evidence planting.

    But was the jury predisposed to finding O.J.  Innocent?  Was the
    jury looking for any excuse, no matter how tenuous, to justify
    letting O.J.  off the hook?  Many have made that claim.  But I
    personally don't see any evidence of that being the case.  If such
    factors were at work in this case, I find it difficult to believe
    that all 12 jurors would be affected and it would have taken only
    one person to hang the jury.
                                           
    ==========
    The Murder
                          
    Accepting the fact that the handling of the case by the police was
    subpar to the point of casting reasonable doubt on the
    prosecution's case, who killed Nicole Brown-Simpson and Ronald
    Goldman?  One would think that there are at least a few of the
    reporters camped out at "O.J."  city with an iota of initiative
    that would engage in some investigation of the facts of the case
    instead of participating in media slumming at the court house.

    Can anyone doubt that O.J.  Simpson is still the most likely
    suspect?  While I accept the fact that O.J.  Simpson has been
    found "Not Guilty," it is also true that he has not been found
    "innocent".

    =========
    The Media
                           
    I find the media coverage of the O.J.  Simpson trial to be
    absolutely unforgiveable.  I can't think of a single good thing to
    say about the media coverage of the O.J.  Simpson trial.  First of
    all they devoted way too much time/print space on the coverage.
    By about a factor of 100 in my opinion.  There simply was not
    enough "news" in the trial to justify it.  When I think of all
    that effort that could have been spent on covering real news
    stories, it just sickens me.  I keep thinking, "What have we
    missed this year that we should have heard about?"

    And given the fact that the press did cover the O.J.  Trial as
    heavily as it did, I'm appalled at the shallowness of the
    coverage.  The plain fact of the matter is that it was covered
    like a soap opera.  It was sugarcoated entertainment disguised as
    news.  Instead of investigative stories about what it takes to
    convict someone of a murder in California, we got stories on the
    prosecutor's hair styles.  It appears that the press corps just
    sat around the courthouse waiting to get the latest sound bites
    from the lawyers and amused themselves the rest of the time by
    talking about how many press people were there.

    ====================
    Mini-Drama at U.P.S.
                
    Life is full of mini-dramas, even during the most boring mundane
    parts.
                                           
    Last week I went to UPS to mail a package late in the afternoon.
    It was right about the time everyone was getting off work and the
    traffic was bad.  Everyone was tired.  It was Friday afternoon so
    everyone was in a hurry to get the weekend started.  Tempers were
    short.

    At the UPS mailing center there was a long line of people waiting
    and only two ladies working behind the counter.  One was a tall
    black woman, probably in her mid thirties and the other was an
    older white woman who looked awfully close to retirement age.
    They both looked tired.  They both looked like they had been
    hauling boxes around all day, which I expect they had.

    Everyone in line looked tired, disheveled, and sullen.  I hadn't
    been paying much attention to what was going on.  I was more or
    less lost in my thoughts when all of a sudden this woman started
    yelling at the top of her lungs at the black lady behind the
    counter.  "You're not helping me!"  she screamed, "I've been
    waiting in this line for thirty minutes and now you're not helping
    me."  Off she went on a tirade about how she had called the UPS
    800 number and they had told her that the service center would
    help her fill out the right forms and son on and so forth and now
    the lady behind the counter refused to help her, etc.  etc etc.
    It was really loud.

    I didn't see the events preceding this tirade, but the woman
    behind me in line told me later what had happened.  The customer
    who had gotten upset had not filled out a shipping bill while in
    line.  There are signs all over the place in there indicating that
    you have to fill out a shipping bill for every package you mail
    with UPS.  But apparently the customer had some questions about
    the form and so had not filled it out.  So when the customer got
    up to the employee had given her a shipping bill to fill out and
    told her to step aside and fill out the form while she helped the
    next person in line.

    Now, I've seen this happen all over the place, at the post office,
    at other stores.  Most customers are willing to do this to help
    the employees service everyone a little faster.  But apparently
    the woman working at the counter did not realize that the customer
    had not filled out the form because she didn't know how.  The lady
    behind me in line told me that it appeared to her that the angry
    customer was trying to ship an international package.  But
    international packages use a different shipping bill from domestic
    packages and the customer had apparently been given a domestic
    form, which did not have room for all the information needed to
    ship an international package.

    By the way, the lady behind me impressed me with the authority
    with which she spoke about UPS shipping bills.  Her outward
    appearance belied her attitude.  She looked like someone who
    didn't care about anything other than which Country-Western bar
    had the 25 cent beer on draft.  But I was totally wrong about her.
    Serves me right for judging by appearances.  She was quick to
    point out to me that she had been a secretary for 10 years and
    knew how to ship just about anything anywhere using any company
    you could name.  After this minidrama was over, she proceeded to
    tell me about the trial and tribulations of working as a
    secretary.  One thing was clear, this was a woman who took her job
    very seriously.  And I thought to myself, "I'd hire this woman!
    She knows what she's talking about!"

    After the angry woman had yelled and screamed and otherwise
    carried on for about 5 minutes she finally stormed out of the
    place.  I kept waiting for large, brusque, black woman behind the
    counter to lose her cool.  But she didn't.  She managed to raise
    her voice very loudly without sounding angry.  She tried to find
    out what the angry lady's problems with the forms were but it was
    too late for that.  By this time the angry lady was fixated on the
    fact that she had been set aside and "not helped."

    After the angry lady had left, the whole place was filled with an
    uncomfortable silence.  And this is where it gets interesting.  In
    that awkward pause after events like this, all the bystanders sit
    there and run the incident through their mind and pass judgement
    on what they just saw.  I admit I was doing the same.

    The only fault I could find with the lady behind the counter was
    that she had failed to realize that the reason the angry woman had
    not filled out her shipping bill ahead of time was because she
    didn't know how to do so.  But the lady behind the counter was
    just trying to be as efficient as possible.  If she had just stood
    there idly while the angry woman had filled out her forms,
    everyone else in line would have had to wait that much longer.

    And the sentiments of the bystanders', mine included, were
    overwhelmingly in favor of the woman working the counter and
    against the angry woman.  And this is where I learned a lesson
    worth remembering.  Judging from the comments I heard other people
    in line make, they favored the woman behind the counter because
    she kept control and did not lose here cool.  Everyone was turned
    off by the angry woman's tirade.  And even though she may have
    started out with a legitimate complaint about not being helped, no
    one had any sympathy for her because she had pitched a tantrum
    about it.

    No matter what the injustice is, no matter how small or large, you
    aren't going to get it corrected unless you have the public's
    sentiment; and making a nuisance of yourself is sure fire way to
    lose favor with the public.  Appearances are important.

    =============================
    Get Ready For The Politicians
       
    Election season is just around the corner.  There will be hundreds
    of candidates making stump speeches, kissing babies, doling out
    sound-bites.  The press has long ago given up trying to dig
    beneath the surface of the candidate's made-for-TV persona.  So
    it's up to us to keep the politicians on their toes.

    If you go to any candidate debates, or if you have a chance to ask
    a politician on a radio talk show, here's a great question to ask.
    I got it from the TV show Northern Exposure and I think it forces
    a candidate to real show his/her true colors:

    Do you see the stop sign as a Jeffersonian or Hamiltonian
    expression of democracy in action?
                                             
                                             
    ===============================

    The only hope in a world where there are men who will kill for a
    pack of cigarettes is for there to be men willing to die defending
    a pack of cigarettes.
                                             
    ================
    Help For Smokers
                    
    Reason magazine reports in its latest issue that the FDA now
    regulates cigarettes as a "drug delivery device," which means
    smokers are now officially classified as addicts who are therefore
    protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act.  Go figure.

    ==============
    The State Fair
                      
    The North Carolina State Fair opens this week, officially kicking
    of Fall.  Normally I'm not one who's into crowds and noise, but I
    love going to the State Fair.  There are just too many bizarre
    sights and sounds to pass up.

    One company that shows up every year sells Aloe based lipstick to
    ladies under the premise that it lasts all day without coming off.
    I always have this picture in my mind of little old ladies
    painting their lips a deep red with this stuff and then never
    being able to get it off again.

    There is also a man that shows up every year selling various
    unusual organic things.  He has hundreds of little bottles of
    herbs and spices and other kinds of plants and he can tell you
    what each one is good for.  He can tell you about various
    medicines you can concoct with them (Don't tell the FDA) and he
    can tell you how to use them in recipes.

    The NC State University Drama department and the NC Department of
    Agriculture team up each year to put on a show for little kids
    extolling the virtues of eating a balanced meal.  The stage show
    is filled with normally serious drama students dressed up has
    carrots, tomatoes, grapes, bananas, sweet potatoes, and slices of
    bread (whole grain of course, not white) dancing and singing
    across a makeshift stage.

    Every radio station and TV station in town broadcasts live from
    the Fair during the week.  And the various radio and TV
    personalities have to work really hard to appear excited to be
    there.  I don't know why they have a hard time appearing sincere,
    but they do.  Especially in person.  If you walk up to them on
    person at the fair, you still get this feeling of separation, like
    they are still on TV or something.  And inevitably, the TV/radio
    personality has to find some 8 year old kid, stick a microphone in
    his face and ask the kid what his name is.  The kid _always_ takes
    a long few seconds to manage a reply, like he or she has had to
    think about the answer and then the TV/radio personality has to
    act like it's so amazing to be talking to a little kid.

    The State Fair is also a good place to go shopping for any Farm
    implements you might need.  I always enjoy the John Deere exhibit.
    They line up the latest tractor models just like you would see
    cars on a show room floor, as if they were sleek sports cars or
    something.  It's really bizarre, almost Kafka-esque.

    And I confess to still enjoying the petting zoo.  Let's face it,
    there aren't too many opportunities to pet a goat during the year.
    So you might as well take advantage of it.  I can take or leave
    the bunny rabbits and the pigs.  But goats are cool.  They have an
    attitude problem which I can respect.

    The horses are great too.  There are usually several horse shows
    during the week and I try to make at least one of them.  My
    favorite of the horse shows are the jumping competitions.  It
    seems to me amazing that a horse can jump at all.  Just looking at
    a horse, it's hard to imagine that they can actually jump.  So
    every jump they make is a minidrama.  And it's even harder for me
    to grasp the fact that they can land their entire weight on those
    spindly legs.

    I'm not into the rides at the State Fair as much as I used to be.
    Not because I'm worried that they are "unsafe" or anything like
    that.  The whole point of carnival rides is to give you a feeling
    of "unsafe," so the unbiquitous rumors of this or that carnival
    ride breaking down at critical times just adds to the excitement.
    But the rides at the State Fair have just gotten to darn expensive
    for a tightwad like me.  One of my favorite rides looks like the
    deck of a pirate's ship.  You get into it and strap yourself down
    and it simply swings back and forth in this huge sweeping arc.  It
    doesn't even go all the way around in a loop.  It just goes back
    and forth.  But the ride is very open.  It doesn't have a lot of
    support machinery around you.  So you get this feeling terrific
    feeling of air moving around you and the scenery swinging by.

    If you have an opportunity to attend a State Fair, go.  It's worth
    the effort if you keep your eyes open.
