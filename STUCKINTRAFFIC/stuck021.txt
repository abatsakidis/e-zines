    Trading For China's Human Rights
    The 2 billion person Chinese market is an attractive, lucrative 
    market for U.S. businesses. But can we trade with a country that 
    oppresses its citizens so badly? Yes, we can. And we must. 
    Here's how to do it without compromising our principles.

                          Current Events
    Trading For China's Human Rights

    With the reelection of President Clinton, the United States is now 
    rushing to open up trade relations with The People's Republic of China 
    as much as possible. China and the Pacific Rim countries represent a 
    booming region of the world, home to over 2 billion people, and, by 
    some estimates, account for more than 40% of all global trade. If 
    nothing else, China represents, a huge untapped market for American 
    trade. Therefore there is tremendous pressure on President Clinton to 
    open up trade relations with China. And the Clinton administration has 
    succumbed to that pressure, despite advocating exactly the opposite 
    position in his 1992 Presidential campaign against George Bush. 

    But What About Human Rights?  

    But Americans are as sensitive to human rights issues as they are 
    sensitive to opportunities to make a buck. The United States was born 
    from the notion that "all men are created equal" and this notion has 
    defined the character of the United States more than any other. 
    Equality under the eyes of the law, the absences of class 
    stratification, the sovereignty of the individual have been the key 
    driving forces of both our national character and our economic 
    strength. The United States has a less than perfect record with these 
    principles. Starting with the "3/5's Compromise" in the Constitution 
    that counted slaves as only 3/5 of a person with regard to representation 
    in government, continuing on through the United States Civil War in the 
    1860's and continuing through the United States Civil Rights movement 
    today, the United States has constantly had to struggle with resolving 
    the difference between it's pro-individualist ideals and it's less than 
    perfect implementation of those ideals. But looking back over the past 
    200 years, the progress is obvious and this struggle toward our ideals 
    has made United States citizens among the strongest opponents of 
    government oppression in the world. 

    The People's Republic of China, on the other hand, has one of the 
    worst human rights records in the world. Even as high ranking U.S. 
    officials were traveling to Asia and meeting with Chinese officials in 
    November to start a new era in Sino-American relations, the Chinese 
    government was continuing the oppression of its citizens. 

    On November 11th, UPI reported on a Chinese government crackdown on 
    activists at college campuses: 

      "[Bejing police] also uncovered 72 crime hotspots on campus and 
    conducted surveillance on 214 nearby sales stalls, 136 businesses, 
    37 food vendors and eight dance and entertainment parlors. 
      Guangdong police conducted 85 anticrime sweeps during the period,  
    discovering illegal migrants living in 162 rooms, dismantling 767 
    makeshift dwellings and demolishing 290 unlicensed commercial stalls 
    and 10 dance halls. 
      In Nanning, the capital of southwest Guangxi province, police shut  
    down 102 illegal cultural and recreational facilities and seized 
    4,000 books and magazines." 

    The People's Republic of China is still a country where the government 
    can conduct secret surveillance on its citizens at will, remove 
    people from where they live, destroy their homes, and businesses, and 
    confiscate their books.  

    In Hong Kong, the Chinese government has disbanded the democratically 
    elected legislature and is in the process of replacing it with a 
    government appointed by the Chinese government. The Chinese appointed a 
    "Select Committee" of hand picked, pro-China members who, unsurprisingly 
    appointed a pro-China Chief Executive and are in the process of forming 
    a legislative body of which over half will be composed of 
    "representatives" appointed by the Select Committee. Furthermore, the 
    New York Times reports that "Chinese officials have warned that they 
    will not allow "rumors or lies" in the press about China, suggesting 
    that Bejing will have little tolerance for the press freedoms Hong Kong 
    has enjoyed. For all intents and purposes, China is killing 
    representative democracy in Hong Kong. 

    The President's Advisory Committee on Religious Freedoms Abroad cited 
    Chinese oppression of Tibetan culture and religious practices as a 
    key example of religious persecution abroad. Assistant Secretary of 
    State John Shattuck, head of committee, said in a recent trip to Asia:
    "One of the great focus points of our human rights concerns in China 
    and Tibet has been problems of religious freedom and discrimination 
    against those who are engaged in trying to exercise religious freedom,'' 

    Just one day after President Clinton announced the United States' 
    change in policy with regard to China, the Chinese government announced 
    that it would try three people in the Anhui province on charges of 
    "counterrevolution and conspiracy" for a series of articles they wrote 
    in and published in 1991. China is still a country where you can be 
    arrested and put in jail for speaking your mind in public. 

    And all this is just from November. One month of one year. 

    And we in the United States have been unable to forget the 1989 
    Tianemen Square Massacre. We're haunted by it.  Thousands of students 
    and activists held pro-democracy demonstrations, calling for reforms 
    in the Chinese government with the same spirit and dedication that 
    would make even the most strident American activist proud.  These 
    demonstrators looked to the United States for inspiration. The held 
    up banners written in English so that we could hear their message, so 
    that we could hear their appeals for help. The constructed their own 
    Statue of Liberty in Tianemen Square. The Chinese government killed them 
    by the thousands. Many were literally run over with tanks. 

    So it is difficult for us in the United States to accept the idea of 
    "opening up trade with China." Would conducting business in China lend 
    legitimacy to a government that is diametrically opposed to our most 
    cherished and fundamental ideals? This is the dilemma of Sino-American 
    relations as many see it. 

    Fixing the Dilemma

    But it's a false dilemma. We in the United States can, and must, trade 
    with the Chinese if we ever hope to reform the Chinese government. 

    If there's one lesson that people in the United States have never 
    quite learned from their short history, it's that economic freedom and 
    personal freedom are inextricably intertwined. It's no mistake that the 
    United States has both the strongest economy and the freest people. When 
    people are allowed to conduct their own business, when people respect 
    each other's right to property, when they have a civilized and consistent 
    means of resolving disputes between themselves, when they have the 
    freedom to trade and conduct business with whomever they choose, they 
    develop a sense of self-sufficiency, independence, and freedom. Freedom 
    is nothing if not the ability to support yourself as you see fit. Free 
    trade, along with freedom of the press, and freedom of religion, is one of 
    the fundamental necessities for ensuring basic human rights. 

    Unfortunately, much of the United States' foreign policy has ignored 
    this basic tenet and often our foreign policy has been based on exactly 
    the opposite assumption, that human rights efforts in a country can be 
    served by denying free and open trade to that country. 

    Somehow, as the conventional wisdom goes, if we economically isolate 
    a country by prohibiting U.S. based businesses from trading with it, 
    the country will become so starved for our goods and services that it 
    will reform its ways in order to gain favor with us. Somehow, the poor 
    economic conditions are supposed to create a groundswell of grassroots 
    support to reform the abusive government. This approach to human rights 
    policy has not succeeded even once. It has been put into practice to 
    its fullest extent in Cuba. The United States, thanks to it's 
    geographical closeness to Cuba, has been able to enforce near total 
    economic isolation of Cuba for nearly 30 years. It only survived so 
    long due to the heavy support from the Soviet Union. But as soon as the 
    Soviet Union withered away, Cuba's economy crumbled and it has become 
    among the poorest nations in this hemisphere. We routinely hear horror 
    stories about how desperately poor people are in Cuba and how they have 
    to struggle just to feed themselves. But 30 years of economic isolation 
    has not generated any grassroots revolution for change in Cuba. 30 
    years of economic isolation has not improved the human rights situation 
    in Cuba. 

    Iraq is the other country that's currently the target of economic 
    isolation policies from the United States and the rest of the world. 
    And while the Iraqi economy is in shambles, the Iraqi government shows 
    no signs of reforming itself or it's human rights practices.  

    Damaging a country economically rarely, if ever, translates into 
    political reform. Starving citizens make poor revolutionaries. 
    In fact it actually helps the abusive government control its people. 
    So instead of trying to improve human rights policies of other 
    governments by denying trade with them, we need to find ways to use 
    economic relationships to improve the human rights situations in these 
    countries and leverage those economic relationships to the maximum extent 
    possible. 

    How We Can Help The Chinese

    The first step in properly conducting relations with China is stop 
    trying to downplay China's dismal human rights record. This is where 
    much of the United States' past China policy has gone horribly wrong, 
    and where the Clinton Administration in particular has erred the most. 

    After meeting with Chinese officials on November 18th, Treasury 
    Secretary Robert Rubin said, "We are fundamentally different in many 
    respects, with different approaches to economic development, macroeconomic 
    management and business regulation ... The key is not to let individual 
    disagreements affect the overall relationship, and to work constructively 
    to resolve disagreements whenever possible." By portraying the Chinese 
    government as simply taking a "different approach" to the economy, Rubin 
    legitimizes the Chinese government's strangle hold on the Chinese economy 
    and legitimizes China's human rights abuses. We believe in freedom and 
    human rights. China doesn't. That's far more than a "different approach" 
    to governing. 

    Rubin could have served the cause of human rights in a much more 
    fundamental way. After the meeting between him and his Chinese 
    counterparts, he should have made statements along the lines of, "The 
    United States is attempting to open up trade relations with the Chinese 
    people so that we can help them rebuild their faltering economy and ensure 
    the human rights of every Chinese citizen. We recognize that building a 
    thriving economy and a healthy middle class is the first step to securing 
    the basic human rights of every citizen." This would have caused an 
    international scandal, but it would put the Chinese government in a 
    difficult position. Remember, "trade," whether on a large or small scale, 
    is by definition a win-win situation. "Trade" happens when both parties 
    in the transaction perceive a benefit. The Chinese are not doing us any 
    favors by opening up their markets to foreign countries. They benefit from 
    the relationship as well. But continuing to open up their markets after a 
    statement like that would be a tacit acknowledgement that the People's 
    Republic of China has not served its citizens interests. 

    The second step that The United States could take in order to 
    demonstrate a commitment to the cause of human rights and to 
    demonstrate the interconnection between economic freedom and personal 
    freedom is to explicitly and decidedly support those countries in the 
    area that have freer political systems. At a minimum, we need to bear 
    witness to the China's destruction of democracy in Hong Kong. And more 
    importantly, the United States needs to formally recognize the government 
    in Taiwan and the United States needs to clearly indicate that the reason 
    we are recognizing Taiwan is because it has better served its people, 
    both in terms of human rights and economic freedom, far better than 
    China has with its own people. 

    The likely result of these actions is that China would cut off official 
    efforts to improve trade relations with the United States. They would 
    have to do that to save face if for no other reason. But by doing so, 
    the Chinese government also take on the responsibility of trying to 
    economically isolate themselves from the rest of the world. The third 
    and final step in an appropriate strategy for improving human rights in 
    China is to bypass the Chinese government as much as possible and 
    appeal directly to the Chinese people. The United States' trade policy 
    should be the U.S. companies are welcome, and encouraged to trade 
    with anyone in China they want, without fear of reprisals from the 
    United States government. It is then the Chinese government's job to 
    try to prevent it, if they can. And the Chinese government would 
    certainly try, and probably succeed to a large extent at first. 

    But at least the United States would be practicing what it preaches. 
    And the Chinese government would be forced to practice what it preaches. 
    And when choices are clear, between authoritarian rule and freedom, people 
    invariably choose freedom. They may not start a revolution to reform 
    the Chinese government, but they will find a way to do business with 
    the rest of the free world. They will either develop a black market 
    economy or the authoritarian restrictions will be eroded away little by 
    little as a matter of "practicality." Either way, the Chinese will 
    discover, just as the we did 200 years ago, that building an economy 
    based on free trade is the first step to freedom from authoritarian rule.

                      Cultural Phenomena
    Blasphemous Christmas Cards

    Dan Quayle sent me a Christmas card. No, really. I'm not making this up. 
    _The_ Dan Quayle sent me a Christmas card. All the way from Carmel, 
    Indiana. 

    It's a really nice card. On the front there's a summertime picture of 
    the whole Quayle family, Dan, Marilyn, Tucker, Ben, and Corinne, plus 
    two dogs, sitting together on the family trampoline in the middle of a 
    gorgeously green back yard. Everyone looks relaxed and comfortable. Even 
    Marilyn looks unusually relaxed considering her normal demeanor and the 
    fact that she's sitting in the middle of a way, way overloaded trampoline. 

    On the inside it has what looks like a handwritten message, in friendly 
    green ink, that says, "May the Lord bless this nation and cause His grace 
    to fill each of our hearts. May His wisdom be manifest in the decisions 
    of our nation's leaders. In this season of joy, all of the Quayle's pray 
    for your contentment." 

    How nice. I looked back into the envelope that the card came in. I felt 
    certain that there _had_ to be a fund raising letter in there somewhere. 
    But there wasn't. Just the Christmas card. Just Dan, Marilyn, and the 
    Kids sending me their Holiday wishes. I mulled over this Christmas card 
    for a couple of hours. Well, actually there were no references to 
    Christmas. But you could tell that's what it was supposed to be. 

    Perfectly nice. How kind. And yet, well, something about this card began 
    to bother me. I couldn't quite put my finger on it for the longest time. 
    After all, there wasn't anything the least bit objectionable about 
    the card. How can anyone get upset about receiving a simple Chirstmas card? 

    For a while I thought maybe it was because I didn't like the Quayles. 
    But no, that wasn't it. While I'm not particularly fond of Dan Quayle's 
    brand of conservatism, I don't have any bone to pick with him personally. 
    Indeed, among conservative Republicans, he's probably one of the more 
    tolerable ones. No, I wasn't bothered by this card because of anything 
    in particular about Dan Quayle. How could I? I never met the man. 

    Bingo. I never met him. That's why I was bothered by this card. Why in 
    the world was this guy sending me a Chirstmas card when I never met 
    him before? It was totally inappropriate. Chirstmas cards are something 
    that close friends and family send to each other during the Chirstmas 
    holidays to reaffirm friendships. They are _personal_. They aren't used 
    for establishing new relationships. They are for reaffirming existing 
    ones. And yet here was Dan Quayle trying to get all chummy with me when 
    I've never even seen him person, much less shook his hand or talked to 
    him. 

    Isn't it just like a politician to use a time-honored tradition like 
    the exchange of Chirstmas cards to wheedle himself into your life? 
    Does Dan Quayle really expect me to think I have some sort of personal 
    rapport with him now? 

    And it's not just Dan Quayle. The more I began to think about this, the 
    more I thought of other instances of this abuse. Last year, I got 
    "Season's Greetings" from my insurance agent too. Just for the record. 
    I have never, ever, met my State Farm insurance agent. He stays walled 
    off behind an army of secretaries, who have always handled taking my 
    money and updating my account information, etc. I expect I'll get 
    another card from him this year. And just like last year there will be 
    a chummy, smiling picture of him and a sentimental message from him on 
    the inside like we were long-lost soul mates or something. Bah! Humbug! 

    I have also received Chirstmas Greetings from real estate agents whom 
    I've never met, churches of which I've never darkened the doorstep, and 
    many businesses which I've never patronized. To all of whom I just want 
    to say, "Bug Off!" 

    Just for the record. if I've never met you before, if I don't already 
    know your name, if we haven't had conversations before, preferably in 
    person, if you don't know me well enough to know that I'm not offended 
    by Christian symbols (or Jewish ones, or whatever religion you happen 
    to celebrate), then please please please do not, under any 
    circumstances, send me a Chirstmas card. 

    It's people who have no respect for the sacred Chirstmas traditions 
    and try to abuse them for their own purposes that make Chirstmas seem 
    cheap and sleazy. You would expect a Republican conservative, of all 
    people, to understand the sacredness of such social institutions. But 
    Dan Quayle sure didn't. And as far as I'm concerned, it's blasphemy. 

    ==================================
                            True Story
    A Modern Barn Raising
  
    Remeber on "Little House On The Prarie" when new folk moved into the 
    area to settle, all the neighbors would show up one day and help the 
    new family build their barn? It seemed so wholesomely good that it 
    almost hurt to watch. It seemed like something out of an ancient era. 
    On TV it didn't seem like real life. 

    But it was, I think. And it still is. The only thing that's changed is 
    the fact that not too many people have the need to build a barn these days. 

    But even today, with all the modern conveniences that we have at our 
    finger-tips, despite the combustion engine, despite electricity, we 
    still occasionally have jobs to do that we can't do ourselves. 

    For example, when we move from one place to another, there is far too 
    much stuff to move all at once for people to do it alone. It takes a 
    bunch of people to pack up all the trappings of a home neatly into 
    boxes and haul them someplace to the new home. 

    Folks of means can hire professional movers to do the job for them. But 
    for many, many folks, the cost is way to high. So what are they to do? 
    Should they just ditch most of their stuff. There's a certain appeal to 
    that I suppose. But our Modern Lifestyles require that we own a bunch 
    of stuff, that requires being moved from place to pkace on occasion. 

    So we rely on our friends to help us move. A couple of weeks ago I 
    helped a friend of mine move out of her apartment  and into a new one 
    down the street. And in some ways I felt like Charles Ingalls helping a 
    new neighbor build their barn. 

    The first step was to go rent the truck. For various reasons, my friend 
    didn't want to drive the truck herself, so I was the lucky one! At first 
    I was a little scared. She said that the only truck available from the 
    rental place that weekend was a 26 foot truck. That's big! Way bigger than 
    she needed, but that's all that was available. And it was sure bigger 
    than anything I had ever driven before. As it turned out, there was a 
    smaller truck available. And I was surpridingly disappointed. I had 
    worked up my gumption to drive that huge thing. But the truck we rented 
    was still a pretty darn big truck. And driving it was great fun! You sit 
    way up high in the truck looking down on all the puny cars around you. 
    And you have to make huge big sweeping turns and you have to constantly 
    watch all four corners of the truck to make sure you don't hit anything. 
    And the steering wheel is huge and you have to make big turns. You really 
    feel like you're steering!

    So we drove the truck back to her apartment and parked it just outside 
    the entrance. As fate would have it, there was another moving truck 
    parked near the entrance because someone else was moving into that 
    building the same day.  

    The people in the other truck were professionals. Everything was neatly 
    and securely packed. Every single peice of furniture had been carefully 
    wrapped with blankets and bubble wrap. They were using professional 
    equipment to roll the stuff around. The hired hands were wearing back 
    supports. These folks were serious. These folks knew what they were 
    doing. These folks were pros. 

    We on the other hand, looked more like a scene from a bizarre "Bad News 
    Bears" movie. My friend had assembled a rag tag collection of boxes 
    and had spent the previous week dumping stuff into them. So they were 
    all sorts of shapes and sizes and weights. I had brought a hand cart 
    with me so we started out by loading up the cart with various boxes and 
    carting them out to the truck. The only problem was that stuff kept 
    falling off. And the first three trips out to the van I accidently 
    tipped the handcart over while navigating it down the sidewalk, 
    spilling the contents of my friends personal life all over the street. 
    (She swears that nothing got broken execpt a single coffee mug, but I 
    don't know if I believe her.)

    Anyway, by the fourth load, I began to get the hang of it and we 
    managed to get all her "boxed" belongings into the truck. Now, instead 
    of packing for maximum safety and efficiency, we were packing for 
    maximum convenience. In other words, we were just throwing stuff in 
    anywhere. Her new apartment was just a few blocks away, so we figured 
    we'd just move the boxes first and then come back for the furniture. 
    Hey, there's no sense in getting all stressed out about it, was there? 
    So off we went, bumping and rattling stuff all the way. 

    By the time we got the stuff unloaded at the new apartment and got back 
    to the old apartment for round two, some other friends began to show up. 
    A good thing too because now it was time to move the big stuff like the 
    cabinets, and the sofas. I couldn't tell you how we got all that stuff 
    out of her old apartment, down the elevator, into the truck, and then in 
    through the narrow doors of her new place, but we did. Ever watched a 
    swarm of ants attacking a big piece of bread? The just swarm all over 
    it and the next thing you know, it's gone. Well, we were sort of like 
    that. Everybody did some little something. Everybody heaved together on 
    the really heavy stuff. No one leading anyone else. No one in charge. 
    No one had a plan. We just did it and then it was done. 

    When we were done, my friend bought everyone pizza and beer and we 
    sat around and visited and sort of christened the new place. There was 
    no square dancing.

    But it was the most fun I've had in weeks.

    Why "Stuck In Traffic"?
  
    Because getting stuck in traffic is good for you. It's an  
    opportunity to think, ponder, and reflect on all things, from the 
    personal to the global. As Robert Pirsig wrote in _Zen and the 
    Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_,  "Let's consider a reevaluation of 
    the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, 
    the zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible 
    situations, but the best possible situation you could be in.  After 
    all, it's exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much 
    trouble to induce...."
