    My Favorite Comic
                                          
    Of the comic strips currently being published, my favorite is
    Calvin and Hobbes.  Calvin is something of a role model for me.
    He's the alter ego I never had, but wish I did.  Calvin is the
    center of his own half-real, half-imaginary world.  He's the Don
    Quixote of the grade school crowd, tilting at modern-day
    windmills, getting in trouble only when reality rears its humdrum
    head.  You have to understand that I was entirely too well behaved
    as a child.  I am not proud of this.  So Calvin and Hobbes, for
    me, is a blue print for the childhood I should have had.
                                          
    With the possible exception of pelting little girls with
    snowballs, Calvin is not intentionally malicious.  He can't help
    it if the mistakenly sees his math teacher as an evil slime
    monster from Venus.  If his vegetables turn in to a carnivorous
    ooze, who can blame him for throwing them across the dinner table
    in disgust?  He's inventive.  Scientific progress goes Boink!  He
    an adventurer!  Spaceman Spiff to the rescue!
                                          
                                          
    But my all-time favorite comic strip is the now defunct Bloom
    County.  Berke Breathed had a knack for gently poking fun at our
    modern day foibles without being insulting like so many comics
    strips are today.  And Bloom County is far less shrill and far
    less cynical than Doonesbury.  Like the best comic strips always
    do, the characters in Bloom County rang so true that you could
    think of real people that were exactly like the personalities of
    the cartoon characters.  Even its darkest, most cynical moments,
    Bloom County had a deep underlying sense of optimism.
                                          
    I'll never forget the Bloom County political scene, with it's
    "Meadow Party" running a drunk and a Penguin for it's Presidential
    ticket or Steve Dallas imitating Julio Iglesias in the Shower.
    Who can forget Cutter John?  To my knowledge he's the first
    handicapped (wheelchair bound) cartoon character to play a major
    role in a comic strip.  Remember when he, Opus, and the other
    meadow critters used to play Star Trek on Cutter John's wheel
    chair searching the galaxy for the Forbidden Planet of Bimbos?
    Remember Binkley and his infamous closet of anxieties?  Remember
    how he used to wake his dad up in the middle of the night worried
    about the latest Hollywood gossip?  And then there's Milo.  You
    know I could never quite figure out how old Milo was supposed to
    be.  Certainly he seemed younger than Steve Dallas and Cutter John
    but he didn't seem like a kid either.  I used to love how he'd
    make up stories with outlandish headlines for the Bloom County
    newspaper.  But my favorite Milo based strip was a Sunday issue
    where he walks up to the Lost and Found counter at a Sears store
    and asks, "Excuse me, I seem to have lost my sense of optimism.
    Have you seen it?"  And of course there's everyone's insecurities
    personified, Opus.  He's the road-kill of pop-culture.  He's the
    victim of Ginsu knife commercials.  He's the orphan in all of us.
    He's the flightless bird in all of us.  He's the Romantic we keep
    hidden away in our psyche.

    "Even with the explosion from the grass roots, there's still going
    to be a need for mass culture, for truly great entertainment that
    transcends all the little niches and links people together."

    Stamp Act 1995
                                          
    The U.S.  Postal Service wants to control your e-mail.  It has
    recently unveiled a plan that would but electronic versions of a
    U.S.  postmark on e-mail.  From a recent story written by Darren
    Chervitz for the San Francisco Examiner:
                                          
    "`The electronic postmark is the first step in transforming these
    incredible electronic networks into official pathways of
    communication,' says Robert Reisner; vice-president of technology
    applications for the Postal Service.
                                          
    Reisner said the Postal Service is negotiating with software
    companies and computer networks like America Online to offer the
    postmark service, which would involve stamping electronic messages
    with a private digital signature.
                                          
    The postmark, which would be embedded in commercially available
    software, would help certify e-mail and protect the privacy of
    customers, securing one company's market-sensitive information
    against prying eyes from competitors, for example, the agency
    said."
                                          
    Baloney.
                                          
    First of all, there is nothing the U.S.  Postal Service can do
    that isn't already available to anyone that wants it.  There are
    many low-cost ways to secure e-mail, certify its authenticity, and
    protect the privacy of the contents already.  And they don't
    require a government bureaucracy to implement.
                                          
    Second of all, the article makes clear that the electronic
    postmark would give e-mail all `the same legal protections against
    fraud that regular mail has.'  Maybe, but there is a heavy price
    for that protection.  It also means that all the government
    restrictions on mail will be enforced as well.  Mark my words, the
    day will come when the government declares electronic mail to be
    part of the postal monopoly.  The government will try to tax us
    for each message we send to others.  Furthermore, the government
    will assure us that it will only read our mail with `due
    authority'.
                                          
    Finally, of course, the government doesn't propose to `protect' us
    for free.  Oh no.  Reisner made it perfectly clear that the Postal
    Service intends to charge for this service.  While he would name a
    specific price.  He noted that current commercial services charge
    between 75 cents and $1.50 to certify e-mail.
                                          
    It's kind of sad actually to see the Postal Service trying to drag
    itself into the Information Age.  But mostly it's scary.

    Notes About An Obscure Field Of The Performing Arts
                                          
    Imagine for a moment a girl in her senior year of high-school.
    And imagine that she has discovered the theater and more than
    anything else she wants to be a dramatic actress.  Her dream is to
    be a star on Broadway.  Academics don't interest her that much.
    Though not openly hostile to them, she's just not very interested.
    Her dream is acting.
                                          
                                          
    What advice does a her highschool counselor offer her?  Can you
    imagine a counselor who tries to talk her out of pursuing a career
    in acting?  Can you imagine a highschool counsellor telling her,
    "You know that only a tiny fraction of people who pursue a career
    in acting are ever able to support themselves with acting.
    Perhaps you should choose another career, one that's safer, on
    that you can be assured of supporting yourself with."
                                          
    What if her parents discourage her from pursuing her dream?  What
    if they tell her, "Society just doesn't respect actors and
    actresses.  You should train for a career that's respectable.  You
    can always enjoy acting as a hobby."  Would you think of her
    parents?
                                          
    Suppose, despite the negative feedback from her parents and
    counsellors, this young woman decides to pursue acting anyway.
    She wants to go to college to learn more about acting, and the
    theater, and all aspects of putting on dramatic theater.  Suppose
    every college she tries to get into tells her, "Sorry, you can't
    pursue acting as a career.  It's not an subject worthy of this
    institution.  You can, if you like, pursue acting as a strictly
    extracurricular activity.  As am amateur endeavor."  Suppose all
    colleges treated acting this way?  What would this young woman do?
                                          
    She would probably look around at all the colleges that had the
    best opportunities for learning about the theater and enroll in
    it.  Not as a theater major of course, since the college won't let
    her.  Instead, she'll pick the easiest major she can find, say,
    Communications or Sociology.  Or perhaps some major that has a
    tangential relationship to her intended career.
                                          
    So off she goes to her chosen college, on paper at least she's
    going to get a `respectable' education in a `respectable' subject.
    But her heart is still set on becoming an actress of the grandest
    proportions.
                                          
    Imagine that, as you would probably expect, this young woman pays
    only minimal attention to her declared major.  She spends all her
    time at rehearsals for her the plays that her amateur theater
    group puts on.  Her grades are mediocre at best.  But she earns a
    reputation for becoming a promising actress.  But instead of being
    lauded for her talents, most people look down their noses at her.
    "What's she doing wasting her time trying to pursue this foolish
    career of acting?  Doesn't she realize that only a very small
    handful of people ever make successful careers in acting?  And
    doesn't she realize that even the best actresses have relatively
    short careers?  She's throwing her life away!"
                                          
    And imagine that society in general shuns even the most successful
    actresses.  "They make too much money!  It's obscene that actors
    make such incredible amounts of money for mere entertainment!"
                                          
    Can you picture the incredible gumption and perseverance this
    young woman would have to have to pursue her career in light of
    such obstacles?  I would say it's borderline criminal.  As a
    society, we should be encouraging people to follow their dreams,
    no matter how fanciful, unrealistic, or "unsafe" they may seem.
                                          
    "But," you may respond, "we don't treat the acting profession in
    this way."  But we _do_ treat at least one career path this way.
    In case you don't recognize it by now, I'm talking about
    Athletics.
                                          
    I fail to understand why we treat athletes as second class
    citizens when it comes to their career.  I'm unable to discern the
    fine reasoning that would classify Acting as a reasonable endeavor
    for a career and worthy of pursuit at an institute of higher
    learning but would classify Athletics as an unsuitable field of
    study.
                                          
    Are Athletes any less earnest about their dreams?  Do Athletic
    endeavors not take the same dedication, practice, and gumption
    that any other artistic field?  And while it's true that only a
    very small percentage of the people who attempt a career in
    Athletics ever make a living from it, this does not mean that
    athletes shouldn't be allowed to try.  Besides, professional
    Athletics is a huge industry with many opportunities for the
    Athlete past his prime.  Just as there are many
    not-quite-successful artists making the rounds of starving artist
    shows, just as there are many unsuccessful actors and actresses
    making a living on the business side of the theater, just as many
    a would be novelist makes a living editing technical manuals,
    athletes that don't hit the big-time can earn a living by coaching
    others, by training other athletes, by promoting sporting events,
    by running the business side of sports teams.
                                          
    It's time that colleges dropped their pretensions and allow
    students to declare a major in Athletics.  Let them study their
    sport just like the rest of the students are allowed to study
    theirs.  Let them study about the business side of their industry.
    Let them study the basics of contract law so they can represent
    themselves.  Let them study nutrition, sports medicine, and
    physical training so they can get the most out of their talents.
    Let them follow their dreams, wherever they lead.  Any institution
    that stands in the way of a person pursuing their dreams is sick
    and needs to be changed.

    Marketplace of the Future
                                          
    The Information Age as been aptly named.  It is the driving force
    behind most progress of recent decades.  Certainly there has been
    a great explosion in the sheer amount of information being
    produced as well as the quality of that information, in terms of
    usefulness.
                                          
    But there is another aspect of the Information Age that has
    perhaps been underlooked slightly, and that is the huge increase
    in the efficiency of propagating information.  It's getting to the
    point where you can tell anyone anywhere anything, at costs so low
    as to become borderline insignificant.  And we see the effects of
    this increased efficiency in some of the big stories.  Not only do
    we have on the spot news coverage of breaking stories with CNN
    etc.  but we get word-of-mouth news propagation almost as fast and
    efficiently.
                                          
    During the worst of the Rwandan refugee crisis, there was a doctor
    working as a volunteer in one of the camps who was faxing first
    hand accounts of the tragedy to friends and relatives to a bar in
    New York.  During China's failed struggle for freedom, fax
    networks, satellite news feeds and international telephone lines
    played a key role in keeping the freedom movement alive.  And I
    don't think there's anyone who could dispute the fact that
    television coverage of the events was what prevented wholesale
    carnage in Tianamen Square.  The Chiapas uprising has been
    publicized more on the Internet than in the news media.  (I don't
    know if it still exists, but for a while, there was a WorldWideWeb
    Home page for the Indigenous peoples of Mexico) A recent issue of
    Wired magazine had a story about the Czech Republic's struggle to
    throw off totalitarian rule.  During the worst of the turmoil, an
    unidentified Japanese man somehow showed up in Prague with a case
    full of cheap modems to help the democracy movement there set up a
    communications network of sorts.  No one knows how the man got
    there or even what his name was, but people suspect he was somehow
    affiliated with the Japanese government.
                                          
    Governments are getting smart about this sort of thing too and now
    we have Made-for-TV wars like the Somalia "mission" and the Haiti
    invasion.  Call it Soap Opera News if you will.  Nonetheless, the
    point remains, there's a very short distance between you and the
    news these days, thanks to the Information Age.
                                          
    OK.  OK.  I know this isn't exactly an earth shattering
    revelation.  Even Time magazine has had a cover story on this
    subject.
                                          
    But what fascinates me, and what isn't talked about so much, is
    the effects this vast increase in the efficiency of transmitting
    information will do to our daily lives.  And in particular, how
    will it affect markets?  Today, the stock market can rise and fall
    minute by minute based on up to the minute events from all over
    the world.  No doubt when a Colombian coffee bean farmer has the
    sniffles, the price of coffee stocks rise or fall appropriately.
                                          
    And as more and more people get plugged into this up to the minute
    changing stream of information, how will it affect us?  Will we
    shop in the future they way stocks are traded today?  Well why
    not?  I can imagine a day in the future where we will buy and sell
    options to buy a box of Wheaties at the corner grocery.  I can
    imagine a day when we will place electronic bids for razor blades
    and see which merchant will sell them to us for that price.  And
    if I run out of blades for someone accepts my bid?  Well, I'll
    just have to raise my bid then.  I live for the day where I can
    publish my shopping list online someplace and send it out to the
    merchants in my area as a "Request for Bid."  As the bids come in,
    I can decide which one I want to accept and close the deal with
    whoever offers me the best price.  I don't just want "pay per
    view" movies on cable.  I want "pay by the minute" TV that way a
    true marketplace in the TV arena will emerge.  I want competition
    in Telephone companies.  I want to pick up a phone, dial a long
    distance number and have multiple long distance phone companies
    bid on that call.  (And I want my phone to automatically select
    the company with the lowest bid.)  No more calling circles, reach
    out plans, package deals, volume discounts.  Just place a bid on
    my call.
                                          
    People usually talk about the benefits of the Information Age as a
    corporate tool for increasing margins and increasing corporate
    profits.  But I think the Information Age can give the average Joe
    an economic boost as well.

    A Ghost Story
                                          
    I have seen a ghost, but I don't believe in them.
                                          
    One Saturday afternoon, I was walking through the living room, in
    a hurry for some reason, and out of the corner of my eye, in the
    center of the living room, I saw a ghost.  I only saw it for a
    brief second, But I swear to you I could see it as clear as day,
    in minute detail.  It was the ghost of a tall man, dressed in a
    black and white tuxedo of a past era.  He was standing very tall,
    stiff, and straight.  He looked as if he were standing at
    attention or posing for a formal portrait or something.  He was
    slightly turned to one side, but his head was turned facing me,
    looking directly at me.  He looked very serious and maybe in a
    little bit of pain.  He didn't look like he was trying to be
    scary.  He was just standing there.  But I freaked.  The hair
    stood up on the back of my neck and I got this huge rush of
    adrenaline and an urge to run out the front door.  It only lasted
    a second or two, but it shook me up for hours.
                                          
    The ghost, as it turned out, was a pile of brown boxes.  A few
    months ago I had brought home 4 large empty boxes from work to
    store my ever growing pile of magazines in.  The boxes were
    stacked up in the middle of the floor in the main room of my
    house.  And like most projects I start, I never quite get around
    to finishing up.  As a result, those boxes sat in my living room
    for weeks and weeks.  They had essentially become a 4-5 foot tall
    piece of furniture that I no longer paid attention to.  I've read
    about how the brain is able to fill in the details of things we
    don't notice too clearly and I think this is what happened to me.
    I think that the stack of boxes caught my eye as I was walking
    through the room but I didn't get a good enough glimpse of them to
    register in my brain.  So my mind just made something up to
    explain the image.
                                          
    I've also read that some researchers are hypothesizing that dreams
    are essentially the same thing.  During sleep, your brain goes
    through phases were it sends out burst of seemingly random signals
    through the brain.  No one knows why this happens.  But some
    researchers are hypothesizing that dreaming is what happens when
    your brain tries to interpret these random signals and it fills in
    the details as best it can using your memories etc.
                                          
    But there's a world of difference between reading about this
    phenomena and experiencing it!  The thing that blows my mind about
    this incident was the intensity of the experience.  I really could
    feel the presence of this ghost in the room.  And for that brief
    instant, I could see every single detail of this ghost, down to
    the buttons on his coat.  And while the rational side of me looks
    on this incident as a failing, a losing touch with reality,
    there's also a part of me that is amazed an fascinated that our
    minds have this incredible capability.
                 

    =============================
    A Public Service Announcement
                                          
    I would like to think of myself as someone who is basically
    earnest and helpful, who doesn't have to be asked to do his fair
    share of the work.  Perhaps I'm fooling myself by thinking I
    posses this quality to any significant degree, but I hope not.
                                          
    Since the last issue of The Junto, I have, on more than one
    occasion, been manipulated and unkindly made use of by another
    individual.  Being used in this manner always hurts, no matter the
    circumstances.  But what made this incident particularly
    distressing is that this person used this positive trait of being
    helpful AGAINST me in order to reduce that person's workload as
    much as possible.  In other words, the more this person could
    manipulate me into volunteering, the less that individual had to
    do.  Call it a social form of Judo.  In fact, looking back on the
    incident, I believe this person deliberately tried to see just how
    far I could be pushed.
                                          
    At the time this happened, I couldn't verbalize my feelings.  But
    it definitely didn't feel right.  I was angry at myself.  I was
    telling myself, "You're such a wimp!  How did you get yourself
    into this mess?  Why isn't anyone else in this situation?  Why are
    you the only one helping out?"  It wasn't until several days
    later, after much introspection, that I realized the problem
    wasn't an inherent character flaw in myself, but rather that I had
    been the victim of a cruel though skillful manipulation.  The very
    trait that I had once been proud of, but had been angry at when
    this incident occurred, was STILL something to be proud of.  The
    thing to be angry at was the person who had played this deceitful
    trick.
                                          
    I publicize this incident in The Junto, not to solicit sympathy
    nor to lobby others to pass judgement on the incident in my favor.
    Indeed, I have no intention of going into the details at all.
    You'll just have to proceed on the assumption that I'm giving an
    accurate accounting of the facts.  I'm writing about it here for
    two reasons.  First, putting it down on paper forces me to
    conceptualize the situation and engrave it into my brain so that,
    hopefully, I'll be better prepared to avoid it next time.  Second,
    well, think of it as a sort of Public Service Announcement to my
    friends so they may benefit from my bad experiences.
                                          
                                          
       A Public Service Announcement To My Friends: 
                                          
    While most people naturally remain distrustful of strangers for
    fear that they may be a mugger or thief, many people aren't aware
    that the most insidious and sinister of threats can come from
    well-known individuals, often posing as acquaintances and even
    friends.  These people are particularly versed at a style of
    stealing known as Passive Aggressiveness and can steal a person's
    time and talents, often without the victims even being aware.
                                          
    The Passive-Aggressive perpetrator is characterized by always
    speaking in Passive voice, never volunteering action, but creating
    a void for action which they hope you will fall into.  Thus
    creating a trap for their `friends' to fall into.  If a friend of
    yours starts using lots of passive verbs in their speech and
    laments about work `that needs to be done' or `ought to be done'
    or `will have to be done by somebody' Beware!  You are being
    approached by a Passive-Aggressive thief.  Don't speak.  Let the
    huge pauses remain empty and silent.  Let the conversation drag
    and slowly pass you by.  Those passive verbs and awkward silences
    are the jaws of death and must be avoided at all costs if you are
    to remain free from the clutches of the Passive Aggressive.
    Should you feel an overwhelming desire to enter the conversation,
    RUN!, don't walk to the nearest fallout shelter.  Crouch on the
    floor with your face on the ground and your hands behind your
    neck.  Close your eyes and hum your favorite tune until either the
    Passive-Aggressive perpetrator has left the vicinity or you no
    longer feel the urge to converse with the perpetrator.

    Stupid Is As Stupid Does
                                          
    Since Forrest Gump cleaned up at the Oscar's, and since certain
    friends of mine, who shall remain nameless to save them
    embarrassment, refuse to go see the movie, I thought I'd reprint a
    review of Forrest Gump I originally wrote for Claustrophobia
    magazine.
                                          
    Forrest Gump chronicles the extraordinary life of a man
    handicapped with an unusually low IQ from his early childhood in
    the 40's through the '80s.  But it's far from being a standard
    wise-fool movie because we don't just see the world through
    Forrest's eyes.  Racial desegregation, the Vietnam War, the peace
    movement, multiple presidential assassination attempts, the drugs
    and disco scene, Watergate and the health and fitness craze all
    serve as chaotic backdrops to show us how well he and the people
    close to him handled those turbulent decades.  Some people made
    their own destiny.  Others didn't.  Forrest Gump is a movie about
    what it takes to make your own destiny in a world filled with
    chaos.
                                          
    Tom Hanks masterfully plays Forrest, who's geeky appearance,
    awkward mannerisms, and heavy, slow southern drawl immediately
    make him the target of local bullies in his rural Alabama home
    town.  Apparently doomed to a life "special schools" and
    persecution, Forrest's future doesn't look too bright.  Sally
    Fields nicely plays his mother who accepts that her son is 'a
    little slow', but believes her destiny is to see that Forrest has
    the same opportunities as everyone else.  And she takes drastic
    measures to ensure that Forrest gets admitted to the "regular"
    schools".  But more importantly, she teaches Forrest those
    fundamental values that the rest of the world only pays lip
    service to.  As Forrest says, "Mama always had a way of explaining
    things so that I could understand them."  On the other hand,
    there's Jenny, Forrest's first friend and on-again-off-again
    girlfriend played by Robin Wright.  Haunted by her father's abuse,
    she is ill-prepared to deal with the crazy times ahead of her and
    is never quite able to put her troubled past behind.
                                          
    Forrest is then better prepared to deal with life better than
    Jenny is.  Because his mama taught him self-respect he is able to
    treat others with respect.  While George Wallace and President
    Kennedy are having a showdown over the desegregation issue at the
    University of Alabama, Forrest immediately and unquestioningly
    accepting the two black students trying to enroll.  After all, his
    mama told him, "Don't let anyone ever tell you that you are any
    different from anyone else."  Meanwhile, Jenny's lack of
    self-respect gets her caught-up on the bad side of the sexual
    revolution and eventually thrown out of school.
                                          
    During the worst of the Vietnam War, Forrest joins the Army, more
    by default than conscious decision.  Jenny gets caught up in the
    fad and fashion of the peace movement.  Forrest's simple, literal
    interpretation of everything around him and his intense loyalty to
    others turn him into a model soldier earning him the congressional
    medal of honor, a future business partner and a friend for life.
    Jenny on the other hand falls into the hippie subculture filled
    with lots of revolutionary slogans, mean spirited stereotyping.
    She moves from one place to the next, abandoning her friends at
    the drop of a hat.
                                          
    And after the war, Forrest is determined to buy a shrimp boat and
    start a business because he promised a fellow platoon member,
    Bubba, to do so.  It didn't matter to Forrest that Bubba had died
    in the fighting.  His mama had taught him to always keep his
    promises.  On the other hand, Jenny has sunken into heavy drugs
    and stealing from one-night stands to get by.  While the rest of
    the country seems to be caught up in a frenzy of snorting cocaine
    in discoteques, Forrest is fighting hurricanes in the Gulf of
    Mexico, trying to get his business off the ground.  He eventually
    does with the help of his former commanding officer, whom Forrest
    saved, both physically and emotionally.
                                          
    Time and again, Forrest succeeds in his world-gone-crazy
    surroundings where others fail because self-respect, loyalty,
    discipline, and long-term dedication are the only things he
    understands.  But what about love?  Despite all his successes, the
    toughest one of all to achieve is his love for Jenny.  And Forrest
    can't really feel like the master of his own destiny without
    Jenny.  Are the simple things his mama taught him enough to win
    Jenny's love in a crazy world?  Yes.  No.  Maybe.  Depends on how
    you look at it.
                                          
    But one thing's for sure.  Because Forrest Gump stuck to the
    fundamentals that the rest of society seems all too often to
    ignore, he had no regrets.  So it's highly ironic that people kept
    asking Forrest throughout the movie, "Are you crazy or just plain
    stupid?"  To which he always replies, as his mama taught him,
    "Stupid is as stupid does."  You got that right Forrest.
                            
    ==========================
    So THAT's Their Secret!
                                          
    The AP news service ran an article about David Weeks, a
    psychologist from the University of Edinburg who has been studying
    "eccentrics" for over 10 years.  His conclusions after 10 years of
    study?  Eccentrics are happier than normal people.
                                          
    And he poses an interesting question:  "Why should we continue to
    groom ourselves properly and comport ourselves according to social
    convention while those who flout convention seem to be having the
    time of their life?"
                                          
    But there's hope for normal folk.  According to Mr.  Weeks, people
    can learn to become an eccentric.  He suggests that people wanting
    to become an eccentric first quit their job.  Because they need a
    lot of leisure time.  Who would have thought?
                                          
    The closest I've ever come to meeting real live eccentrics has
    been at science fiction conventions where there are more than just
    a few people who are half-in and half out of this world.  But they
    see themselves as perfectly normal and refer to the rest of the
    world as `the mundanes.'  I like it.
