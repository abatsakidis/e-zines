---=[ Introduction ]=----------------------------------------------------------

      Welcome to The Week in Warez Newsletter issue #6.  This week I'm
       sorry to say Mercury will be leaving the WWN crew for his lack of
       freetime, read his goodbye letter in this issue.  This weeks
       interview is with Count Zero the founder of Pinnacle.  This week
       there is no Warez Report from Bishop for a reason i do not know.
       If anyone can supply a warez report similar to Bishop's please
       contact me through E-Mail or on iRC. Hope you enjoy this issue.

Biased utils report for WWN #6 issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Originally created by Jimmy Jamez


      Hot summer just finished. It was flagged with Windows 95 sign
       and in the end of this hot days we finally got all cool shit we
       wanted for a long time.  Past week was not that busy as previous
       but anyway we saw few awaited titles.  Also wanna mention many
       surprises happened like major dupes from PNC and few big rips from
       evil dead Prophecy. I am pretty tired after busy work day now and
       will not write huge descriptions.. will just show you week groups
       positions.

      DOD (Drink Or Die) - my group had some rest after kicking-ass
       Windows 95 time. Anyway we had few nice utils like Novell Word
       Perfect Internet Publisher, final release of Microsoft Project 4.1
       for Win95, Visio 3.0a Network/Computer Shapes (specialized
       technical symbols for Visio 3.0a), long awaited store title - Lotus
       Word Pro 96 Final on 15 disks, very cool tcp/ip utility - 3000
       Connection for WRQ 5.01 for Windows and in the last day - awesome
       eXcursions 1.2a-2 for Win95/NT (c) Digital Equipment. That can be
       very cool week for any group except DOD. Drink or Die posse can do
       better and they will not get maximum points this week. Hope it will
       stimulate my dudes to work their asses off soon.

       Week Score :  08/10
       Total Score:  35/40

      PWA (Pirates With Attitude) - of coz the leader of past week.
       They were slow during Windows 95 release marathon but activated
       their forces now. Of coz main hit of scene dinosaurs is new Watcom
       C/C++ Compiler 10.5 for Windows 95.  It is huge but it is awesome!
       If you would like to code anything without any programming skills -
       use Watcom and you will code smth like Word or Excel in a few hours
       :) It was definitely programming/developing week for PWA - they
       also released 14 disks software called CA-Telon PWS 2.3, Visual
       Basic 4.0 that they claimed final but nobody compared it with DOD
       one yet.  And in the very end of the week our beta-kings presented
       Borland Delphi 32-bit Beta for Win95. Don't know who will use it
       coz Delphi is already called unsuc- cessfull dbase/programming
       language, but anyway this is elite Borland inside ware. Cool points
       finally!

       Week Score :  10/10
       Total Score:  30/40

      PNC (PiNNACLe) - shame on you kids! all you need to succeed -
       better supply organization. We finally saw this young posse duping,
       and duping a lot :) 3 of 4 releases on past week were dupes such
       as: Mosaic in a Box CD - 3 days after DOD release, Visual FoxPro
       3.0 - dupe of DOD release (still dont know what version they
       duped.. they forgot to tell that :) and the lamest dupe is MS Plus!
       CD (c'mon dudes.. how much more we will see this released?) Hope
       this will not continue in future coz it can kill this team's
       potential!  Only good thing happened in the last day of week - Some
       Netscape util for Windows NT on 4 disks. had no chance to look on
       it yet and HOPE it is not DUPE too :) keep stones rolling

       Week Score :  03/10
       Total Score:  26/40

      NTA/X-FORCE released nothing serious so we will not review them
       in this issue! Also all PNT titles are not yet checked and me and
       my friends think that all their 3DS meshes and stuff were ripped
       from old ViewPoint CD If we are mistaken - we will count this in
       next volume of WWN. If not - do not take offense, it is complicated
       to fool me about your release.  Nothing else serious happened and i
       will say bye bye to all WWN readers..  Expect better week, boys..
       we will work for it.

      PS. Noticed some activity from such unknown groups like TiTAN
       and ILLUSION.  Work better to be in my review next time :)

X-Net Preface:
==============

      X-Net is a completely unique network that's forming... The
       original idea was brought up a long time ago (Early 1995) with 
       the original intention being to cut down on netsplits, channel
       takeovers, etc.  Back then, myself nor others had much time nor
       motivation to help people get switched over (If they wanted to). 
       I suspect the whole conflict back then was lack of time on most
       peoples' part.  Now that more and more people are coming back on
       the net (new school year, etc.), there is once again a need to do
       some sort of reforming.  With the "new" X-Net there are more people
       that have time to put work into it, more stable servers than
       before, a new look and style, and more.

      The objective of X-Net is to provide an alternative, yet VERY
       unique, IRC Network to whomever wants to join.  Reasons why IRCers
       may want to switch over from the standard IRC Network (EFNet) is to
       eliminate the lame channel takeovers, the constant netsplits, the
       Hitler-like IRC Operator attitudes, to provide their channel with
       an extra service(s) (You'll learn all about this at a later date,
       when the net is ready to accept connections...), etc.

      This is just a brief introduction about X-Net. To find out more
       information, help out with the formation/services/etc., simply
       email me.

                 " Join Undernet! "
                by Lifendel

      I sat there on Friday night for about 3 hours jumping from
       server to server on EFnet trying to hold a steady connection, and
       to aviod as many netsplits as possible... It wasn't working. Just
       as soon as I'd say hi to someone, the damn net would split.
       The EFnet's been getting progressivly worse for the past couple
       of months to the point where servers are inaccessable. I watched
       irc.virginia.edu split for over 6 hours. How the hell are you
       supposed to talk with someone much less send them a file if #1 they
       are split, and #2 your lag is ?.....

      Many people don't care much for my suggestion. They hate the
       undernet for reasons that I'm not aware of.. I guess it's because
       of all the "lamers" there. WAKE UP PEOPLE!! We're flooded with them
       here on EFnet!! There's just not as many of them on the undernet.

      Communication between the 2 nets is easy enough.. Eggdrops can
       be connected between the 2 nets for those hardcord EFnetters so
       they can be in both places at once without opening another window.
       Bot's are allowed on over half of the undernet's servers. And it
       is NOT monitored except for clonebots (they'll k-line you for
       clones, so watch it).

      It will take a while for the traffic to build up to even what
       half of EFnet's traffic is, but hopefully, this will ease the load
       on EFnet's servers some (doubtful though).  I've slowly been
       hanging out more and more on the undernet, and intend to move and
       stay there shortly. I'm sick of the splits. And I'm sick of the
       hacks. I think it's time to start over. It's time to pop to a new
       net try to reestablish what we started years ago.

      I'm still open to suggestions on other nets besides undernet. At
       the moment, undernet already had a small warez community that's
       steadly getting larger. Let's go give them a hand..  Hop over to
       undernet.org and find a link nearest you. Create your channel, or
       hop on #warez. Try it out for a while. You'll find it a hell of a
       lot more enjoyable...

                 " The Unification "
                 by Lord of Darkness
      
      Unification is not a new concept, but it has recently become a
       topic that is often talked about.  What is unification?
       Unification is the mother of all groups, the ruler of the scene,
       and the single force that drives the computer underground.  There
       have been many mixed feeling about unifying the pirate scene into
       one large organization.  Some people say it will not work because
       competition is what drives the industry.  Others just have egos
       that are too big for their own good, and they wish to continue
       running their own group.  Orion, the president of PWA, mentioned a
       unified group in his recent interview.  Of course it is possible.
       I have had the idea in my head for years.  It sounds like a
       wonderful idea in your head and on paper, but it just may not work
       in practice.  A unified group must have it's own army of couriers,
       suppliers, coders, artists, coordinators and sysops.  Plus a
       super-group cannot go on without providing full support for their
       products, since the people have no where else to turn.  Almost all
       other groups will be given a choice.  Give us your best members, or
       get crushed by our superior power.  Everyone will want to join the
       unified group, because that's pretty much it.  The group will have
       to be run by a responsible council of seniors that make all the
       major decisions, then report to the group leaders.  The leaders
       must have the power to veto any decisions made, of course.  The
       group must be run with the purpose of providing for the scene and
       to ensure quality.  Don't forget you are here to have fun as well.

      Chaos theory suggest that such a group will easily be broken
       apart in no time.  To ensure that does not happen, the group
       leaders must always be in control of what happens.  One must not
       allow sub-groups to be formed within the organization.  This will
       cause a separation and unification will exist no more.  An ideal
       person to lead the job is Mikeysoft, one of the most respected
       pirates alive in the scene, often referred to as "grandpappy" =).
       Also, with Orion brewing up some ideas in his head about a
       unification, the dream is not too far from reality. It may as well
       happen, and soon... prepare for the unification.

                 " CD-RiPS Reply "
                 by Prozac

      "I saw an article in WWN #5 that intrigued me to reply. This was
       part of it: "Why are CD-RIP programs released over and over again?
       Sometimes they are packaged poorly, sometimes they are missing
       files, sometimes they are too big and sometimes they don't work
       properly.  What's so difficult?" - LOD

      What's so difficult? Time. Time is against groups to get the
       stuff off the CD, on to the hard drive, ARJ it up, then release it.
       No time to check it, no time to see if it'll work on other systems.
       There isn't any time. Thanks to group rivalaries to get the hottest
       warez the fastest, and be the first ones to release it, groups are
       pressured to release as fast as they can.  Unforuntely, it's
       usually not tested.

      There is also another problem with cd-rips. Groups can release
       it now, and see what was the problem and release a fix (and another
       release), or hope that some other group will fix it for them. It's
       basically "Release now, fix later." One example is DOD's Win95
       release. It was missing some crucial files, and 4 groups released
       fixes for it, including DOD. DOD knew that another group would
       release it eventually, but they had to be the first to release it.
       There wouldn't be anytime to check it out (Note: I may be mistaken
       that DOD did test it before releasing it, but this is under my
       assumption they didn't).

      If the CD-RIP doesn't work, it's written as a "OOPS!", written
       off, swept under the rug of time, and wait for the next release.
       The scene does "forgive and forget" for bad releases, and the
       better your reputation is, the better the chance the scene will
       forgive (unless your persistantly releasing bad rips, then you get
       bitched out) and eventually forget. For example, Hoodlum and
       Vendetta has released bad rips (eg FXFighter and Thunderscape), and
       has not been forgiven since then. On the other hand, TDU, DOD, and
       PWA has released a bad rip every once in a while, but they are
       forgiven very quickly because they all have solid reps, as
       consistent quality groups.

      Lastly, no other group is willing to share with another group
       what they missed or messed up upon and how it could be avoided the
       next time. If group corporation would happen sometimes, instead of
       fueds, then more quality warez would be in scene, not crap. I don't
       know if I'm the only one, but I would LOVE some of TDU's secrets. ;)

          This week our interview is with Count Zero,one of the 
          founders of PiNNACLE. I talked with him so we could all
          get a little info on the past, present, and future of
          PiNNACLE.
                       
       WWN : What was the original idea behind Pinnacle?
       
       COUNT ZERO : Pinnacle was formed as an alternative to the
       "ego-trippin" and the "I am better than you" ideas.  We wanted to
       have a group that put the scene and releasing quality stuff ahead
       of people's egos. 
       
       WWN : Would you consider pinnacle a success as of now?
       
       COUNT ZERO : uhmm.. until the last couple weeks, yes.  but.. I
       basically see any group that if they release 1 thing 1 person
       needs, they are a success.
             
       WWN : Where do you see Pinnacle 6 months from now?
       
       COUNT ZERO : I see one of 2 things, A> we'll break up or B> we'll
       become the leading force in the scene, fending off other groups'
       merge offers..  that we got from DOD/ILS/NBK/MTY/PCY just the ones
       I know of!
        
       WWN : What is the one thing you hope that PNC will
       accomplish?
         
       COUNT ZERO : get back to supplying QUALiTY.. and Quantity..  and
       follow the old idea. that all ppl are equal in the crew..and no
       ego-trippin.. no power trippin.
       
       WWN : This past week, PNC made a few mistakes, what happened?
       
       COUNT ZERO : welps. as you know, Bish, Blazen and myself were all
       very busy..  and with us away, not as many releases came up..  SO,
       I think the others were strugglin' to get any release possible..
       and we didn't follow thru as thoroughly as we should have to check
       is a release was already up we just need to get our communication
       back up properly.
         
       WWN : What can we expect from PNC in the upcoming weeks?
       
       COUNT ZERO : uhmm.. a Trimming down of the crew, alot more quality
       PPE's several quality utils <and a few games too!> and a rush fer
       #1.
             
       WWN : Is PNC branching out into the Games scene?
           
       COUNT ZERO : We are planning on it.. a few of our new suppliers are
       in that area..  but, as we have been in the past, and will be again
       soon, you can expect QUALiTY not quantity.

       And that concluded our interview, hope you learned something.

---=[ 7. Announcements - "Mercury Says Goodbye" ]=-------------------------------

      This, will be my last Week in Warez Newsletter. As you read in
       issue #5, I had a minor accident and had to go to the hospital, and
       couldn't release the mag. However, now i am back, and now i am even
       more sad to say that I am leaving once again, with the upcoming
       fall session of school, I am a very busy man, and cannot deal with
       releasing a magazine on a weekly basis, that is why, I have
       assigned Lester, an associate of WWN to take over as my postion. He
       will now be releasing the magazine, along with Cypress. Hopefully,
       I pray he does a good job of it. :) I also am assigning Cyber Angel
       (if he wishes it so) to do the job along with Lester, he & lester
       know the workings of WWN very well, and I am sure they can do more
       than an able job with the magazine.  I will be not around much....
       very busy, but you can still send me e-mail to mercury@escape.com ,
       but i doubt i will be able to answer it :).  Well, as a last note,
       i would like to greet the following people:

       Jimmy Jamez & Cyber Angel:  My 2 Favorite Russians in the scene :)
                JJ, thanks for all your help with the mag

      Welcome to Poo's House - the DoD Private iNET FTP HQ Site

       Whats up scrubs!

      PooBiS here! Well I'm back from my hiatus, and Poo's House is
       back now as well. If you are wondering to yourself, "What the
       fuck!? I can't connect to the site!" Maybe it's because you're a
       lamer. If not, it could be because the site has changed IP's.
       Furthermore, I had to clean the userbase (which was about 100
       strong at that point) because of the few lamers that were slipping
       through the cracks onto the site. So if you want access to the new
       and improved Poo's House, you gotta get in touch with me on iRC
       ASAP.  The school year is starting soon, and I wont have time to
       add people as quickly as I have been, so if ya want/need/gotta have
       access, let me know soon, or you're outta gas...........
       Until then.....

                     Peace and humptiness forever,
                           PooBiS -DoD-

 Quick little shout outs: Mercury (Miss ya son!), Khufu (Sell out!),
 JJ (spasibo!), CyberAngel (How's Brooklyn Tech? heh), Warlock (NT blows),
 MagicMn (Roar!), KrAkHed (Leech!), MikeySoft (Tard... say my name.. say it!)
 Oyl (Grandma!) And all you other niglets...... keep it real!!!!
